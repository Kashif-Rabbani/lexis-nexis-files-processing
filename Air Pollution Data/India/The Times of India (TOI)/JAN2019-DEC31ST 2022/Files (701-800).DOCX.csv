Wear masks for protection from air pollution: Doctors,"PATNA: As the city's air quality index (AQI) level continues to remain in the ""very poor"" zone, health experts have advised people to wear masks to protect themselves from both Covid and pollution. ""Polluted air can have a major impact on respiratory health, especially on people with lung, heart diseases, asthma and those who suffered serious ailments during the second wave of Covid pandemic,"" they said.The number of patients experiencing respiratory problems has increased at the outpatient departments (OPDs) of different health facilities in the city due to the deterioration in air quality.Dr Sanjiv Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P), said deterioration in air quality would affect people's respiratory system and cause cardiovascular diseases.""Exposure to particulate matters can affect lung and heart. With the rise in pollution, the level of carbon dioxide has also increased, causing breathlessness especially to those suffering from comorbidities. /It can also affect heart because of acidosis (build-up of acid in the bloodstream), which occurs when kidneys and lungs cannot keep body's pH in balance. In this situation, people get easily fatigued (respiratory) and it also causes depression in cardiovascular. Those whose lungs are already compromised during the second wave of pandemic will be more affected,"" Dr Kumar said.Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, an epidemiologist at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital-Patna, said there has been a rise in number of patients suffering from asthma, lung and heart diseases as well as tuberculosis due to rise in pollution level. ""If we compare with the previous year, the number of patients with respiratory problems is more in the OPD this year,"" he said, adding people should wear face masks to keep diseases at bay.Dr A K Ashu, joint director of Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology, said poor air quality could also affect healthy individuals. ""People should use mask to avoid respiratory and other health problems. The society should also contribute to control the rising level of pollution. In Patna, there is very little paving. If paving is not possible, there should be grass over it, which is the natural way of controlling air pollution. Just sprinkling water on roads will not help much,"" he added.

Lawyer seeks Rs 15L as bad-air compensation from govts,"New Delhi: A lawyer has moved the Delhi High Court seeking Rs 15 lakh as compensation and medical insurance of Rs 25 lakh in view of the poor air quality in the capital.On Tuesday, justice Yashwant Varma posted the plea for December 6, after the petitioner did not appear initially when the case was called.""Please understand, the high court is not a playground and you should desist from using it as one,"" the judge advised the petitioner, who appeared when the case was called for hearing once again in the end.The court also asked the petitioner to approach the Supreme Court if he was concerned with the capital's air quality, as the apex court is already looking into the issue. However, the advocate submitted that he has sought health insurance for himself from the Centre and the AAP government on account of the air quality. /In his petition, he has also sought Rs 15 lakh as compensation for ""specific and exemplary damages"" caused to him. The plea has also claimed that air pollution can also cause serious lung diseases and cancer.It said the SC already expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Constitution of India by holding the ""Right to clean pollution-free environment"" as a fundamental right. The petitioner has also prayed for a direction to the authorities to immediately seal the factories that are manufacturing firecrackers in the Delhi-NCR and the shops selling them.

National Pollution Control Day: Tips to maintain a healthy environment at home,"As the modern lifestyle continues to evolve; a phenomenon that has been further accelerated during the pandemic, is that of 'staying at home.' The fact that so many of daily our tasks today can be performed efficiently without stepping out of our homes, has given rise to the 'indoor generation', that is now spending almost 90% of the time indoors. Hence, what is surprising, especially in India, is that the awareness about the menace and hazards arising out of indoor pollution is hardly proportionate to what one is being exposed to for most part of the day.  The air in your home can contain a myriad of substances, from particles like dust, pet dander and allergens to gases, VOCs (Volatile organic compounds), NO2 and benzene. /These are a result of regular human behaviour and activities that we follow in our everyday life like cleaning homes using disinfects, use if incense sticks; cooking, especially deep frying, smoking etc; are a major source of airborne particles that contribute to pollutants in households. These pollutants are often not visible to the naked eye and can create an unhealthy indoor environment. Dyson Engineer Sam Taylor has following tips to keep your hope free of pollution Use cleaning products wiselySome of the VOCs found in our homes can come from the chemicals in cleaning products we use on kitchen surfaces, bathrooms, and windows. Limonene is one of the compounds that makes cleaning products smell like citrus, but it can react with naturally-occurring ozone in the home to create Formaldehyde. Using natural cleaning products can help lower the amount of VOCs in your indoor air. Vacuum regularlyA research conducted in Indian households and associate cars shows that bacteria, dust mite and dog and cockroach allergens were found where we sleep, sit and play. Keep your carpets, hard floors, upholstery and surfaces free of dust and pet hair - most effectively by vacuuming. When you sit on the sofa or plump up a cushion, you might also notice a dust cloud. This dust will remain in the air and can be breathed in but vacuuming regularly is an easy way to decrease particulate pollution at home. Use scented products in moderationSome of the things we might enjoy at home, like scented candles, can also be sources of indoor air pollution. Rather than avoiding them completely, try lighting candles only in moderation - for example in the evening - and ensuring that you ventilate the room, or use a purifier afterwards to help remove any remaining VOCs or particulate matter from the air. Be wary when letting in ""fresh air"": If you live next to a busy road or train line, opening the window can allow outdoor pollution, gases like NO2 and sulphur dioxide, into your home. Watch what you are cooking Be aware that when you are cooking at home, some cooking methods can create pollution. Frying with oil can create particulate pollution and using a gas stove can also create gaseous pollutants like NO2. When cooking, make sure to use suitable ventilation, or a purifier or open a window if the outdoor air pollution is suitable.Buy an air purifierAir purifiers come in various shapes and sizes, remove different kinds of air pollutants in your homes, come with an array of specifications, and offer different features. Keep in mind the following tips when you buya. In real life, the only way to truly know how well an air purifier is working is to monitor the air quality. Some air purifiers offer sensing capabilities and are smart enough to respond by purifying the air automatically when pollutants are detected. To be able to sense, a purifier needs on-board air quality sensors. It should also have software and electronics that will allow it to process that information and react intelligently to purify the air. b. There are multiple methods of filtration in purifiers to consider. Ultraviolet light uses electromagnetic radiation to destroy bacteria, viruses and mould. However, it does not remove dust, allergens or particles in the air. Some machines have fully-sealed filters - that don't allow the airflow to bypass the filter media, so you can be sure the machine is properly filtering the air of particles and gases. Dual filters - HEPA or other types of particle filter remove particle pollutants from the air, like dust, pollen and pet dander. If you can, also look for a machine with an activated carbon filter that will absorb VOCs, NO2 and other gases.c. Finally, projection is an important consideration. Aside from sensing and capturing pollutants, some purifiers can help circulate purified air across the room. This can help in situations where purifiers are placed in the far corner, or the far end of a room. In order to support air circulation and to distribute purified air to people who are some distance away from the machine, some purifiers also double up as fans, that project clean air across the room, not just in the corner where the machine is sitting.

"How Tackling Pollution Can Help Delhi Save Rs 1,000cr/yr","New Delhi: The advisories and precautions by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) can save Delhi Rs 1,096 crore per year on health expenditure, claims a study. Co-authored by the central forecasting agency's founder project director, Gufran Beig, the study asserts that even if only 5% of the population suffering from air pollution-related ailments uses SAFAR's advices and precautions, over a thousand crore can be saved per year. ""Our findings support the notion that public knowledge and early warning remain critical components of health and economic growth. /SAFAR is credited with saving 11-14% of total money spent by such residents, according to this research,"" said Beig. ""Impact of SAFAR Air Quality Forecasting Framework and Advisory Services in Reducing the Economic Health Burden of India"", published in the international journal ""Regional Economic Development Research"", is written by Suvarna Tikle, Ishika Ilme and Beig, and talks of pulmonary disease linked with air pollution, allergic rhinitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. It considers the total population of Delhi at 2.2 crore, percentage of people suffering from pulmonary illnesses and the cost they bear at hospitals. The study estimates that besides basic treatment, costs of hospitalisation and ICU can be saved. It talks of prevention by intervention through an early warning about the pollution situation. The warning includes suggesting people to avoid going out or prolonged exposure, barring outdoor activities, on the predicted polluted days. ""A crucial finding indicates that the yearly average total cost of all ailments caused by air pollution in Delhi and Pune is around Rs 7,694 crore and Rs 948 crore, respectively. Allergic rhinitis OPD treatment costs the highest (Rs 1,449 crore), followed by asthma (Rs 1,001 crore), and COPD (Rs 514 crore) in Delhi."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Is winter ""heart failure season""?","Studies show that hospitalization and mortality rates of heart failure patients are higher during winter season. This is majorly because the rapid drop in temperature causes various physiological changes that leads to worsening of disease.Heart failure can be effectively managed through timely treatment at an early stage, following treatment schedules, lifestyle modifications and regular check-ups with the cardiologist.According to Dr. Vishal Rastogi, Additional Director, Cardiac Sciences, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, New Delhi, ""During winter season, there is a rise in incidence of conditions like chest infection, increased heart rate and blood pressure that can worsen heart failure. Low temperatures can cause blood vessels to narrow and restrict blood flow adding more strain to the heart. In our clinical observation, we see around 20-30% of heart failure patients getting hospitalized during winter season. /Therefore, for heart failure patients, timely treatment is crucial for effective management of their condition, especially in winters. One should follow their prescribed treatment regularly along with healthy lifestyle and dietary modifications.""Here are few risk factors for Heart Failure, especially in winters:High Blood Pressure: Cold weather can cause fluctuation in blood pressure levels and an increase in the heart rate. Consequently, this can lead to hospitalizations in Heart Failure patients.Air pollution: During winters, smog and pollutants tend to settle closer to the ground thereby increasing the chances of chest infections and breathing problems. Heart failure patients normally experience shortness of breath and pollutants can worsen their symptoms, which can lead to hospitalization in severe cases. Lack of perspiration: Low temperatures reduce perspiration. As a result, the body might not be able to get rid of the extra water and it can cause fluid build-up in lungs, worsening the cardiac function in heart failure patients.Lack of Vitamin D: Vitamin D prevents the build-up of scar tissues in the heart which protects against heart failure, post a heart attack. In winters, due to lack of proper exposure to sunlight, low Vitamin D levels tend to increase the risk of Heart Failure.Take care of your heart during winterAwareness about the 'winter effect' should encourage patients and their families to pay closer attention to symptoms of heart failure and manage the condition with proper medication and lifestyle changes. Heart Failure patients and people with pre-existing heart conditions should be particularly careful during winter season and incorporate the following regime:Visit your cardiologist and keep your blood pressure in checkReduce consumption of water and salt as we do not perspire much during winters Heart Failure patients should exercise regularly, however, indoor exercises are recommended to avoid extreme weather conditionsDon't forget / skip your medication, even if you are feeling betterProtect yourself against winter ailments - cough, cold, flu etc.-By Dr Vishal Rastogi, Additional Director, Cardiac Sciences, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, New DelhiDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the doctors are their independent professional judgment and we do not take any responsibility for the accuracy of their views.

"Madhya Pradesh: Winter here, air quality worsens","BHOPAL: The air quality of major Madhya Pradesh cities has turned poor. Pollution levels have sharply gone up after clearing of the monsoon in the state. The pollution levels of major MP cities had gone up to at least 100 points compared to last year.Among the four main cities, pollution in Jabalpur increased almost double while there was no major change in the pollution level of Gwalior. /<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/In Bhopal and Indore, the air pollution level turned from moderate to poor in the past one year.Officials said pollution levels go up after monsoon. Dust gets heavy in showers and does not fly in the air. The vehicular pollution also gets down as tyres could not lead to flying of pollutants and dust in air, as it settles down on ground.It is the reason why pollution levels come down during rains. But damaged roads, flying dust from vehicles and increase in construction activities after showers leads to increase in the pollution levels.Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, the increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage, among others. PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases.Air quality index between 0 and 50 is termed as good with minimal possible health impacts while air quality between 51 and 100 is satisfactory but may lead to minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people. Air quality above 100 is moderate and leads to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases.AQI above 200 leads to breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. AQI between 300 and 400 is very poor and leads to respiratory illness on prolonged exposure.Officials said the air quality remained best during the corona restrictions when the AQI of major MP cities was around 50.

Track the pollution level in your city,'Very poor' air quality in Patna poses health threat to people,"PATNA: The city continued to witness ""very poor"" air quality for the second day in a row on Monday with rise in pollutants like particulate matter (PM)10 and PM2.5 in the air.The air quality index (AQI) level of Patna stood at 301 on Monday due to calm wind, haze and other meteorological conditions which are unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants in the air. On Sunday, the city's AQI was recorded at 304. However, the air quality is likely to improve marginally over the next two days due to winds coming from west.As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin, the overall AQI of 301 for Patna was the average of AQI level at DRM office-Khagaul (363), Eco Park (356), BIT-Mesra, Patna (350), Planetarium (347), S K Memorial Hall (281) and Patna City (108). A ""very poor"" AQI essentially means that people may suffer respiratory illnesses on prolonged exposure to such air and it may have more pronounced effect in people with lung and heart diseases.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"".Apart from Patna, the AQI of Bettiah rose to 350, Bhagalpur 332, Biharsharif 414, Buxar 359, Chhapra 353, Darbhanga 376, Katihar 343, Kishanganj 355, Muzaffarpur 369, Purnia 335, Saharsa 352 and Sasaram 319. Of 20 most polluted cities in the country on the CPCB list, most were from Bihar.Ankita Jyoti, senior programme officer at Centre for Environment and Energy Development, said the minimum temperature has declined by few notches in Patna, leading to rise in air pollution. /""Low temperature and moisture in the air trap pollutants close to the surface. Seasonal sources of pollution, such as farm fires and bonfires also lead to rise in temperature. Besides, other human-made activities lead to smog,"" she added.On Saturday, 98 farmers were caught for stubble burning in Patna during a raid by the district officials. So far, 100 farmers have been caught for stubble burning in the district this year.Naveen Kumar, an environment scientist and analyst at Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), said several contributory sources were responsible for rise in air pollution in the region, including sudden drop in temperature, low wind velocity and formation of thermal inversion condition which trapped the pollutants in the air.

"At 4.2 degrees, Meerut coldest city in UP","Agra/Meerut: Meerut was the coldest city in Uttar Pradesh on Saturday, registering a minimum temperature of 4.2 degrees, 4 degrees below normal. In Agra, the minimum temperature was a notch higher at 6.5 degree Celsius. According to the meteorological department, following the western disturbance in Himalayan along with its induced circulation over north Rajasthan and adjoining Haryana, the western parts of Uttar Pradesh will witness cold winds with shallow fog in the morning. /However, there is no indication of rainfall, especially in the Agra region. Principal scientist N Subhash at Meerut-based Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Agriculture University said, ""Saturday's maximum temperature was 15.6 degrees Celsius, which is 7 degrees lower than the normal, while minimum was 4.2 degrees. On Sunday, the intense cold will persist as minimum temperature is expected to fall to 2-3 degrees Celsius accompanied by cold winds while maximum will hover around 15-16 degrees."" Chilly winds blowing at the speed of 12 km per hour made people shiver on Saturday in the Agra region. While the minimum temperature was 6.5 degree Celsius, the maximum temperature was 19.6 degree Celsius, four notches less than the normal. People lit bonfires to get some relief from the extreme weather.Neighboring districts of Firozabad, Mathura, Etah, Aligarh and Mainpuri were also cooled by chilly winds. At many places, people lit bonfires to get some relief from the extreme weather. The change in weather has resulted in an increase in the number of patients suffering from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases visiting hospitals. Firozabad medical college principal Dr Sangeeta Aneja said, ""Following extreme weather conditions, the number of patients having cardiovascular and respiratory issues has increased. However, our major concern is the increase in the cases of children suffering from pneumonia and hypothermia. At present, 20 infants are under treatment at the newborn care unit. In case of rapid breathing or fever, parents should immediately take the child to the doctor."" Additional director of the health department, Agra, Dr AK Singh, said, ""People need to follow some basic precautions in the current weather conditions. Direct exposure to cold winds should be avoided. All body parts, especially feet and head, should be properly covered."" He advised that people should consume a calorie-rich diet, but oily and spicy food should be avoided. Lukewarm water should be taken at frequent intervals. Early morning walks and exercise in open spaces should be avoided for a few days. Wearing a face mask when going out is recommended. Children, senior citizens need special care, and patients of diabetes, blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases are advised to see a doctor immediately in case of health issues,"" Singh added. Meanwhile, cold winds helped in lowering air pollution levels in Agra. As compared to 208 or ""poor"" category on Friday, the air quality index (AQI) in Agra on Saturday was recorded at 117 or ""moderate"" category by the Central Pollution Control Board.

94% in Chandrapur feel pollution taking toll on health: Study,"Chandrapur: Pollution in Chandrapur has reached an alarming level and it has adversely affected people's health, feel 94.2 % of citizens who responded to a sample survey carried out by a group of medical practitioners and environmentalists. While 75.1% people have attributed the cause of their ailment to high pollution, 60% citizens feel that they are irritated by high air and noise pollution leading to early exhaustion, sleeplessness, lack of focus on work, spark of anger and headaches.Environmentalist Dr Yogeshwar Dudhpachare along with medical practitioner Dr Ashok Wasalwar and Dr Saurav Rajurkar conducted this online survey with the help of 22 point questionnaire to understand the effects of pollution, especially air pollution, on people's health. ""The survey received responses from 430 persons. /Of them, 64% people feel that their life spanhas decreased by some years due to pollution,"" said Dr Wasalwar and added that even those who don't smoke have the effect of smoking 10 cigarettes a day on their lungs in Chandrapur. As per the study findings, 67.3% people claimed they are suffering from one or other skin diseases and high acidity while 29.5% said they have at least one patient and 20% said they have got 2 patients with skin diseases at home. Those suffering from cold, frequent sneezing and runny noses constituted 77%. Contracting a disease due to high water pollution is a concern for 83% respondents. Investing in real estate would give returns in the negative, feel 69% people. In fact, 70% agreed to leave Chandrapur for better opportunities elsewhere.Pulmonologist Dr Saurabh Rajurkar said high pollution responsible for higher cases of respiratory disorders and heart and lungs ailments in children as well as adults. ""There are a high number of patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The number of heart failure patients too is rising,"" he said and added that there is high number of newborn to 12 years of age children with asthma or some pollution related allergy in Chandrapur.

Patna's air quality continues to remain in 'very poor' zone,"PATNA: Residents of Patna woke up to a ""very poor"" air quality for the second day in a row on Wednesday as cold wave conditions continued in the city. The air quality index (AQI) level of Patna was recorded at 311 owing to low temperatures and calm winds which resulted in stagnant weather conditions, not allowing enough ventilation for dispersion of pollutants.According to the bulletin of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the overall AQI of Patna was based on the readings of continuous ambient air quality monitoring centres - Eco Park (380), Planetarium (369) DRM office-Khagaul (329) and Patna City (152), where the prominent pollutant was PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 micron). S K Memorial Hall (320) and BIT-Mesra, Patna (315) were also in ""very poor"" zone.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"" and 401 and 500 ""severe"". A ""very poor"" AQI essentially means that people may suffer respiratory illness on prolonged exposure to such air and it may have more pronounced effect in people with lung and heart diseases.Ashok Ghosh, chairman of Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), said climatic condition and anthropogenic activities were responsible for deterioration in air quality. /""Sudden rise in temperature, low wind velocity and smog in the environment have led to rise in air pollution. We are working on the clean air action plan with the departments concerned and a committee has also been formed at chief secretary-level to monitor the situation,"" he said.Ghosh added at a recent meeting, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change had assured financial support to all states. ""They also reviewed the utilization of funds by the states for the action plan. Bihar has fared well with 90% utilization. We have allocated the funds to different departments and municipal corporations. They are in the process of procurement of equipment, machines and CNG buses,"" Ghosh said.He added, ""The air quality has not deteriorated in a day or two. We have continuously abused the environment over the years. It will now take time to restore the quality of air. The Centre and the state have taken this issue seriously and we will see the improvement in year or two. However, it should be a collective effort of all states as the pollutants also come from the neighbouring states."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Smoke-spewing factories, brick kilns choke Jhajjar","Jhajjar: Home to 415 brick kilns, 650 industries, 16 hot mix plants and five stone crushes, Jhajjar is one of Haryana's 14 districts in the National Capital Region which has recorded a steep slide in air quality, a direct corollary of air fouled by dirty diesel exhaust fumes, construction dust, rising industrial emissions, road dust and crop burning.The average air quality index (AQI) in the district has been recorded in the 'very poor' category since November. While the average December AQI (until 25th of the month) was recorded at 320, the overall November AQI was around 347, several notches up from an AQI of 293 recorded in the corresponding period last year.Elderly people, used to the clear, sunny winters, said the morning sky glowed like an ominous shade of orange. ""We can barely see down the street these days during the morning walks. Stepping out for a walk or work early in the morning or late at night cause breathing issues. /The pandemic has made the situation scarier,"" Suresh Singh, a resident of Sector 16, said.With infrastructure projects underway in areas like Beri Road, Badli Road and Sector 9 bypass, residents said there was no respite from suspended dust particles. ""The problem is that these suspended particles linger even after the air has cleared. Scant rainfall year after year ensures that it does not settle down. These tiny specks, we fear, can increase the risk of acute respiratory infections, especially in children and older adults,"" Karamvir Dahiya, a resident of Beri Road, said.'All is not local'Experts claim the source of air pollution in Jhajjar is not entirely local. ""Jhajjar is not a very urbanised district and does not have many active and modern sources of emissions but is surrounded by industries and brick kilns that are major pollution sources. It is also a major rice cultivation region in the state and sees some instances of stubble burning,"" Shubhansh Tiwari, a research associate at Amity Centre for Air Pollution Control, told TOI.Executive director of research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) Anumita Roychowdhury, meanwhile, pressed for a holistic mitigation plan. ""Pollution sources do not change through the year. What changes in winter is that cold air settles close to the ground and trap pollutants. When Delhi and its surrounding cities choke, it's not necessarily when stubble burning is at its peak, but when weather conditions are conducive. It is the same here,"" she said.Action still not takenThe district at present is dependent on its lone ambient air quality station at Bahadurgarh mini secretariat. This, experts said, was insufficient to screen the air quality of a district spread across 1,834 square kilometres.  The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), however, has no plan to increase the number of air monitoring stations. ""We have installed an online station to monitor the ambient air quality of Bahadurgarh town and have two manual ambient air quality stations. We also have prepared an action plan to mitigate pollution in the district,"" Dinesh Kumar, the regional officer of HSPCB, said. Civic agencies, including the municipal council, traffic police, HSIIDC and the pollution board, have begun a crackdown on illegally parked vehicles on the congested roads, he said. The civic agencies will start sprinkling water on dust patches, mechanical sweeping of roads, and initiating work to fill potholes. The pollution board has been tasked to ensure that all building materials are covered and anti-smog guns installed at all construction sites, Kumar said, adding work is on towards phasing out petrol and diesel vehicles that are over 15 and 10 years old, respectively.

No let-up in winter woes as smog cover tightened grip over NCR,"Ghaziabad/Noida: Schools shut for a few days, entry of trucks, burning garbage in landfills and civil construction banned, and closure of all brick kilns - the districts in the National Capital Region (NCR) rushed in a series of quick fixes for its annual pollution woes since the first week of November, a bit earlier than the years preceding it, but the air quality index (AQI), which measures the concentration of particulate matter in the air, had hit the ""severe"" and ""very poor"" levels even faster.On a scale of up to 500, where anything above 100 is considered unhealthy by the Central Pollution Control Board, the overall air quality in Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida was recorded around 377, 369 and 340, respectively, in November. Ghaziabad and Noida saw 10 and nine 'severe' air days in the month, respectively, which was same as the corresponding period in the preceding year. Greater Noida, meanwhile, recorded five 'severe' air days this year and seven such days in the same period in 2020.December was no better. Until Christmas, the average AQI of Ghaziabad (315.6), Noida (309.8) and Greater Noida (285.44) continued to oscillate between the 'very poor' and 'poor' categories.The stumbling blocksA combination of man-made causes like smoke from stubble burning, inherent issues of pollution from vehicles, construction sites and waste burning, and meteorological factors like wind direction, dip in temperature, moisture presence led to the formation of smog, a heady cocktail of toxins, smoke and fog continue to turn Delhi-NCR into a 'gas chamber' each winter.Vikrant Sharma, a Ghaziabad-based environmentalist, said an analysis of the AQI data during peak winter months - November, December and January -- for the last three years shows that severe episodic air pollution blankets are a result of a combination of factors, including geographical conditions of the region that are more conducive to trap pollutants at the lower level of the atmosphere.""While the meteorological factors are beyond control but it seems the civic agencies and administration are not doing enough to abate emissions from all anthropogenic sources. /Controlling construction and demolition (C&D) pollution is definitely possible with a little manpower and willpower, but they have failed miserably,"" Sharma said.A status report submitted to the Supreme Court by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) in December had indicated that Uttar Pradesh did little to ensure that industries in their NCR districts switch to cleaner fuels and only 50% of factories in the region - 1,160 out of 2,273 - had shifted to clean fuels. The CAQM had on August 12 issued directions to Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to make industrial units in NCR switch to a cleaner fuel. On dust control measures, the report said Delhi had partially followed the steps suggested by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), but listed UP in the ""poorly complied"" category. Stitches in timeThe Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC), as per official sources, has replaced 579 diesel-run vehicles, converting 60% of them into CNG.General manager (projects) for Greater Noida Authority AK Arora told TOI that the Authority imposed a total of Rs 45 lakh as penalty on 40 units, including an RMC plant and construction sites, for violation of National Green Tribunal's norms. He added a three lakh square feet area, including Greater Noida (west) and near Greater Noida Authority office area, was also grassed over.""The GB Nagar and Ghaziabad administrations also resorted to frequently sweeping roads - mechanised and manual -- and sprinkling water to control dust pollution,"" Sharma said. Among the few other measures that the two district administrations took to check pollution include installing a smog tower on the Delhi-Noida Direct (DND) flyway in Noida, implementing GRAP measures from mid-October, and creating teams to check open burning of garbage/industrial waste.""Factories located in NCR were directed to put basic industry-related information on their chimneys at the insistence of state pollution control board to keep an eye on polluting units. This to some extent helped to keep industrial pollution in check,"" Sharma added.Looking forwardUnder the 15th Finance Commission, Ghaziabad municipal commissioner Mahendra Singh Tanwar said, the district has received Rs 121 crore to control pollution and the sum will be disbursed in two instalments. ""Till date, we have been working on improving the roads to control dust pollution and a sum of Rs 42 crore has been earmarked for it. Another Rs 20 crore has been allocated to install green topping of pavements. The administration is spending Rs 10 crore to replace its diesel-run fleet with CNG-fitted vehicles. Ten water sprinklers and mechanized road sweeping machines have been sweeping a 77-km stretch. The results will be discernable next year,"" Tanwar added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Stone crushers, industries: What's making Nuh gasp","Nuh: Smoke from hundreds of stone-loaded trucks that enter the district every day to reach its 52 stone crushers and the toxic emissions from nearly 150 industries leave a curtain of smog hanging over Nuh, one of Haryana's 14 districts in the National Capital Region (NCR) located about 103.2 km from the national capital. This curtain has been growing thicker over the last few years, especially during winter, like most NCR districts. According to the Central Pollution Control Board data, the district recorded an average air quality index (AQI) of 201 (on a scale up to 500) in November last year, almost as 'poor' as 200 recorded in 2020, while the overall December AQI last year was 115, which is in the 'moderate' category.Despite being a rural district with a lot of open spaces, more and more people are complaining of respiratory disorders and eye infections each year, Kashim, a resident of the Quershi market area, told TOI. ""This is mainly because of the increasing movement of trucks in the area. /These drivers do not cover the heavy vehicles loaded with stones, etc, and are among the main sources of dust pollution,"" he said.For Rizwan, a resident of Biwan, pollution caused by the scores of infrastructure projects underway near Bypass, Jhirka Chowk, Kashim Alawalpur, and Biwan, acts as a slow poison. ""But it is the dust from the under-construction Delhi-Mumbai Expressway that is choking residents of nearby areas. Every tree in the area is now covered by a thick coat of dust. We hardly see a day with clear blue sky during October and November,"" he said.Musa, a resident of Naushera village, meanwhile, blamed big infra projects for not following dust mitigation norms and the local authorities for doing little to help. ""Water is not being sprinkled on the under-construction Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, and the construction material is mostly left uncovered - if we are not going to get any benefit out of it then why should we be made to suffer?"" he asks.TOI found that the district does not have a proper waste management system and residents mostly dump waste on roads near their houses, which poses a major health hazard. ""There is no dumping ground here. People are used to throwing waste on the roads that are infrequently cleaned by the authorities concerned,"" Rewasan-resident Atif said. 'Need to increasegreen cover'According to Shubhansh Tiwari, a research associate at Amity Centre for Air Pollution Control, air pollution in Nuh was a little complex. ""Firstly, the district is surrounded by many micro- and medium-scale industries mostly making auto parts, engineering components and chemicals. Secondly, major highways, like the NH 48, passes through the district. These, and local sources, like traffic congestion and waste burning, are major reasons for the air pollution in Nuh. Long-range transportation of pollutants - due to stubble burning in Punjab and dust storms in Thar desert - is also a major contributor,"" he said.Experts, meanwhile, have highlighted the immediate need to increase green cover in the district. ""What we need is to plant more trees to increase the green cover which can act as a protective barrier to keep the oxygen balance in the region. Air quality can improve if we aim to increase the source of dust absorption green patches,"" Anumita Roychowdhury, the executive director of research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) told TOI.Mitigation planRecently, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) shut down 26 stone crushers for non-compliance with air pollution control measures (APCMs). It has also readied an action plan to mitigate air pollution which includes sprinkling water on dust patches, mechanical sweeping of roads, and initiating work to repair roads and drains. The pollution board has been also tasked to ensure that all construction sites should cover building materials and install anti-smog guns, and deploy teams to check pollution certificates of vehicles plying on roads.""Regular inspections of industries and construction sites are being carried out by our teams. Inspections are being carried out from time to time and challans issued for garbage dumping and burning,"" Vijay Chaudhary, HSPCB regional officer, said, adding that the municipal committee has also identified a dumping site.

"Navi Mumbai: Illegally dumped garbage being burnt in residential area at Palaspe in Panvel, citizens complain about health hazards","NAVI MUMBAI: Heaps of garbage collected from households in Palaspe village and adjoining residential areas is being dumped illegally on the open space adjoining the upcoming Tower Project 'Arihant Aspire' at Palaspe abutting the Goa highway. As the dumped garbage consists of glass, plastics, and other hazardous materials, the burning such dumped waste leads to release of toxic gases in the air and can cause considerable damage to the lungs of residents in the vicinity. Citizens have alleged that this seems to be a well-thought of conspiracy by the Palaspe Grampanchayat to save on the expenses of transporting the garbage to the designated dumping ground. /However, Palaspe Sarpanch has refuted the allegations blaming the grampanchayat authorities of garbage menace on the open space in Palaspe.Vogetty Parshuram (49), a chartered accountant having office at Palaspe alleged, ""Though, the dumped garbage has to be picked up from this location and dumped at the designated landfill site in Taloja MIDC area, it has been observed that for past three years, only part of the garbage is being picked up for dumping at landfill site, while a major part of garbage is left at the open space and is been burnt, that leads to air pollution due to heavy smoke and continuous bad odour throughout the year.""Another resident Sagar Patil (50) from Palaspe alleged, ""The garbage burning in the vicinity of residential area seems to be a well-thought of conspiracy by the concerned gram panchayat, seemingly to save on expenses of transporting the garbage to the designated dumping ground in Taloja MIDC area. The garbage dumping and then burning it is being done in spite of various prestigious housing projects in the vicinity, such as Marathon Next, Sai World City, Arihant Aspire, India Bulls etc. which are almost complete or ready for possession. Due to the dumped garbage being burnt and release of toxic gases, those residing in these projects will surely face considerable health problems in the future if something this menace is not stopped. Also, during covid third wave, as the covid patients suffer from lung infection, the garbage burning and release of toxic gases will only aggravated their ailment.""Chandrakant Bhoir, Sarpanch of Palaspe gram panchayat said, ""The daily garbage collected from households in Palaspe grampanchayat area is being accumulated at the enclosed dumping ground abut Palaspe bridge. After a truck load of garbage is accumulated, we transport the garbage to the landfill site in Taloja MIDC for disposing the garbage in a scientific manner at the garbage treatment plant. However, some miscreants from neighbouring villages are dumping garbage outside the fenced compound wall of our dumping ground and then burn that garbage. Recently, our village youths had even thrashed some miscreants after catching them red-handed for garbage dumping outside our dumping ground's compound wall."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Animated films to clear the haze on air pollution,"Nagpur: Public awareness of air pollution and its health threats has always been low. Educating people on the gravity of air pollution are school students Kanchan, Saira and Raghav, who from their classrooms are not just telling the world about the increasing toxicity but also measures to mitigate it.To grab public attention on the catastrophe, NGO Asar, in collaboration with India Climate Collaborative (ICC), has released animated films which focus on key areas of air pollution including sources, impacts on health, and solutions. ""Three quirky school-going friends get together to dispel myths on air pollution and explore its various aspects through a series of five films. /These 90-second to 140-second films are currently being circulated in three languages - a combination of English and Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi. They are in the process of being dubbed into Tamil among other regional languages,"" stated a press release.Highlighting presence of a huge vacuum where people, especially children, are unable to understand how poor air quality affects health, Brikesh Singh, director (communications and engagement), Asar, said, ""Worsening air quality is a severe problem across India but it's not understandable to everyone. Available material is often technical and uses acronyms and jargon. These videos cut through the haze and deliver what's essential.""The films are unbranded and freely available for anyone to use as part of their educational programs, campaigns, and other communications to amplify conversations on air pollution, Singh added.Isha Chawla, communications, India Climate Collaborative, said the idea is to break down the complex issue of air pollution in an easy-to-understand, accessible format. ""There is lack of a strong, cohesive narrative focused on the solutions to air pollution. To enable this, we realised it's essential to support the creation of open-source tools like these videos,"" she added.These videos, which were released on January 22, have already received over 12,000 views across social media platforms. The films have been shared by the Early Childhood Association, which is a self-governing organisation of over 23,000 schools and pre-schools in the nation, formed by educationists and school administrators.

"Maharashtra: Deputy CM Ajit Pawar, most experts against dropping masks now","MUMBAI/PUNE: A day after state health minister Rajesh Tope said expert opinion was being sought on going mask-free in Maharashtra, deputy CM Ajit Pawar said the mask rule would continue till the coronavirus is eradicated.""As long as Covid is there, we have to wear the mask. There was no discussion on this, going mask-free, in the state cabinet. Whenever such a decision is taken, we will hold a press conference and tell everyone about it. We must continue to wear masks as long as there is Covid,"" Pawar said on Friday, on the sidelines of a visit to Worli, Mahim and Dadar to check tactical urbanism projects with environment minister Aaditya Thackeray.Tope's statement generated a huge debate across the country, with most experts supporting mask use in crowded hubs such as Mumbai. /They felt it would be unwise to ape Europe which has better vaccination numbers, less crowding and lesser air pollution.Epidemiologist Giridhar Babu, who is a member of the ICMR national task force on Covid, said: ""It is premature for implementation of mask-free regulations as of now.'' His argument was that once the rule is eased, it would be difficult to re-impose such public health regulations. Senior virologist Gagandeep Kang said: ""Masks outdoors in uncrowded settings never made sense, but in all other settings, it is a question of how much transmission is on in a community and how much risk we are willing to take.""In overcrowded cities such as Mumbai, public health experts believe habitual mask use would go a long way in keeping people healthy. Supporting the mask rule, BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said: ""We, at the BMC, found that a single rule to wash hands frequently had drastically reduced the incidence of water-borne diseases such as gastroenteritis and hepatitis. Mask use could similarly help us against infectious diseases such as TB, and pollution.""Those for dropping the mask had a scientific point: the milder Omicron wave has affected a majority and created protective antibodies, negating the need for masks. State Covid task force member Dr Gautam Bhansali said mask use should be discontinued as Covid-19 has become endemic. ""People who have a cough and cold or any respiratory illness should wear a mask, but it shouldn't be mandatory,"" he said.A senior doctor from the state health services said the mask rule has to go, but not immediately. ""People wear masks because of the rules and not for protection. How else would you explain the fact that people wear inferior masks or touch it so frequently that it is no longer sterile? Most reuse it for weeks. How can such unhygenic masks protect against Covid or any other respiratory virus?"" he asked.Top health experts in India and central task force members TOI spoke to said removing mask mandates cannot be universal. Additional director-general of ICMR-New Delhi Dr Samiran Panda likened adequate masking to wearing seat belts in cars or not smoking in public places. ""The elderly and those with comorbidities can benefit greatly from proper mask use, as it will help protect them not only against Covid, but also from other infections like influenza and the harmful effects of air pollution. Even the flu can be fatal for some elderly,"" he added.Dr Sanjay Pujari, another national task force member, said it may be premature to consider dropping the mask. ""...UK still recommends masking in healthcare settings, in indoor public gatherings, public transports and care homes. These recommendations are in the context of high booster coverage of the adult population, access to effective antivirals like Plaxovid as well as to rapid antigen tests.""

"Covid: Ending mask mandate can't be universal, say experts","PUNE: Removing mask mandates cannot be universal as a lot depends on how much risk one is willing to take, top health experts and central task force members told TOI on Friday, a day after state health minister Rajesh Tope spoke about seeking expert advice to make Maharashtra mask-free.Giridhar Babu, member of the epidemiology, surveillance and research group, ICMR national task force, said there was no evidence suggesting that being mask-free would be helpful during a pandemic. ""Available evidence overwhelmingly shows that mask use will provide a significant protective effect.""Samiran Panda, additional director-general of ICMR-New Delhi, likened adequate masking to wearing seat belt in a car or not smoking in public places. ""Mask mandates should be discussed from a public health perspective, weighing the risks against the benefits. /This requires an educated and informed discussion, rather than pointing what is right or wrong,"" Panda said.  Panda said, ""The elderly and those with comorbidities can benefit greatly from proper mask use, as it will help protect them not only against Covid, but also from other infections like influenza as well as the harmful effects of air pollution. Even the flu can be fatal for some elderly people.""Top virologist Gagandeep Kang said, ""Masks outdoors in uncrowded settings never made sense. But in all other settings, it is a question of how much transmission is happening in a community and how much risk we are willing to take."" Sanjay Pujari, a member of the ICMR national task force on clinical research for Covid-19, said it might be premature to consider universal removal of mask mandates at this stage of the pandemic. ""Masking mandates have been lifted by some countries like the UK, Denmark and some states in the USA. However, this is not universal as the UK still recommends masking in health care settings, in indoor public gatherings, public transports and care homes."" ""At this time, we do not clearly know when the pandemic will wane or cease and the likelihood of further variants emerging cannot be completely ruled out,"" Pujari further stated.

Air pollution: Maharashtra activists urge govt to issue public health warnings,"MUMBAI: Environmentalists have requested government and the local administration to issue Public Health Warnings in Mumbai and Maharashtra as and when the Air Quality Index (AQI) rises beyond safe health limits and reaches Poor, Very Poor or Hazardous levels. Such health advisories in advance would ensure people and vulnerable groups such as senior citizens, children, pregnant women among others can effectively protect themselves from deteriorating air quality, they said. Over the last two weeks, Mumbai, India's financial capital, has witnessed its highest-ever air pollution levels since city-wide intensive air monitoring was initiated in 2015. Mumbai's AQI breached the 500 mark on 24-25 January and again witnessed very high AQI (over 300) during the first week of February. This was attributed to two dust storms that originated in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan and surrounding regions that had brought dust and haze to northwestern Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. /These incidences, however, cannot be dismissed as one-off events affecting the city's air pollution, since poor air quality and its impact on health has become a significant concern for Mumbai not just during the winter months, but throughout the year, said a letter by environmentalist Sumaira Abdul Ali written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Environment minister Aditya Thackeray. ""The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has in its latest budget announced the installation of 128 sensor-based systems to monitor air quality and provide real-time data within 4 sq km each, making Mumbai's air quality network the largest in India. This will make forecasting and also issuing health warnings on poor air quality days a lot easier now,"" she has pointed out.Mumbai is one of Maharashtra's 18 non-attainment cities. A non-attainment city is one that does not fulfil the Union Environment Ministry's stipulated air quality requirements. Transportation, which accounts for 30.5 % of the city's air pollution (making it the city's most dominant source of pollution), industries and power industry (18%), domestic burning (15%), and windblown pollutants (15%), which includes the significant impact of construction dust, are among the contributing causes.""Public Health Warnings are mandated by the National Clean Air Action Plan (NCAP). They are to be implemented by every local body of the 132 non-attainment cities on days when air quality severely deteriorates and is unhealthy for citizens. The design for forecasting AQI and issuing health warnings will lead to increased public awareness and ultimately, a decrease in health risk,""she said  In another letter shot to BMC chief Iqbal Chahal Abdulali said health advisories for poor air pollution are an effective tool used across the world. ""It is critical that they are hyperlocal in nature, to best inform users about days and times when they should avoid outdoor activities such as walking, cycling, or other exercises, as well as prevent people with breathing problems and small children from playing outside in their specific neighbourhood,"" she added. Air pollution is well documented to have negative effects on not just respiratory organs but also the brain and reproductive systems in several studies. According to research by the Ministry of Earth Sciences, locations with poor air quality and greater PM 2.5 emissions are more likely to suffer Covid-19 infections and fatalities. The national average loss in lifespan due to PM 2.5 in Maharashtra was four years, another study found. In Mumbai, PM2.5 exposure reduced life expectancy by 3.7 years city-wide.""The BMC, with strong outreach to citizens through multiple dispersal sources can use its social media platforms, and can make it mandatory for radio channels, cinema halls, shopping malls, and other places where large crowds gather to prominently display the AQI levels of Mumbai. A Public Health Warning would greatly benefit all citizens of Mumbai who suffer from air pollution related health hazards and would demonstrate the BMC and Government's commitment to safeguard health in line with stated aspirations to achieve Climate-40."" she stated at the end.

"We are tenants on this planet, don't expect to eradicate Covid","As the so-called third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic - fuelled by the new mutant of the Sars-Cov2-virus Omicron - surges on, there's an air of confusion, fear and callousness, all at once. We are entering into the third year of the pandemic, and both, the public policy and the public response to the successive waves have been knee-jerk at best, haphazard at worse.Let's accept it. Covid is going nowhere and newer variants of the novel coronavirus are waiting to unlock themselves and consume us in their wake.The thought of living in this world without the novel coronavirus or its many variants and the talk of eradicating the virus and winning a war against it, is to my mind, rank foolish. It's akin to a tenant trying to evict the powerful and talented owner of his house. The earlier we realize it, the better it is for us.What can we do, both in mid to long-run?/ Based on our experiences and research all over the world, we could begin with decentralization or de-crowding of major cities. Encourage home-working patterns, which we have rightly begun, and bring about lifestyle modifications for physical well-being, which includes cleanliness at personal and collective levels.Viruses have been on our planet for as long as the planet has been in the universe. They own the earth, have been through the many vagaries, mutated, evolved and survived.Factor this: If we lay, end to end, all the 1  X  1031 viruses on the earth, they would stretch for 100 million light years. For example, some viable bacteria extracted from amber were estimated to be 34,000-1,70,000 years old. The bacterium 'Clostridium botulinum' produces a toxin so potent that 400 grams would be enough to kill everyone on the planet. There are 100 million times as many bacteria in the oceans (13  X  1028) as there are stars in the known universe. The rate of viral infection in the oceans stands at 1 X 1023 infections per second, and these infections remove 20-40% of all bacterial cells each day. From single-celled organisms to human populations, viruses affect all life on earth, often determining what will survive. The human beings - on the other hand - are in a miniscule proportion. It would be better to plan, prepare and tweak our own ways of living, and learn to co-exist with micro-organisms. There's no going back to the pre-pandemic normalcy. The new normal means we radically alter the way we have built our societies.The word 'virus' has roots in Latin for 'poison'. A 'Nature' survey shows scientists expect the virus that causes Covid-19 to become endemic, but it could pose less danger over time.To put in the wise words of Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist with the University of Minnesota, US: ""Eradicating this virus right now from the world is a lot like trying to plan the construction of a stepping-stone pathway to the Moon. It's unrealistic.""The future will depend heavily on the type of immunity people acquire through infection or vaccination and how the virus evolves.A possible surprise to physicians, and perhaps to the evolutionary biologists as well, is that most known viruses are persistent and innocuous, not pathogenic. They take up residence in cells, where they may remain dormant for long periods or take advantage of the cells' replication apparatus to reproduce at a slow and steady rate. These viruses have developed many clever ways to avoid detection by the host immune system- essentially every step in the immune process can be altered or controlled by various genes found in one virus or anotherA vaccine or a drug won't kill a virus or bacteria; they will enable us to get better immunity. With the kind of development model we have chosen to tread on, we will continue to pay a heavy price with environmental degradation and ecological destruction. Viruses are better at adapting to the changes in the earth systems than us. There are a couple of things that need urgent attention and a sustainable solution: amongst others, our population density.In the developing world, the population has increased exponentially, though it has begun to stabilize only now. This has led to high population densities. What do I mean by this? From rural to urban, migrations are going on unabated, leading to a very high density of population in some centres leading to high vulnerabilities to waves of infections. One cannot stay in a bubble. Once a person gets infected in a locality, chances are that it would spread wildly in no time.Population density and wind were major factors and explained 94% of the variance in virus spread, according to most recent studies. Air temperature, humidity, sunny days and air pollution did not affect the number of cases. Besides population density, wind speed mediated the (9%) the number of Covid-19 cases.What's more, the density of population was found to be a potential indicator of infection spread, which suggests that in such areas stringent policies - social spacing or distancing - will need to be considered more vigorously. Add a growing vulnerable population, and you get a devastating effect of so-called developing nation. The increasing share of older persons in the population is poised to become one of the most significant social transformations of the 21st century.It's therefore important to think about spreading thin - de-crowd ourselves and reverse the unbridled concentration of humans that has been our development pattern.Is it doable? I think it is, for that's a better option and the only one in the long run. Covid has taught us better ways of doing our businesses, for instance work-from-home, with improved telecommunication. Transactions are happening, while people are meeting virtually. So, it's possible for important establishments, offices, etc, based out of the high-density metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata or Bengaluru to move to the peripheral areas, even hinterlands.Viruses are smart. They are like robots or guided missiles. You look at a guided missile or look at drones - they are not alive but they can be programmed to go and hover over a place, they are empowered with limited energy, they cannot multiply among themselves so it doesn't happen that a female drone marries a male drone and another drone is produced. But they can invade your privacy. They can invade your industry and use that industry for their benefit. Almost same is true of viruses. They come with limited energy and have limited life span. They have full knowledge of how human body works, they use our own infrastructure, they use our cells, biological processes, to reproduce themselves at the cost of human bodies.Scientific predictions indicate that if we do not stop this anthropogenic war against the earth and her species, in a hundred years we will have destroyed the very conditions that allowed humans to evolve and survive. So, it for us to realize that if we must survive as a race, we better behave as tenants of the Earth accepting the fact that her owners are wiser, more powerful and bigger enemies to even think of fighting. Going back to a more scattered and decentralized societies is the long-term solution in our interest, to limit the impact of the future attacks of unknown viruses. It would also bring down the vulnerabilities of the older citizens with comorbidities like diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, or lung ailments.It calls for a correction in the path we have chosen over the past centuries, and alter that path - both economic and ecological - for a more sustainable and decentralized living.(The author is Professor emeritus IGGMC, Nagpur, Adjunct professor of practice (Mechanical Engineering).

"Mumbai: After two weeks of pleasant weather, air quality drops to poor","MUMBAI: After two weeks of pleasant weather, a combination of humidity, low wind speed, and rise in temperature has pushed Mumbai's overall air quality into the 'poor' (AQI 225) zone yet again. Two successive dust storms that hit the Mumbai coast in the last week of January and the first week of February had made Mumbai's air virtually unbreathable with the air quality index touching over a record above 500 mark, the worst-level quality count for particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration in air that exists today. Vehicular pollution, dust pollution, smoke from garbage burning, and industries hang in the air in the absence of wind speed, less humidity, and reasonably colder temperature making the wind unhealthy for Mumbaikars. /Mazgaon, BKC, Chembur, Andheri, Malad, Navi Mumbai witnessed the poor quality on the higher side.Mumbai is one of Maharashtra's 18 non-attainment cities.

Felling city's lungs will hit human lungs,"To cut or not to cut? Amid the growing row over proposed felling of heritage trees at Ajni Vann for an inter-modal station (IMS), experts from various fields have come together to make the masses aware of the repercussions that the destruction of this urban forest will cause. While doctors have warned of a rise in health ailments, specifically respiratory problems, environment experts assert that felling thousands of age-old trees will prove to be catastrophic and will lead to air pollution, global warming, soil erosion and a climate crisisNagpur: Over 40,000 citizens and various NGOs have joined hands to oppose the proposed felling of thousands of age-old trees at Ajni for construction of an inter-modal station.In a press conference held on Friday, medical and environment experts presented various facts and evidences indicating towards the irregularities and violation of norms that loom over the project.Highlighting that environmental clearances and other compliances were not taken for the project, experts stated that the economic cost of trees that are to be felled will be much higher than the financial benefits of the project. ""These trees have been sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide for almost 40-50 years,"" they said.Clarifying that they are not against the project and that it is a matter of pride that IMS is coming in Nagpur, the experts on the panel said that development should be sustainable. /""We are willing to sit with the policy-makers and find sustainable solutions. This campaign is not against development but the location where it is coming. People who are saying that Ajni is not an urban forest or that other alternatives are not available are either misleading the public or are not well-informed,"" added experts. Recently, a group of trade and industries associations held a press conference asserting that IMS should come at Ajni for the sake of city's economic growth and development. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari also said that IMS will be limited to 40-47 hectares land along the railway line. Earlier, Gadkari had stated that his ministry would drop the IMS project if citizens did not want it. He also said that the contractor had already cancelled the project and sent a termination letter to NHAI due to legal tangles. While the case is sub-judice, the objection letters filed by citizens against tree felling have been submitted to the newly-formed state tree authority. The committee has asked NHAI, which is the proposer of the project, to submit a detailed analysis of alternate sites that were explored.During his recent city visit, state environment minster Aaditya Thackeray made an unscheduled halt at Ajni Vann after green crusaders presented him memorandums. The minister assured to find a way to ensure that the IMS comes in Nagpur along with the city's Ajni Vann being protected and remaining green. While interacting with TOI, Thackeray had said wherever trees could be saved, efforts must be made to save them, especially for green patches like Ajni Vann.Green crusaders say it loud and clearDevelopment should not happen at the cost of human health. Trees play a very crucial role when it comes to protecting public health, especially our lungs. Last year during the pandemic, Union minister Nitin Gadkari inaugurated oxygen plant in the city. What we need to realize is that these plants are set up using natural oxygen. There is no point in destroying natural sources of oxygen and creating artificial ones. The large-scale destruction of trees will also lead to air pollution which will result in various respiratory ailments, lung diseases etc. I know so many families based in polluted cities like New Delhi are now shifting to cities like Nagpur and Pune for better quality of air. But if we keep destroying our green cover like this, a time will come when our city would also get highly polluted.Dr Vasant Khalatkar | paediatrician & neonatologistThe city saw numerous deaths during the pandemic due to lack of oxygen. That time, saplings were distributed and citizens were encouraged to plant trees. On one hand, the government talks of plantations and on the other hand, it plans for such massive deforestation. Ajni is one of the biggest green pockets and has age-old trees which are the biggest source of natural oxygen. These trees are protecting us from harmful UV rays and maintaining air, water and soil balance. If these trees are felled, the water will turn turbid and this will give rise to vector-borne diseases. The deforestation will also lead to other health issues like asthma, bronchitis, lungs cancer and other ailments. Also, it has been scientifically proven that trees are stress-busters and boost mental health.Dr Harsha Chhangani | dental surgeonOur survey revealed that there are about 82 species at Ajni Vann, out of which 54 are native. Some species are also rare and a lot of trees are heritage. This aside, a tree cannot be perceived as a single entity - it controls air and noise pollution, maintains groundwater level, prevents soil erosion and is a habitat of biodiversity. Ajni Vann is home to various birds and animals. So, the question is not just about felling trees but destroying a complete ecosystem. Nagpur is already reeling under the effect of climate change, temperatures are rising and monsoon patterns are changing. We cannot afford losing this urban forest.Prachi Mahurkar | tree expert, member of city's tree committeeWe have never been against the inter-modal station (IMS) project. And we are not environment mafias or anti-development and have no vested interest in opposing the project. All we are saying is we need to protect environment and urban health. And for those who argue that Ajni is not an urban forest, we would like to say that the definition of it as per the Forest Survey of India is a cover which includes more than 1 hectare and have tree canopy density of 10%. The definition further states that these patches of trees play a significant role in socio-economic and ecological status of economy. For our minister's dream project, we cannot lose this urban forest. Our only demand is to shift it to an alternate location.Anasuya Kale Chhabrani | president of swacch associationThere have been various contentions about the project area and its phases. We have now come out with all the evidence to prove how policy-makers have been misleading public. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the Railway Land Development Authority (RLDA) and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) clearly states that the project is planned over 446 acres land. Also, while some trade associations recently denied the project having any commercial phases, the MoU as well as internal presentations of NHAI show that the next phases are to be commercial, comprising of shopping complexes, offices, hotels etc. The master plan of the actual IMS project was kept hidden from the public.Wasudev Mishra | rti activistWhile authorities are claiming that most of the trees that will be felled at Ajni Vann are of subabul, the ground reality is that only 10-15% of the trees belong to this specie. Authorities should also note that subabul and babul are two different species; the latter is native to our region and is very useful. While subabul was introduced by the government as a fast-growing specie for fodder, later research proved that it contains toxins and is now banned as a fodder specie for livestock. Nevertheless, subabul trees contribute to release of oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide and are also seen adapted by local fauna as a habitat. There is no truth in the fact that subabul trees have no ecological value.Madhuri Kanetkar | tree expertTrade associations recently stated that IMS will generate employment in the city. Same dream was shown a few decades back when Mihan was introduced, promising lakhs of jobs. Where do we stand now? IMS is meant for travellers, mostly changing from one mode of transport to another. It makes no sense to destroy our natural heritage, without assessing the environmental impacts of the project. IMS should come in the outskirts of the city seeing future expansion, reducing congestion and increasing the effectiveness of Metro rail. These are the basic principles of urban planning.Sandeep Pathe | architectural conservationistThe government is fooling the public by making tall promises of compensatory plantations and transplantation. Recently, Union minister Nitin Gadkari cited example of translocation of trees done at Dwarka in New Delhi. We have personally seen the site and have clear evidence to show that the transplantation has been a big failure. The trees are dying a slow death. The poor survival rate of NHAI's compensatory plantation is obvious anywhere in the city. Lakhs of such plantations have failed to survive. Also, the amended Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act of 1975 Act states that the total number of trees that need to be felled for a project should be revealed, rather than taking permissions phase-wise. The authorities have violated this rule.Sharad Paliwal | secretary, swacch associationInitially, NHAI misled us by stating that 1,940 trees will be cut for the project. Later, a joint survey by Nagpur Municipal Corporation and NHAI revealed that the number is more than 6,000. The actual number of trees that will be felled if the project comes as per the planned phases will be around 40,000. This loss will be irreversible. We, as citizens, have the right to voice our discontentment in a democratic way based on facts. By accusing and hurling personal abuses at citizens, using uncouth language and targeting us for raising our voices against destruction is a new low visible in the relationship of people and government. This city is our home and we have the constitutional rights to present true facts to the public which are being hidden by policy-makers.

Staff urged to shun own vehicles on Wednesdays,"Madurai: Madurai district collector S Aneesh Sekhar has urged officials and staff across ranks from all the government departments that are functioning under the district administration to avoid using personal vehicles that run on fossil fuels such as petrol and diesel while coming to work on Wednesdays, in a bid to set an example in reducing air pollution. /""Though it is a small step, it will be the start to protect the environment,"" the collector said. /In a statement, he stated that the officials and staffs could use the public transport, could go on foot, use bicycles or electric cycles or vehicles to come to office on that day. He advised the officials to urge visitors coming to their respective offices to also follow the same./This step to go green on Wednesdays is following the example set by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) that has announced Wednesdays as Travel Day, wherein all their staffs, including contract should to refrain from using personal vehicles that run on petrol or diesel. This was one of the measures by the TNPCB to reduce pollution and improve air quality./The collector pointed out that smoke generated by vehicles running on fossil fuels account for 72% of the total air pollution in cities and that according to the World Health Organisation report in 2005 around 20 lakh people die annually due to air pollution. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, sulphur dioxide and carbon dust released from vehicles operating on fuels could even cause cancer and damage the lungs./While welcoming the decision, officials in the collectorate were sceptical of the level of compliance. Citing practical difficulties that include necessity to travel from their offices for field inspections for which they have to go from their offices, they said that this could affect their compliance./ For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
No survey on air pollution by cement plants: Govt,"Shimla: Issue of pollution caused by cement plants and its harmful impacts on crop and human health was raised in the state Assembly by Congress MLA from Arki, Sanjay Awasthi. He said that several cement plants are operating in Arki Assembly constituency, but no survey has been carried by the government to assess its harmful effect on the population living in the vicinity of these plants while people are suffering with respiratory problems./Awasthi had asked a question about the air quality around cement plants and whether any assessment on the impact of air pollution caused by cement plants in the surrounding villages was doine in last three years./In reply, government informed that no survey has been done to check the air pollution impact on the villages surrounding the cement plants. But the air quality is monitored by the state pollution control board./The Congress MLA said that many people living in the villages located near the cement plants are suffering with respiratory problems and have developed lungs disease. He said that first cement in his constituency was established in 1992 and in last 30 years, no survey has been done to check its adverse impact especially with regard to human health and crops./While replying on behalf of chief minister, urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj said that pollution control board monitors the air quality and takes action on finding any irregularities on the part of cement plants. He said that air quality of villages are also checked from time to time./He said that NGT had also constituted an expert committee after the residents of Rauri village of Darlaghat area in Arki tehsil of Solan district of Himachal Pradesh filed an application./ For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Explained: How do different types of air purifiers work and why do you need one for your home,"A report published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 2021 stated that indoor air pollution is about two to five times worse than outdoor pollution. This means that indoor air can contain up to five times more pollutants like mould, pesticides and particulates compared to the air outdoors. The air inside your rooms may also have allergens like dust, pet dander and pollen. It is a practical and healthy choice to get a device that removes these pollutants and allergens. /An air purifier is a perfect device for the situation. As we have to spend more time indoors for the Covid-19 pandemic it is better to respire fresher air while you are inside your house. Here we will discuss how air purifiers work and why are they useful?What is an air purifier?An air purifier is an indoor device that traps and filters harmful particles and eventually releases fresh and cleaner air. These devices can restrict the spread of harmful particles and allergens to prevent respiratory diseases or allergies. The device can be used in offices, homes, learning centres, and hospitals to purify the air in these spaces. How do different types of air purifiers work?There are four different types of air purifiers that are available in the market which includes -- HEPA filter, Activated Carbon Filter, Ionizer, UV Light. Here we discuss how each type of air purifier works:HEPA filter air purifier -- An air purifier with HEPA filters suck air into the device and passes it through the filter using the internal fans. As they pass through the filter, airborne contaminants get trapped inside the dense materials and clean air flows out of the other side. A HEPA filter can capture fine pollutants as tiny as 0.3 microns in size, including dust, pollen, mould, and some bacteria. This makes it the most popular filter among all. Activated Carbon air purifier -- An air purifier that uses an activated carbon filter works the same way as a HEPA filter air purifier does. These air purifiers also pull air through the filter to trap pollutants and allergens. The primary difference between these two types of purifiers is the materials used in the filter. Activated carbon is a specially treated material that has high porosity and can absorb pollutants as air passes through it.Ioniser air purifier -- An ionizer air purifier does not use any filters to clean the air around. These air purifiers emit negatively charged ions that combine with the airborne particles to make them denser. The denser particles get too heavy to move freely in the air and fall onto the ground or other surfaces. The drawback of these types of air purifiers is that the contaminants still exist inside the room until you clean them up.UV light air purifiers -- Air purifiers that come with the Ultraviolet (UV) feature use short-wave UV-C light to destroy airborne germs like bacteria and viruses. It uses a method of disinfection called Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI). In this method, as air is forced through the device it passes the UV lamp that directly tries to disinfect the air.Importance of air purifiers Everyone needs clean indoor air and those who are suffering from allergies and respiratory problems such as asthma have enough reasons to buy one. Improved air quality inside frequently used spaces like -- offices, homes, schools and even the car can help to reduce allergy and asthma triggers.Moreover, modern buildings are designed to be more energy-efficient and they are usually sealed to comply with the requirements. In such cases, the airflow circulation is compromised and pollutants can be trapped inside the house. Air purifiers can also work as artificial ventilation for modern homes.Some buildings are also exposed to various pollutants starting from vehicle exhaust, construction contaminants, fresh paints among others. Air purifiers can filter all these harmful particles from your indoor air if you are residing in such buildings. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Study reveals Bhandewadi residents breathing toxic air 24X7,"Nagpur: Over 1 lakh citizens living near Bhandewadi dumping ground are breathing toxic air 24X7. They do not get to breathe clean air even for a single hour throughout the day.These revelations have come to the fore in a two-month-long air quality monitoring study conducted by city NGO Centre for Sustainable Development (CFSD). Highlighting that the dumping ground has been substantially contaminating the air putting human lives at risk, the study found that the average daily concentration of the deadly particulate matter (PM) 2.5 was 115.63 micrograms per cubic meter (mpcm), which is twice as high as the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) prescribed standards of 60 mpcm and almost eight times higher than the safe limit of the World Health Organization (WHO). These recordings were recorded at two monitors installed at Bhandewadi dump yard gate and Vaishnodevi Nagar layout, located 1.5 km away.During the same period, the average PM2.5 levels as recorded by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) monitoring station at Civil Lines located 10 km away, was 43.48 mpcm.PM 2.5 is over 30 times smaller than a human hair in size and has the ability to travel through human lungs and cause multiple health ailments. ""The extremely high PM 2.5 levels are found to be linked with burning activities at the Bhandewadi dump yard. /The data also revealed that people at both locations were breathing polluted air for 24 hours a day. During our monitoring period we were also able to shed light on the dangerously high levels of PM 2.5 concentration that people are exposed to while having to resort to creating bonfires to keep warm during the winter season,"" said Sakshi Rajabhoj from Asar, an environmental research and communications think tank. Rajabhoj did the independent assessment of analysis of PM2.5 data.Stating that the health of local residents is at stake, CFSD founder Leena Buddhe said that the residents of nearby colonies complained of burning activities taking place inside the dump yard. ""We were informed that the smoke produced leads to breathing discomfort and other respiratory ailments, especially among the kids and the elderly people. Since there are no air monitoring stations in this area, we undertook this two-month-long air quality monitoring exercise,"" said Buddhe.Jyoti Waghmare, who is residing in Vaishnodevi Nagar Layout for 16 years, said that the locals are now tired of complaining. ""During rainy season the stench of decaying garbage fills the area making it difficult to even sit in the house and eat food. In summer and winter, the smoke from burning garbage creates huge health concerns and most people suffer from cough or other respiratory issues,"" she said.Stressing that most of the disease burden is borne by low and middle-income groups and marginalized communities living around highly polluted places, interventional pulmonologist Dr Sameer Arbat said, ""In children and adults, both short and long-term exposure to PM2.5 from the Bhandewadi dumpsite can lead to reduced lung function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma. Maternal exposure is associated with adverse birth outcomes, such as low birth weight, pre-term birth and small gestational age births. Emerging evidence also suggests ambient air pollution may affect diabetes and neurological development in children.""Dr Arbat added the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) should take this matter seriously and devise plans to minimise air pollution using effective methods. On Monday, a copy of the report was submitted to the NMC commissioner Radkhakrishnan B by CFSD. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
How India Lost Nearly A Third Of Solar Power Potential To Foul Air,"New Delhi: Air pollution is not just taking a toll on health but also holding India back from achieving its solar energy goals, says a study carried out by Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. It says the country lost 29% of its utilisable 'global horizontal irradiance potential', or the radiation that generates solar power, due to air pollution between 2001 and 2018. This gap in harnessing potential solar energy is equivalent to an annual loss of $245-835 million.IIT considered both the 'soiling effect', or presence of solid dust, and 'atmospheric attenuation', or the scattering of light due to gaseous pollutants in the air, to assess pollution. The study asserts that India could have generated more clean energy and relied less on fossil fuels for power had it met its clean air targets. /As it is, the study says, urban haze caused an 11.5% loss in solar radiation falling on a surface in Delhi during 2016-17, causing a loss of about $20 million. ""Successful implementation of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) and complete mitigation of household emissions through the supply of cleaner fuel for domestic use and rural electrification would allow India to generate a surplus electricity of 6-16 TWh (terawatt hour) per year from the existing solar power installed capacity in 2018. This translates to an economic benefit of $325-845 million annually,"" says the study entitled 'Cleaner air would enhance India's annual solar energy production by 6-28 TWh' written by Dr Sagnik Dey, Dilip Ganguly, Somnath Baidya Roy and others from the Centre for Atmospheric Science, IIT-D. To achieve its goal, the study urges for the ""successful implementation"" of three government programmes: Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) and Deen Dayal Upadhyay Grameen Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) for reducing household emission, and NCAP to tackle ambient air pollution. The study asserts that PMUY and DDUGJY can generate a surplus of 3-8 TWh per year, worth $163-425, while meeting the NCAP target would generate another 3-8 TWh per year. The study pointed out that the combined benefits from these three policies were worth $325-845 million, or almost the equivalent of the budget allocation of $1,100 million for PMUY and $42.6 million for the first two years of NCAP.It also estimates the potential benefits of India meeting WHO's guidelines on clean air of 10 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic metres at a surplus of 10-28 TWh per year, resulting in incremental revenue of $505-1,425 million annually. The study also said that generation of this surplus energy would be more pronounced in the eastern and north-eastern power grids because the population in those regions relied extensively on fossil fuel and biomass burning for day-to-day activities.

Air quality below WHO norms in 41% Haryana districts,"CHANDIGARH : How polluted is the air that people of Haryana are breathing can be gauged from the fact that the air quality in nearly 41% of the districts exceeds the World Health Organization's (WHO) air quality standard in 2021.The PM2. 5 concentration levels in these districts have been found higher in the range of over 17 times to nearly six times above the WHO annual air quality guideline value of 5 micrograms per cubic meter.The worrying fact has come to the fore in the latest World Air Quality Report, prepared by Swiss organisation IQAir. As many as nine districts feature in the unwanted list of the top 50 most polluted cities.With PM2. 5 value pegged at 89, Hisar was listed at 11th spot where the air quality was over 17 times above the fixed limits. In Faridabad, the most populous place in Haryana had PM2. 5 value of 88. 9 -about 17 times above the fixed limit-and was placed at 12th spot in the list followed by Rohtak (86. 9) at 14th, Jind (84. 1) at 17th, Gurugram (83. 4) at 18th, Yamunanagar (73. 3) at 37th, Sonipat (68. 7) at 42nd, Kurukshetra (68. 1) at 43rd and Ambala (65. 3) at 50th place. /Ludhiana, the industrial hub of Punjab, was the lone district from the state to be on the list by attaining the 41st spot with PM2. 5 recorded at 71. 8. Air pollution is considered by experts as one of the greatest environmental risks to health. They have been for long stressing upon for bringing the levels of air pollution under control which can help in reducing the burden of several diseases such as lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, acute respiratory diseases, including asthma.The report observed that about 20% to 35% of total urban PM2. 5 concentrations in the country is directly or indirectly due to vehicular emissions. Annual vehicle sales in the country are expected to increase, with an estimated number touching 10. 5 million by 2030. It stated: ""In an effort to curtail the contribution to air pollution from vehicles, India has adopted rigorous vehicle emission standards for new vehicles.

Mumbaikars breathe nine times worse air than WHO's prescribed limits,"MUMBAI: The air people breathe in Mumbai is almost nine times worse than the healthy levels recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO), reveals a recent report by IQAir, a Swiss group that measures air quality based on the concentration of carcinogenic PM2.5 in the air. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region also has one of its suburbs among the most polluted regional areas in south-central asia.The PM2.5 concentration in Mumbai has not only gone up in 2021 to 46.4 g/m3 or micro-gram/cubic metre) over the 2020 average off 41.3 g/m3 or micro-gram/cubic metre but also has one of its distant suburbs -- Bhiwandi -- at the top of the most polluted regional cities in the entire central and south asia, reveals the report. Bhiwandi has shown its PM 2.5 concentration at 106.2 g/m3, horrible over 20 times the WHO limit for living beings.It may be mentioned here that last year, the WHO changed its prescribed limit for safer PM2.5 level in air from earlier 10ug/m3 to now 5ug/m3. Counrty's annual average PM2.5 levels have already reached 58.1 g/m3 in 2021, ending a three-year trend of improving air quality. /India's annual PM2.5 averages have now returned to pre-quarantine concentrations measured in 2019, the report said.According to the report India was home to 11 of the 15 most polluted cities in Central and South Asia in 2021. Delhi saw a 14.6% increase in PM2.5 concentrations in 2021 with levels rising to 96.4 g/m3 from 84 g/m3 in 2020. No cities in India met the WHO air quality guideline of 5 g/m3 . In 2021, 48% of India's cities exceeded 50 g/m3 , or more than 10 times the WHO guideline.""Air pollution has a massive impact on human health in India. It is the second biggest risk factor for disease, and the economic cost of air pollution is estimated to exceed $150 billion dollars annually. Major sources of air pollution in India include vehicular emissions, power generation, industrial waste, biomass combustion for cooking, the construction sector, and episodic events like crop burning,"" the report stated. In 2019, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) enacted the National Clean Air Program (NCAP). The plan seeks to reduce PM concentrations by 20% to 30% by 2024 in all identified non-attainment cities, increase air quality monitoring, and implement a city, regional, and state-specific clean air action plan as well as conduct source apportionment studies. ""However, the lockdowns, restrictions, and resulting economic downturn due to the Covid-19 pandemic have made it difficult to determine the plan's impact based on air pollution levels alone. A recent report found that apart from city-specific action plans, no other plans have been formulated under NCAP prescribed timelines,"" the report added.Additionally, there is little information about the activities related to the NCAP, making it difficult to dispel the public's dissatisfaction with the slow progress under the program. It is estimated that 20% to 35% of total urban PM2.5 concentrations is directly or indirectly due to internal combustion engines in motor vehicles. Annual vehicle sales in India are expected to increase, with an estimated fleet number reaching 10.5 million in 2030.42 In an effort to curtail the contribution to air pollution from motor vehicles, India has adopted rigorous vehicle emission standards for new vehicles. The BS-VI standard in India is currently equivalent to the Euro 6-1 standard and will be equivalent to the Euro 6-2 standard beginning in April 2023. Emissions testing methodologies capable of measuring emissions under real world driving conditions, rather than more simple laboratory driven cycles, are in development at the International Centre for Automotive Technology in India with an anticipated release of 2023, the report pointed out.

Track the pollution level in your city,"2 years on, IIT-Kanpur's plan to better Jaipur's air awaits execution","JAIPUR: To relieve the city from increasing air pollution, IIT-Kanpur had prepared an action plan to bring it under control after conducting a study in the city in January 2020. But even after two years, the state government has failed to implement it on ground. As a result, Jaipur was ranked at the 70th spot in the IQAir's world's most polluted city in 2021. IQAir, a Swiss air quality technology company had released its study last week.Doctors are also worried over the high level of concentration of particulate matter (PM2. 5) in city's airas they believe that this phenomenon will eventually lead to more health issues among the people. Dr Ankit Bansal, consultant pulmonologist at a private hospital said that people will be more predisposed to lung ailments including asthma.""Those patients who already are asthmatic and have COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) have a tendency of worsening their symptoms. Due to this, their medication doses will also be increased,"" said Dr Bansal. /He added that apart from the gradual increase in air pollution, there is also an increase in the number of cases due to the existing seasonal change and pollinating season. ""The worsening of air quality will only add to the problem in such patients,"" he said.Doctors have appealed to the state government to take strict measures to bring down the air pollution.The action plan IIT, Kanpur has suggested that if the state government takes measures to prevent air pollution by focusing on major causes and sources of air pollution, such as hotel and restaurants, domestic sector (biomass burning), municipal solid water burning, construction and demolition, road dust, vehicles, industrial and generator sets, decongestion of roads at high traffic areas, it may help in improving the air quality. A Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) official said that during the lockdown due to Covid, the air pollution had reduced significantly as sources of air pollution were reduced noticeably.The report by IIT, Kanpur states, ""Sindhi camp central Bus stand causes extreme congestion and increased emissions and should be decongested at priority. It is recommended that the city should have three larger inter-district/inter-state bus stations in north-west (towards Sikar and Bikaner), east (towards BharatpurAgra) and south (towards Tonk). ""It also recommended shifting the private bus stands, currently, near Sindhi camp, Polo victory and nearby areas, to other locations. The report recommended adding more metro railway lines for rapid public transport systems to discourage the use of personalized vehicles and preventing traffic congestions.The action plan recommended strict parking policy in congested areas, by making high parking cost at city centres and only parking should be limited for specially abled people.The IIT, Kanpur had also identified Badi Chaupad, BSNL CSC circle, Chomu Pulia, D-Circle, Collectorate Circle, Gopalpura Circle and Gandhi Circle as the main bottlenecks for traffic, which needs to be resolved for smooth traffic flow.The study suggested that the focus should also be on decongestion of roads at high traffic areas. According to the action plan, strict action on road side encroachment should be taken. Disciplined public transport should be ensured, removal of free parking zones should be done, and existing framework for removing broken vehicles from roads should be examined. The government should create a system for speedy removal and ensure minimal disruption to traffic. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

However, the DSP maintained that two students received injuries, including an 8-year-old who suffered burn injuries.Punjab education minister Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer sought a report on the accident and directed government officials to provide free treatment to the injured students of Sri Guru Har Rai Public School.Gurdaspur deputy commissioner Muhammad Ishfaq said he had marked an in- quiry into the incidentFarmers have set ablaze their fields to burn stalks left from the Rabi harvest and to prepare the farmland for sowing Kharif crops, starting next month. Stubble burning is strictly prohibited and attracts heavy penalties as it is known to be a primary source of air pollution in northern India, which experiences days of dense smog from farm fires around autumn when farmers prepare for their Rabi crops. But the practice still continues. Wheat buying crosses 100 LMT A day before grain markets start closing for procurement in Punjab, 87,150 MT wheat arrived in the mandis on Wednesday, taking total arrival and procurement to over the psychological 100-lakh-MT mark. Wheat arrivals were recorded at 100.78 lakh MT on May 4, while procurement had reached 100.72 lakh MT.Also, 83.9 lakh MT wheat was lifted by the evening, which took the lifting figures to 83.3%.

Women labour against odds as pollution poses grave health risks,"New Delhi: Construction worker Draupadi has had a liver condition for eight years. Though her doctor advised her to stop working because dust is a major reason for her deteriorating health, the 43-year-old knows of no other way she can earn for her family. Her husband too has skin disease that can be traced to pollution, but they are hired intermittent and must make the most of all opportunities to work.""I have laboured at construction sites for nearly two decade and I don't know any other work,"" Draupadi, a mother of two, told TOI. /""We are now aware of air pollution and its impact on our health, so we ask the contractors to sprinkle water on the dust."" Draupadi was among the women construction workers at an event organised by Mahila Housing Trust (MHT) and Help Delhi Breathe campaign on problems faced by such labourers and the co-creation of solutions with the government and other stakeholders.According to WIEGO, or Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing, construction labourers comprise the biggest worker group in Delhi at 7% of total employed. All construction workers, but women especially, are vulnerable to air pollution and climate change. The event drew attention to the high levels of air pollution at construction sites that caused lung, skin and heart diseases. Savki, who works at a construction site near Tikri border, said the constant exposure to dust from 9am to 6pm has caused her cough and breathing problems. Her problem doesn't end with going home. As Poonam from Gokulpuri pointed out, ""An LPG cylinder costs Rs 1,000 and my mother-in-law asked me to use the chulha to save money. Now we are exposed to indoor pollution as well."" No wonder Sunita desired the government to organise health camps for them.MHT has trained 50 women as 'AQI ambassadors' to make the rounds of slum clusters and construction areas to raise awareness about air pollution. These women, mostly construction workers, have learnt how to use portable AQI monitors to keep track pollution in their communities and work sites.Lakshmi, an AQI ambassador, said the AQI reading at construction sites is mostly an unhealthy 350-400. ""We show the reading to workers and educate them about the impact of pollution on their health. We advise them to wear masks and gloves, sprinkle water on dust and cover all construction material,"" said Lakshmi. Bijal Brahmbhatt, director, MHT, said, ""In September last year, we launched this project to provide scientific understanding of air pollution issue and trained AQI ambassadors from Sawda Ghevra, Bakkarwala and Gokulpuri. The 50 women trained 1,700 others and in the past nine months, they have together educated nearly one lakh construction workers about pollution."" Reena Gupta, advisor, environment department, Delhi government, will submit the women's suggestions given at the event to the government. ""The state government has issued a 14-point guideline to control dust pollution at all construction sites,"" said Gupta. ""The workers should ask the site supervisor not to flout these rules and report any pollution-related problem using the Green Delhi app.""  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"'At 2.4 million in 2019, India led world in pollution deaths'","NEW DELHI: Pollution led to over 2.3 million (23 lakh) premature deaths in India in 2019, accounting for over a fourth of the nine million such fatalities worldwide, an update to The Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health published in The Lancet Planetary Health said. Economic losses from modern forms of pollution - including ambient air and toxic chemical -now amount to at least 1% of the country's GDP, it addedWhile ambient air pollution alone may have led to nearly 1.7 million deaths in India in 2019, fatalities attributed to traditional sources of pollution - indoor air and water - have dropped to less than half of the number in 2000.The report underlines that India continued to account for the world's largest estimated pollution-related deaths in 2019 - ahead of China with nearly 2.2 million deaths - while the amount of pollution remains well above WHO guidelines in 93% of the country despite government's efforts to contain household pollution and substantial investments in monitoring and planning to support pollution reduction efforts.Globally, there were nine million deaths attributable to pollution in 2019, same as in 2015. Ambient air pollution accounted for nearly 75% of all deaths, with fatalities in China the highest at 1.8 million. More than 1.8 million deaths globally are now caused by toxic chemical pollution (including lead), an increase of 66% since 2000, the update shows.The new report also states that although the number of deaths from pollution sources associated with extreme poverty (such as indoor air pollution and water pollution) have decreased, these reductions are offset by increased deaths attributable to industrial pollution (such as ambient air pollution and chemical pollution).Pollution remains the world's largest environmental risk factor for disease and premature death, especially affecting low- and middle-income countries.The new report is an update of the last report The Lancet Commission on pollution and health published in 2017 that addressed the devastating health impact and economic costs of air, water, and soil pollution on humankind and the planet.For the update, instead of repeating global calculations, the study evaluated the cost of modern pollution on a subset of countries' prospects for economic growth and societal development. /Six countries or regions were chosen: India and China, which are the two most populous countries globally; Nigeria and Ethiopia, which are the two most populous countries in Africa; the USA, which has the world's largest economy; and EU, which is a large economic entity with common pollution standards across member states.""Economic losses due to modern forms of pollution have increased as a proportion of GDP between 2000 and 2019 in India, China, and Nigeria, and are now conservatively estimated to amount to approximately 1% of GDP in each of these countries. The full economic losses, if the full health impacts of pollution were to be counted and the effects of pollution on informal sectors and environmental damage were to be fully detailed, are likely to be greater,"" the update report says.The report also underlines that China and India, countries with massive pollution challenges, have been making substantial investments in monitoring and planning to support pollution reduction efforts.""India has developed instruments and regulatory powers to mitigate pollution sources but there is no centralised system to drive pollution control efforts and achieve substantial improvements. In 93% of India, the amount of pollution remains well above WHO guidelines. International organisations have supported various databases to monitor air quality,"" it says.

Mumbai witnesses high air pollution than Delhi on Thursday,"MUMBAI: Almost after three months when the repeated dust storms from northwest had severely polluted the quality of air Mumbaikars breathe, Thursday saw the city's average air quality once again plunging into very poor category, even beyond Delhi, Ahmedabad and Pune. Delhi is considered as country's most polluted city. While Mumbai's average AQI was 309 on Thursday, Delhi (191), Pune (276) and Ahmedabad (297) showed relatively lower AQI. /(See graphic). In fact Delhi fared better than Pune, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad. This is clear indication for Mumbaikars to avoid heavy exertion at least during next two says especially those who have respiratory and related health issues.Among city's suburbs, except worli and Navi Mumbai which showed the moderate AQI level, rest all the suburbs such as Bhandup, Malad, Mazagon, Chembur, Borivali, Andheri showed 'very poor' air quality. However, Colaba remained within 'poor' mark but on its higher side. (See graphic).According to Gufran Beig, SAFAR's programme director, though the wind with dust from Thar region is constantly flowing into city, it is unable to cross the high moisture or humid wall (known as low pressure area) along Mumbai that has been created due to high temperature in the northern hemisphere and pre-monsoon weather in southern parts. Thus the combination of high moisture and humidity has forced the city's rising smoke and dust to hang in the air, taking Mumbai's overall air quality index (AQI) into 'very poor' (309)zone. AQI is based on the concentration of carcinogenic particulate matter (PM2.5) in air.According to the forecast by SAFAR, AQI of Mumbai indicates the 'very poor' and likely to be within 'very Poor' for the next 2 days.Two successive dust storms that had hit Mumbai coast in the last week of January and first week of February this year had made Mumbai's air virtually unbreathable with air quality index touching dangerously over a 500 mark, the worst-level quality count ever for human beings to breathe. Vehicular pollution, dust pollution, smoke from garbage burning and industries mainly contribute to the pollution in Mumbai. Conversion of all vehicles to greener fuels, power generation entirely through greener modes and pollution-free garbage disposal will be the solutions to reach net-zero pollution goals which according to experts still look like a distant dream.

"Need surveillance platform for health and environment, says Kalpana Balakrishnan","More than 27 crore children in the country have high levels of lead in their blood, lowering their intelligence besides their cognitive function, says Chennai-based Kalpana Balakrishnan of Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, who coauthored the recent Lancet Commission on pollution and health. In an interview with Pushpa Narayan, she talks about the obstacles to bring down pollution in the country and the ways to overcome them.The recently-published Lancet study shows that pollution led to more than 2.3 million premature deaths in the country in 2019. Did these outcomes come as a surprise?Pollution has been responsible for nine million premature deaths in 2015. It was the largest environmental risk factor for disease and premature death. Deaths from pollution risk factors, the unintended consequence of industrialisation and urbanisation, have risen by 7% since 2015 and by more than 66% since 2000. In India, more than 23.5 lakh Indians died prematurely due to pollution in 2019. This was the highest globally. /At least 16.7 lakh deaths were caused due to air pollution. Burning of biomass in households was the single largest cause of air pollution deaths in India, followed by coal combustion and crop burning. The results aren't surprising, but it is sobering. Despite all the actions being taken at the global and national levels, the health risks from environmental exposures continue to be alarmingly high.Do you think enough effort has been made to check health impact of pollution? If not, what and where are the barriers to progress?The biggest barrier is inadequate exposure surveillance. Just like health surveillance that monitors, estimates and manages communicable and non-communicable diseases, we need good quality surveillance of environmental pollution in the country. This requires substantial investments in technical and human resources. We must build significant capacities for implementing and monitoring the efficacy of interventions through sound surveillance systems, and progress toward clean, healthy environments.What would be your recommendation to the government? Do you think environmental impact studies can be combined with existing health surveys?Why not? In India, we need an integrated surveillance platform for health and environmental exposures. This could include biological and environmental monitoring regimens for priority pollutants as part of the routine National Family Health Survey. It will provide strategic information on environmental health risk attributions alongside other risk factors, to reduce the burden of maternal and child health impacts as well as NCDs.These surveys may take a while to show results. Is there any outcome that you think the government must act upon immediately?Levels of lead in blood here are unacceptable. Nearly 27.5 crore children have levels higher than 5g/dL. This is a concern because these children are likely to score 3 to 5 points lower in intelligence tests than children with lower lead concentrations in their blood. Higher lead concentrations are also associated with loss of cognitive function. Fifteen leadrelated IQ losses are associated with increased rates of school failure, behavioural disorders and diminished economic productivity. This is one of the most important issues. We must accelerate a complete transition to the use of clean cooking fuels for all rural communities. We have enough evidence to show the benefits of eliminating solid cooking fuel, besides improving household and ambient air pollution. The study also shows reduction in deaths attributable to the types of pollution associated with extreme poverty such as household air pollution and water pollution.Yes. The decline in deaths from traditional pollution caused by using solid fuels and unsafe water has been due to significant improvements in water supply, sanitation, treatments and cleaner fuels that have made measurable inroads in mortality statistics. But much of this gain has been offset by increased risks from modern forms of pollution including ambient air pollution and exposure to toxic chemicals. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"City's air more dangerous for infants, toddlers","Ahmedabad: City's air pollution is emerging as a big threat to children's health. In a first-of-its-kind study on children below the age of six, researchers collated data from a public hospital to show how infants and toddlers suffer more than adults when exposed to particulate matter pollution (PM 2.5). /The 18-month-long study found that of the 12,635 paediatric admissions, 2,682 children below six years of age - almost 21% - had reported respiratory disorders and infections due to air pollution. /The study was led by Dr Khyati Kakkad of AMC Medical Education Trust Medical College and LG hospital along with Chirantap Oza. /Joining them were Priya Dutta from IIPH-Gandhinagar, Varsha Chorsiya from School of Physiotherapy, Delhi University, and Prashant Rajput from Public Health Foundation of India, Gurugram. /The study found that around 30.6% of the 2,682 children were exposed to tobacco smoke. /Another 74.83% lived at a distance of less than 500 metres from the main road, thus exposing them to vehicle fumes; around 11.59% of children were affected by indoor air pollution. /Around 25% of the children were from economically weaker sections and lived in kutcha houses. /Of these, the homes of 20% of the children had only one window. /Out of 2,682 respiratory admissions, 1612 (60.1%) were experiencing ""wheezing disorders"" while 1,070 (39.9%) were diagnosed with ""non-wheezing disorders""./ The study noted, ""Infants and young children have less compliant lungs, a larger proportion of small airways, weaker chest wall and less immature immune system. These make them more vulnerable to respiratory diseases."" Another interesting fact that emerged from the study was according to WHO recommendation, young infants or toddlers must not be exposed to particulate pollution levels of PM 2.5 exceeding 15 micrograms per cubic metre. /However, the annual average PM2.5 concentration in Ahmedabad was 80.27 micrograms per cubic metre. / For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Bhopal #1 in tongue cancer among women: ICMR data,"BHOPAL: At a time when urban populations are struggling with air pollution and its impact on health, Bhopal -which has cleaner air - still ranks high on the cancer chart due to chewing and smoking tobacco.Bhopal has the highest incidence of tongue cancer among women in the country -4. 1 per lakh. In cancer of the mouth among men, the Madhya Pradesh capital is second -15. 9 per lakh. This data is from the latest findings of the ICMR-National Cancer Registry Programme. /Tuesday was World No Tobacco Day. As a percentage, cancer of the mouth, tongue and lungs account for nearly six in ten cancer cases in Bhopal. Chewing and smoking tobacco is the primary cause of the ailments, said state cancer nodal officer, Dr Atul Shrivastava.More recent data -delayed due to the pandemic - is being compiled, said officials, adding that it will provide a deeper analysis of the effect of the ban on tobacco-mixed gutka.The current data -compiled in 'Report of Cancer sites Associated with Tobacco Use in India: Findings from the National Can- cer Registry Programme' --is updated till May 2021. Generated by ICMR and National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP), this information is critical for cancer surveillance and control.Consumption of tobacco is a causal factor of at least 25 diseases of which cancer, coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive lung disease are the major ones. The incidence is calculated on an age-adjusted rate.The Bhopal part of the report is mostly based on analysis of population and hospital-based registry sites, which includes Gandhi Medical College (GMC).Since 2005, long-term impact of cancer on the gas affected population is missing in the reportsThe MP state capital has a significant gas-affected population from the 1984 tragedy.Interestingly, since 2005, long-term impact of cancer on the gas af- fected population is missing in the reports. ICMR and associated agencies have not been able to establish a sizable recall rate for impact assessment of cancer and the world's worst industrial disaster of 1984.

Civic body to prepare Ahmedabad's largest air pollution inventory,"Ahmedabad: Every day in Ahmedabad, one can easily spot plumes of smoke rising from factory chimneys. The dust kicked up by overloaded trucks, exhaust from lakhs of vehicles, and the smouldering Pirana dump only adds that extra dash of toxic air that we and our children breathe every day. To properly assess the city's emissions and even predict pollution levels a few days in advance, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) is setting up the city's largest emission inventory./This will include calculating emissions based on vehicle counts at junctions and arterial routes, from industry clusters and small and micro-enterprises as well as household kitchens in the city. The project will be part of the Air Action Plan for Control of Air Pollution in Ahmedabad (APCAPA). Under this, AMC will commission the largest study to collate data repositories of emission sources in Ahmedabad. The civic body will appoint an agency for collating data of source apportionment of particulate matter pollution, carrying capacity, and emission inventory for the city. The emission inventory data is needed to prepare mathematical models for pollution predictions in the future. In short, it will entail the prediction of pollution levels for specific areas for a few days in advance. The last such study in the city was carried out by IITM Pune in 2016. The project was conducted by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) under the central ministry of earth sciences in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH) Gandhinagar. IITM had identified and collated total emissions from 81, 217 sources in the city./Under the study profile of ground-level concentration (GLC) of air pollutants in different parts of the city along with air sheds of the city including residential, commercial, mixed areas, and source-specific hotspots will be made in residential, commercial and industrial zones. For the study, a minimum of 12 air monitoring stations will be installed at locations such as kerbside, residential, industrial and background areas of the city. The selected agency will carry out continuous monitoring for one month in each season for three seasons covering the whole year plus five days of Diwali festivities. AMC has invited expressions of interest from agencies. / For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution peril: Amdavadis 'smoked' 2.5 cigarettes/day in 1 year,"AHMEDABAD: You may be a non-smoker but exposure to ambient air pollution in Ahmedabad may have turned you into a passive smoker taking in pollution equivalent to two-and-a-half cigarettes daily. This is equivalent of a citizen finishing a pack of 10 cigarettes in four days straight and in two days on bad air days.A group of environmental engineering course alumni run the Twitter handle @GujaratAQIBot wherein, based on data available in public domain - primarily through Indian Institute of Meteorology, Pune, and Central Pollution Control Board - a bot converts the air pollution in the unit of cigarettes smoked daily./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/ '22 micrograms = 1 cigarette'  Rudradutt Thaker, an alumnus of Global Centre for Environment and Energy from AhdUni, who is pursuing higher studies in atmospheric and oceanic sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the initiative was started and run by his senior Sagar Rathod, a PhD candidate.""The calculations are based on the principle that about 22 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter is equivalent to one cigarette. It's an idea used globally to give a perspective on the extent of air pollution and its impact on health,"" said Thaker. The analysis shows a major disparity between areas of Ahmedabad.

Track the pollution level in your city,Air pollution in Lucknow worse than pre-pandemic levels,"LUCKNOW: The city's air quality has worsened drastically once again and so much so that it has even surpassed the high pollution levels recorded in the pre-Covid times. The hazardous PM 2.5 concentration in the pre-monsoon season has increased by 43.9% as compared to last year. Moreover, the PM 2.5 concentration levels were 10% more than in 2019. Indiranagar and Charbagh were the areas with the most polluted air in the city. /These figures were revealed in the report titled 'Assessment of Ambient Air Quality of Lucknow city: Pre-Monsoon 2022', released by the CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research on Saturday, the eve of World Environment Day. The report shows the average concentration of deadly pollutant this pre-monsoon was 92.8 micrograms, far above permissible limit of 60 micrograms, and higher than 84.3 micrograms recorded in pre-Covid times in 2019 when industrial, commercial, and other activities were in full swing like this year.IITR chief scientist GC Kisku, who led the air monitoring survey, attributed the rise to increase in construction activities and vehicular load that led to traffic snarls, fuel combustion and road dust dispersion. Open garbage and municipal solid waste burning and weather conditions due to less rain are the main reasons for this pollution spike, he added. The situation is even more alarming since PM2.5 concentrations were recorded above the permissible limits in all the nine localities - four residential and commercial each, and one industrial monitored by IITR. In residential areas, Indiranagar was the most polluted with the highest PM2.5 concentration followed by Aliganj, Gomtinagar and Vikasnagar, while in commercial areas Charbagh was the most polluted followed by Chowk, Alambagh and Aminabad. ""The vehicles on the road have increased by 5.4% as compared to last year and the consumption of CNG gas has gone up by 157.98%. Petrol consumption has also increased by 4.43%,"" said Kisku. He said CNG vehicles like taxis have increased by 34.9% while Omni buses have increased by 11.9%. Fuel combustion is one of the main reasons behind the increase in PM2.5 concentration, he added. The increase in air pollution levels can take a toll on human health as studies have found that PM2.5 penetrates deep into lungs, corrodes the alveolar wall and consequently impairs lung function. Further studies in toxicology and related fields have revealed that the pollutant has increased human mortality rate and diseases. Air pollution has led to a decrease in average life span from months to a few years, he added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Fourth wave not yet seen on horizon: Top ICMR official,"PUNE: Covid-19 upticks in some districts should not be interpreted as statewide phenomena, Dr Samiran Panda, additional director-general of Indian Council of Medical Research, said on Saturday.Dr Panda's comments come shortly after the Centre issued a note of caution to five states - Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana, Karnataka and Maharashtra - that are recording Covid spikes in some of their districts.He told TOI that the current number of cases nationwide, and their patterns, do not suggest a new wave is forming. ""A fourth wave has not been seen on the horizon yet,"" he said, adding that increases in few districts of the five states do not mean the states in their entirety are facing big surges. He called for closer analysis by local administrations to prevent further rise.The ICMR expert said health officials in areas seeing spikes should emphasise the importance of masks to protect against various respiratory tract infections and even air pollution. /Officials could engage with citizens via community organisations to ensure such advisories translate into action, he said. 4th wave not yet on horizon: ICMR expertDr Panda said, ""States should examine test performance and test positivity and ensure adherence to preventive public health measures.""

'Air pollution may cut 7.6 years of life expectancy of 40% of Indians',"NEW DELHI: Most of the world breathes unsafe air, taking more than two years off global life expectancy, while the air pollution shortens average life expectancy in India, the second most polluted country in the world after Bangladesh, by five years, relative to what it would be if the new stringent WHO guidelines were met, said the new Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) analysis released on Tuesday. It also said the pollution would cut 7.6 years of life expectancy of 40% of Indians who live in the Indo-Gangetic plains. The report analysing AQLI, released by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), noted that air pollution is the greatest threat to human health in India in terms of life expectancy, reducing it to by five years whereas child and maternal malnutrition reduces average life expectancy by about 1.8 years, while smoking reduces the average life expectancy by 1.5 years. As per AQLI, in the Indo-Gangetic plains of northern India, 510 million residents, nearly 40% of the country's population, are on track to lose 7.6 years of life expectancy on average if current pollution levels persist. /In the case of Delhi, the world's most polluted capital, people would lose 10 years of their lives in a business-as-usual scenario of not adhering to the new WHO standards.Analysing the data till 2020, the EPIC report said about 44% of the world's increase in pollution has come from India since 2013, and noted that the air pollution continued to increase in South Asia - the most affected region of the world - during the first year of the pandemic despite Covid-19 lockdowns. Since 1998, India's average annual particulate pollution (PM2.5) has increased by 61.4%, and currently, it stands as the world's second most polluted country. In 2019, over 7 million deaths annually were linked to exposure of various pollutants in the world with analysts claiming that around 80% of deaths attributed to PM2.5 exposure. Among all classical air pollutants, inhalable PM2.5 is considered the most hazardous as it gets deposited in lungs through breathing and causes serious respiratory problems. The WHO had last year cut its guideline for annual exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in half, from 10 g/m3 to just 5 g/m3, bringing most of the world - over 97% of the global population - into the unsafe zone. The EPIC's AQLI converts air pollution concentrations into their impact on life expectancy, noting that the impact of air pollution on life expectancy is comparable to that of smoking, more than three times that of alcohol use and unsafe water, six times that of HIV/AIDS, and 89 times that of conflict and terrorism.Referring to the new stringent benchmark, the EPIC report said the entire Indian population live in areas where the annual average particulate pollution level exceeds the WHO guideline. ""More than 63% of the population live in areas that exceed the country's own national air quality standard of 40 g/m3,"" it said while noting that Indians would have gained 1.6 years if its national standards were met.""By updating the AQLI with the new WHO guideline based on the latest science, we have a better grasp on the true cost we are paying to breathe polluted air. Now that our understanding of pollution's impact on human health has improved, there is a stronger case for governments to prioritize it as an urgent policy issue,"" says AQLI director hrista Hasenkopf.The AQLI also illustrates how air pollution policies can increase life expectancy when they meet the WHO guideline for what is considered a safe level of exposure, existing national air quality standards, or user-defined air quality levels. ""This information can help to inform local communities and policymakers about the importance of air pollution policies in concrete terms,"" said the report. As far as India is concerned, the government had in 2019 launched its National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) with a goal to reduce particulate pollution by 20-30%, relative to 2017 levels, by 2024. The NCAP targets are non-binding. ""However, if India were to achieve and sustain this reduction, it would lead to remarkable health improvements. According to the AQLI, a permanent, nationwide reduction of 25%, the midpoint of NCAP's target range, would increase India's average national life expectancy by 1.4 years, and by 2.6 years for residents of the national capital territory of Delhi,"" said the report.

Indians losing 5 years of life due to air pollution: Study,"NEW DELHI: Air pollution shortens average life expectancy in India, the second most polluted country in the world after Bangladesh, by five years, relative to what it would be if the new stringent WHO norms were met, according to a new Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) analysis released on Tuesday. In fact, pollution would cut 7. 6 years of life expectancy of 40% of Indians who live in the IndoGangetic plains, says the the report released by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC).While most of the world breathes unsafe air shaving off two years off global life expectancy, the report noted that air pollution is the greatest threat to human health in India, reducing life expectancy by five years whereas child and maternal malnutrition reduces it by about 1. 8 years and smoking reduces by an average 1. 5 years.As per AQLI, in the IndoGangetic plains of northern India, 510 million residents, nearly 40% of India's population, are on track to lose 7. 6 years of life expectancy on average if current pollution levels persist.

"How Bad Air, Weather Adding To Outdoor Workers' Burden","New Delhi: A new study says that poor air quality and extreme weather events increase the burden on the health of outdoor workers in Delhi. The lack of effective mitigation measures and policies, lengthy working hours and varied work locations aggravate the workers' exposure to air pollution.The study conducted by Indian Institute of Technology, Tirupati, TERI School of Advanced Sciences, University College of Medical Sciences and AIIMS surveyed 283 autorickshaw drivers, sweepers and street vendors, who are all exposed to the city's poor air quality and the effects of extreme weather during peak summer and winter.According to the study, autorickshaw drivers (47%), street vendors (47%), and sweepers (48%) felt air pollution had a significant effect on their health. The autorickshaw drivers had the highest incidence of ophthalmic symptoms, such as eye redness (44%) and eye irritation (36%), while the vendors had the highest frequency of headaches (43%) and eye redness (36%). ""This can be ascribed to increased exposure to vehicular pollutants during working hours,"" explained professor Suresh Jain, corresponding author, IIT-Tirupati.Jain added, ""Delhi's geographic location renders it particularly vulnerable to air pollution events such as smog and it has harsh weather conditions both in summer and winter. /Outdoor workers are among the hardest hurt in such scenarios.""The lung function test results revealed that 39% of the sweepers, 33% of the auto drivers and 27% of the street hawkers had limited lung function. ""This is linked to conditions like systemic inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial lung disease. Further analysis revealed a link between pulmonary function deterioration and smoking and age. The odds ratio showed that smokers had an almost four-fold increased risk of acquiring lung disease,"" said Jain.The corresponding author added that sweepers had a higher rate of lung impairment than the other occupational groups due to the nature of their work involving frequent exposure to dust and particulate matter.And yet, only 4% of the sweeper responders said they wore gloves at work. Similarly, only 2% of auto drivers avoided heavily polluted routes. ""These workers claimed that due to their socioeconomic circumstances, they were unable to stay away from work for long periods when air pollution was high or weather was harsh,"" revealed Jain.During the study period, the highest summer temperature in Delhi saw a high of 47 degrees Celsius with day temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius on most days. The minimum in winter ranged between 4 and 18 degrees Celsius. ""Most respondents reported headaches, dizziness, nausea and muscular cramps during excessive heat,"" said Jain.The study found a sharp drop in worker productivity during pollution and extreme weather events. ""We concluded that while personal habits and influencing variables such as age, smoking, tobacco use, pre-existing health disorders and a lack of usage of acceptable safety measures might raise these workers' sensitivity to occupational health risks, a lack of proper pollution mitigation measures and policies, long working hours and varying work locations exacerbate their health conditions,"" said Jain.The report suggested that the government authorities and occupational welfare organisations could create awareness and promote the use of safety measures such as respiratory masks, goggles and protective clothing. It said local, national and global mitigation policies and preventive guidelines should be formulated to benefit such workers. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Better AQI index can increase lifespans in Jharkhand, says report","RANCHI: Improvement in air quality index (AQI), particularly in terms of reducing the PM2.5 level can improve the life expectancy in all 24 districts of Jharkhand. A study conducted by the Energy Policy Institute, University of Chicago (EPIC), has found that by adhering to World Health Organisation (WHO) prescribed standards of PM2.5 concentration, the average life expectancy of a person can be improved by 6.8 years in Dhanbad and 5.4 years in Ranchi.Director communications of EPIC India Ashirvad Raha told TOI that they have been working on Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) to explain pollution levels in terms of life expectancy, which is easily interpretable and draws attention of everyone - from commoners to experts. ""AQLI links research work with satellite data of PM2.5 concentration and plot life expectancy graph as every 10 micro gram per metre cube increase in PM2.5 concentration reduced life expectancy by 0.64 years,"" he said. /The WHO puts the PM2.5 limit at 5 micro gram per metre cube while India puts it at 40 micro gram per metre cube.The idea of corelating historical research data with satellite observation of pollutants is further useful in case of states like Jharkhand which lacks real-time monitoring of ambient air quality. ""It becomes difficult to obtain real-time data from across the state as there are only two real-time monitors located in Ranchi and Dhanbad. However, our AQLI tool can estimate the levels in even remote parts of the state,"" he added.Dhanbad-based cardiologist Dr D Chattejee admitted that the smaller particles of pollutants - PM2.5 are more dangerous as they pass into the blood stream and go to the deepest parts of the lungs. ""We have started the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), 2016, in 102 most polluted cities of the country. But there is a need for awareness at the individual level,"" he said. Burning of garbage and plastic waste results in release of particulate matters, he cautioned.Another Dhanbad-based pulmonologist Dr Suprova Chakravorty said she has come across a patient of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) who comes from a well-to-do family and was not exposed to industrial pollution. ""Four people in the family had similar complaint. We understood that the food being cooked on firewood at their home led to domestic air pollution, indicating that cooking medium can also cause COPD,"" she added.

'Install electric ovens to curb air pollution',"Panaji: The Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) on Friday decided that bakery units within the city limits can shift to electric ovens or install air pollution control devices (APCD) within two years, whereas the same rule will not be applicable to traditional bakeries in rural areas.Member secretary of the board, Shamila Monteiro informed GSPCB members that bakery units engaged in production of bakery products with a capacity of less than 1 metric tonne (MT) per day and using wood fired ovens are categorised as traditional bakeries. Some of these bakeries are operating in residential areas within city limits. Due to the presence of high-rise buildings and apartments, smoke emitted from the wood fired ovens gets obstructed and which then enters residences causing nuisance and smoke pollution.She also informed the board that it was not possible for the bakeries to raise the height of smoke stack. She also said that the central pollution control board has categorised bakery units as under, ""Bakery units having less than 1MT/day production capacity using electric/gas ovens under green category, and bakery units with greater than 1MT/day production capacity using wood fired ovens under orange category.""

What's cooking? Bid to tackle sources of indoor pollution,"New Delhi: Unrecognised and unaddressed so far, the pollution agencies have finally focused on indoor air pollution, especially in slums and low-income households in Delhi-NCR caused by the use of wood, coal or other polluting cooking methods.Seeking recognition of indoor air pollution under the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, so it can be monitored, the Commission for Air Quality Management has suggested a slew of measures to address it in its new policy for Delhi-NCR. CAQM says the indoor pollution due to widespread use of solid fuels is responsible for many deaths and for 25-30% of outdoor air pollution. Its report points out that while schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana and similar state government initiatives have expanded, they are still yet to reach the masses. /CAQM's new policy document, released on Wednesday, says, ""In Delhi, for instance, LPG penetration has increased after the implementation of 'Kerosene Free City' scheme in the last decade. District- and ward-wise data is not yet available to assess the gap in NCR. Though the official data shows legal LPG coverage of households in Delhi and NCR states near 100%, there are issues of supply, use of mixed fuels by households and delayed refill that push households to fall back on dirty fuels in the semi-urban and rural areas.""The bigger challenge was that the migrant and floating population in the low income categories and BPL households did not have access to clean fuels. The recommendation is to have a strategy for providing such groups with cleaner energy options like PNG or LPG while preventing the unorganised sector from using unauthorised fuel in Delhi-NCR. CAQM also wants a halt to coal burning either by colony ironing services and tandoors and provision of solar cookers to BPL families or connection of all households with gas pipelines. Commenting on the new focus, Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy) Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""Chulhas burning solid fuel leads to indoor pollution exposure and smoke affects outdoor air quality. We need schemes to give the poor households and migrant workers LPG. Schemes like Ujjwala have expanded but we need to do more in rural and peri-urban areas.""She added that air pollution action had traditionally focused on outdoor sources, but ""we now have to recognise that public health is being hugely impacted by indoor pollutants based on the household energy and this hadn't got the attention it warranted.""

Dizziness indoors? Blame it on plastic pollution,"AHMEDABAD: Say air pollution and the first thing that pops up in mind is vehicular fumes from petrol or diesel, or smoke emanating from power plants. It may then come as a surprise that innocent looking goods of daily use such as plastic containers, cosmetics, cooking oil, deodorants, floor disinfectants and mosquito repellents in your home are also causing air pollution.Several chemical-based consumer goods like cosmetics, disinfectants and cooking oil among others emanate volatile organic compounds (VOC). These, according to a pilot study carried out in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar homes - one of the first in India to carry out comprehensive assessment of indoor pollution sources over the time of day and seasons - can cause health hazards. The VOCs don't need heating, burning or cooking to emanate and can trigger symptoms like watering of eyes, irritation in upper respiratory tract, headache or dizziness, nausea and headache.Health experts say that symptoms are often labelled 'Sick Building Syndrome.' These, on the extreme end of the spectrum, can also cause cancer, said experts.A pilot study carried out by a team of scientists from Indian Institute of Technology-Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn) and American universities in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar homes attempted to find sources of indoor pollutants in one of the first comprehensive assessments of VOCs in India and found no less than 69 compounds prevalent in the homes. /The paper 'A Pilot Study to Quantify Volatile Organic Compounds and Their Sources Inside and Outside Homes in Urban India in Summer and Winter during Normal Daily Activities' was published recently in a MDPI journal 'Environments.'Its authors include Christina L Norris, Ross Edwards, Chinmay Ghoroi, James J Schauer, Marilyn Black, and Michael H Bergin from Duke University, University of Wisconsin at Madison, IIT-Gn and Underwriters Laboratories (UL) Inc. The project was sponsored by UL.The study found no less than 69 compounds prevalent at home. The most common VOCs identified included acetaldehyde, formaldehyde and variants of pentamethyl heptane.The study took into consideration two seasons (summer and winter) and different times of the day (morning and evening) of 26 homes. Total indoor VOCs were measured at higher concentrations in winter (327.0  224.2 micrograms per cubic meter of air) than summer (150.1  121.0 micrograms per cubic meter of air) and exceeded those measured outdoors,' mentioned the paper, indicating that the VOC concentration in indoors was higher than the one measured outdoors.The study also pointed at plastic materials as a major source of VOC - in May, about 42% of the VOCs were from plastics due to increase in temperature compared to January when it just contributed 4%. Indoor cooking and consumer products accounted for about 29% and 10% of the VOCs in January, compared to 16% and 4% in May. In terms of outdoor pollution, 84% of the VOCs were from vehicular sources.Dr. Ghoroi, professor of chemical engineering at IIT-Gn, said that VOCs have well-known health hazards ranging from short-term problems such as mild irritation of mucous membrane to long-term health issues such as chronic respiratory problems and cancer. ""In the context of climate change and continuous temperature rise, increased off-gassing generates more VOCs and increases the threat of more health hazards, especially in indoor environments,"" he said, adding that the data would help understand VOCs in Indian context as there are only a few studies done in the field.Dr Bergin, professor of Civil & Environmental Engineering at Duke University, during his visit to IIT-Gn had said that while summers are marked by pollutants entering the home from open windows, in the winter it's opposite with the doors and windows closed, building the pollutant concentration. ""Our objective is to probe this difference to get an actual estimate of the indoor air pollutants,"" he had said.The team said that long-term aim of the project is to create awareness about source of indoor air pollutants and find ways to minimize itCity-based pulmonologists said that air pollutants often cause irritation and in extreme cases respiratory issues in the patients.

Rain forces down the most common air pollutants, like particulate matter and pollen down. Thereby, the quality of air becomes drastically better. /Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, the increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage, among others./PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. /Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases./ For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
How to have a smooth recovery after lung cancer surgery,"Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Lung cancer occurs when cells multiply abnormally in the lungs and form a malignant tumour. In India, lung cancer accounts for 5.9% of all cancers and 8.1% of all cancer-related deaths. /In 2020, there were more than 2.2 million new cancer cases worldwide. While in India, approximately 81,200 cases were diagnosed with lung cancer.Smoker or non-smoker, lung cancer can still hit youICMR researchers report that lung cancer cases are likely to rise seven-fold by 2025 compared to a decade ago due to a lack of population-level screening tools. In nearly 45% of lung cancer cases, cancer has spread to other parts of the body by the time it is diagnosed.While the prevalence of smoking in patients with lung cancer is nearly 80% however the concern non-smokers can also not be immune to lung cancer due to growing air pollution. August 1 is observed as World Lung Cancer Day. Dr Jyoti Wadhwa, senior director of Medical Oncology at a Gurgaon hospital says: ""Lung cancer is common cancer affecting both men and women. It is of different types and hence the treatment needs to be tailored as per a given patient's subtype and stage to achieve the best possible outcome.""How are the patients treated?""A multidisciplinary team approach is followed to make the best treatment plan for a given case. Surgery, radiotherapy and medical treatments of various types have helped improve the treatment outcomes. Effective medical treatments in the form of targeted therapy, immunotherapy and chemotherapy add to a patient's quantity and quality of life.""With improvements in personalized treatment of lung cancer, early-stage patients get cured and those with even stage 4 cancer are living much longer and better. So there is a lot of hope in terms of lung cancer prevention and treatment in the year 2022,"" says Dr Wadhwa.The path to a smooth recoveryDr (Col) P Suresh, senior consultant, Medical Oncology says that lung cancer patients often have a difficult time returning home after surgery. ""Lobectomy is a common lung cancer surgery in which it removes one of the lobes from the lungs. After the surgery, healthy tissues of the body make up for the missing lobe, so the lungs work well. It is a major surgery which takes time to heal.""One can experience pain, shortness of breath, dry cough and fatigue post-surgery. To speed up recovery, follow your doctor's instructions regarding medication, activity, driving, and incision care, says Dr Suresh.""Usually, patients find themselves being more emotional while recovering, but it is natural, as recovering from cancer surgery is huge. That can be dealt with by keeping a journal or making an appointment to see a cancer psychologist.In addition to getting lots of rest after surgery, your doctor may recommend some level of aerobic exercise every day to prevent deconditioning. Even walking for a short distance can reduce the risk of blood clots and keep your heart healthy. It is normal to feel short of breath at first, so start slowly and build up gradually,"" adds Dr Suresh. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
7 anti-smog guns to check dust in Faridabad,"GURUGRAM: To curb air pollution in winter, the municipal corporation of Faridabad (MCF) plans to deploy five small and two big anti-smog guns. The two big guns will be set up on trucks and used to cover any part of the city, while the small guns will get installed in and around some crowded places and government buildings.Every winter, air pollution in Delhi-NCR touches hazardous levels because of a combination of adverse meteorological factors and local emission sources such as construction and demolition waste, road dust, waste burning in the open, vehicular emissions and smoke from stubble burning. An anti-smog gun sprinkles water within at least a 20m radius and helps to control dust pollution. /A big machine covers a radius of 50 metres. Each small machine costs nearly Rs 35 lakh, while the bigger one costs nearly Rs 1.5 to 1 crore.""All the formalities for obtaining the seven guns have been completed. We have issued a work order in this regard to a company, which will make them available within a month,"" said a senior MCF official.One of the anti-smog guns will be at the corporation headquarters at BK Chowk. BK Chowk is also home to BK Hospital and the post office, along with other offices and residences of officers.Faridabad is the only district in Haryana on the non-attainment cities' list of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). A non-attainment city is one whose air did not meet the national ambient air quality standards of 2011-2015.

Cleaner tech gives Punjab industry annual benefit of Rs 750 crore,"CHANDIGARH: The adoption of green technologies is proving to be a boon for enterprises in Punjab on two fronts - helping them achieve sustained economic benefits and contributing to emissions reduction. If the data of the Punjab State Council for Science and Technology (PSCST) is to be believed, the cleaner technologies introduced in the industry helped generate an economic benefit of Rs 750 crore per annum.PSCST has supported shifting of 1,600 industrial units to green technologies in past five years. The sectors which have opted for cleaner ways of functioning include brick kilns, induction units, rolling mills, forging units, rice shellers, foundry sector and galvanizing units.The adoption of environment friendly technology has helped in bringing down the greenhouse gases by 33.38 lakh tonne per annum and reduction of suspended particulate matter (SPM) by 74,000 tonne per annum. /Besides impacting the climate, greenhouse gases cause respiratory disease from smog and air pollution. The units have also saved 1.23 lakh tonne per annum fuel while one lakh industrial workforce has benefited from the clean working environment. The environmentally friendly initiatives have attracted investment of Rs 450 crore in the state.One of the initiatives of PSCST includes converting natural-draft brick kilns into induced-draft with rectangular and zigzag setting. PSCST executive director Jatinder Kaur Arora shared that they had facilitated shifting of about 1,000 brick kilns in the state to non-polluting technology. There are about 2,800 brick kilns in the state, producing around 15-20 billion bricks per annum, accounting for nearly 8% of total production in the country.Arora said the council had successfully conducted trials in a few brick kilns for use of paddy straw pellets (8-12mm) in inducing draft kilns as partial replacement of coal. Utilisation potential per kiln has been recorded at 200-400 tonne per annum. In view of present coal prices, paddy straw pellets are an economical option as fuel for which more pellet manufacturing units are required, she stated.The council with support of Punjab Pollution Control Board has succeeded in setting up demonstration units of three capacities - 50, 100 and 150 tonnes per day - for the conversion of rolling mills from coal to piped natural gas (PNG). By doing so, the council has managed mass-based automation and control system-based technology for the first time in the state. ""The technology will help in the yearly reduction of air pollution by 90% in this sector.""Successful trials have been done for use of paddy straw briquettes up to 20% replacement of conventional briquettes in stationery grate boiler while trials for the firing of paddy straw-based fuel in fluidized bed combustion (FBC) boiler are underway.Science and technology secretary Rahul Tiwari said the initiatives being taken were aimed at not only protecting the environment but also helping the industry to drive economic benefits from them.

"World's biggest cities face worst of air pollutants; Delhi, Kolkata, Shanghai and Moscow listed as most polluted in new report","NEW DELHI: Most global cities far exceed World Health Organisation's (WHO) air pollution guidelines, posing serious health risks, with Delhi and Kolkata figuring as top two most polluted cities in terms of being exposed to hazardous fine particulate matter (PM2.5) whereas Shanghai in China and Moscow in Russia figured as top two most polluted for being exposed to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), said a new report released by the US-based Health Effects Institute's (HEI) State of Global Air Initiative on Wednesday.The report, 'Air Quality and Health in Cities' that used data from 2010 to 2019, found that global patterns for exposures to the two key air pollutants are strikingly different. ""While exposures to PM2.5 pollution tend to be higher in cities located in low- and middle-income countries, exposure to nitrogen dioxide, or NO2, is high across cities in high-income as well as low- and middle-income countries,"" it said.The report, released in Boston, provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of air pollution and global health effects for more than 7,000 cities around the world, focusing on two of the most harmful pollutants - PM2.5 and NO2. In 2019, 1.7 million deaths linked to PM2.5 exposure, occurred in the 7,239 cities, with cities in Asia, Africa, and Eastern and Central Europe seeing the greatest health impacts. /Earlier reports of the HEI had found that air pollution is responsible for one in nine deaths, accounting for 6.7 million deaths worldwide in 2019, with particularly strong impacts on the young, the elderly, and those with chronic respiratory and heart diseases.Delhi, Kolkata, Kano (Nigeria), Lima (Peru), Dhaka (Bangladesh), Jakarta (Indonesia), Lagos (Nigeria), Karachi (Pakistan), Beijing (China) and Accra (Ghana) figured as the top 10 most polluted cities due to exposure to PM2.5 while Shanghai, Moscw, Tehran (Iran), St. Petersburg (Russia), Beijing (China), Cairo (Egypt), Ashgabat (Turkmenistan), Minsk (Belarus), Istanbul (Turkey) and Ho Chi Minh City (Viet Nam) are the top most polluted cities due to NO2 exposure. Beijing featured in both the top 10 lists. ""As cities around the world rapidly grow, the impacts of air pollution on residents' health are also expected to increase, underscoring the importance of early interventions to reduce exposures and protect public health,"" said Pallavi Pant, HEI senior scientist who oversaw the report's publication. Underlining that as much as 68% of the world's population is expected to live in urban areas by 2050, the report said, ""This rapid urbanization places the world's top cities at the forefront in the battle to reduce the health effects of air pollution, especially in low- and middle-income countries.""The report, however, also highlights data gaps in low- and middle-income nations, a key aspect to understanding and addressing the health effects of air pollution. According to the WHO's Air Quality Database, only 117 nations currently have ground-level monitoring systems to track PM2.5, and only 74 nations are monitoring NO2 levels. The report that combined ground-based air quality data with satellites and models to produce air quality estimates for cities around the world suggested that the strategic investments in ground-level air quality monitoring systems and expanded use of satellites and other emerging technologies in targeted regions can provide critical first steps toward cleaner air. ""Since most cities around the world have no ground-based air quality monitoring in place, estimates of particulate and gas pollution levels can be used to plan air quality management approaches that ensure the air is clean and safe to breathe,"" said Susan Anenberg of George Washington University, one of the project collaborators. NO2 comes mainly from the burning of fuels often in older vehicles, power plants, industrial facilities, and residential cooking and heating. The report noted that as city residents tend to live closer to busy roads with dense traffic, they are often exposed to higher NO2 pollution than residents of rural areas. In 2019, 86% of the more than 7,000 cities included in this report exceeded the WHO's 10 g/m3 guideline for NO2, impacting about 2.6 billion people. ""While PM2.5 pollution tends to get more attention on known hotspots around the world, less data has been available for NO2 at this global scale,"" said the report.

High PM2.5 count makes Kolkata 2nd most polluted city in world,"KOLKATA: Among the 10 most polluted cities on PM2.5 count, Kolkata globally ranks second in the State of Global Air (SOGA) Report, 2022. Kolkata has an annual average of 84g/m3 of PM2.5 concentration in the air, almost 17 times the WHO recommended safe limit of 5g/m3, says the new report published by US-based research organization Health Effects Institute (HEI). This new report - Air Quality, and Health in Cities - provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of air pollution and global health effects for more than 7,000 cities around the world, focusing on two of the most harmful pollutants - fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). /<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/Even though nitrogen pollution is not a great problem in India, PM2.5 remains the biggest concern in Indian cities.

All these cities saw an increase of more than 30g/m3 during that decade. Because of this high exposure to PM2.5 pollution, Kolkata also ranks eighth among the most populous cities in the world related to the highest PM2.5-related disease burden in 2019. Kolkata has 99 deaths for every lakh citizens exposed to such high PM2.5 pollution. Delhi is ahead of Kolkata both in terms of exposure to PM2.5 (110g/m3, which is 22 times of WHO safe limit) and the higher burden of diseases. The report, using data from 2010 to 2019, found that global patterns for exposures to the two key air pollutants are strikingly different.

Track the pollution level in your city,Battle Bad Air: Citizen's Charter Lists People's Duties In 4 Stages,"New Delhi: While anti-pollution measures under the revised Graded Response Action Plan are to be implemented from October 1 across Delhi-National Capital Region, the Commission for Air Quality Management has also introduced a citizen's charter that lists guidelines for the public to follow during different levels of pollution.In stage I, when air quality is deemed to be in the 'poor' category, people have been asked not to idle their vehicles, but to turn off the engine at traffic signals. They are also advised not to dispose of waste in open spaces. They should report activities exacerbating air pollution on the various mobile apps of government agencies.In stage II, when the air quality hovers in the 'very poor' category, people have been advised to use public transport and minimise use of personal vehicles. /They should avoid dust-generating construction activities from October to January.Similarly, the public has been requested to cut down vehicular pollution in stage III when the air quality touches the 'severe' category. CAQM has asked citizens to opt for a cleaner commute: share a ride to work or use public transport or walk or ride a bicycle. People whose responsibilities allow it should work from home.During a severe plus air crisis in stage IV, children, the elderly and those with respiratory, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or other chronic diseases should avoid outdoor activities and stay indoors as much as possible.Experts said apart from restrictive official actions, public participation of this nature was needed to fight pollution. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""The modified GRAP focuses on proactive implementation of emergency curbs based on pollution forecasts. While regulatory action has to be very stringent and systemic, peoples' action can make the implementation more effective. Voluntary action by people to cut down on unnecessary travel trips and use of personal vehicles and reduce outdoor exposures, among other steps, can strengthen support for the inconvenient and harder measures needed to prevent worsening of air pollution in winter.""Restrictive actions under stages ll, lll and lV of GRAP will be invoked at least three days in advance of the AQI reaching the stage benchmarks based on the forecast of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, and India Meteorological Department.Among such curbs are a ban on diesel generators and coal and firewood, halt to construction, and closure of brick kilns, hot-mix plants and industries running on non-cleaner fuels. The state governments may consider additional emergency measures like closure of educational institutions, suspension of non-emergency commercial activities and allowing vehicles on odd-even basis. CAQM may also determine additional measures and exceptions as per the prevalent AQI and weather forecast. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Give Me Red! Clean Air Cuts Anaemia Risk,"New Delhi: Long-term exposure to air pollution due to high PM2.5 increases the risk of anaemia in women of reproductive age, a joint research by IIT-Delhi, St John's Medical College, Bengaluru and other institutes has established.According to the researchers, until now it was the general perception that malnutrition was a major cause of anaemia. As a result, India's programme was focused on increasing the iron intake among the vulnerable.India has one of the highest global prevalence (over 53%) of anaemia among women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) from regular iron deficiency due to menstruation, diet or other factors like genetic disorders, parasitic infections and inflammation from infections and chronic diseases.The research, titled ""Reducing the burden of anaemia in Indian women of reproductive age with clean-air targets"", published in the journal ""Nature Sustainability"" stated that while currently the solution to anaemia was being explored in ""iron deficiency"", the solution may also lie in cleaner air.The study mapped the entire country, including Delhi, and found that as concentration of PM2.5 increases by 10 micrograms per cubic metre, the risk of anaemia increases by over 7.2% among women. Researchers attributed this finding to high inflammation caused due to air pollution, which further reduces the body's absorption capacity of iron. /They pointed out that merely increasing iron intake may not reduce iron deficiency as the ingested iron may not be absorbed due to inflammation caused by long-term PM2.5 exposure.Professor Sagnik Dey from Centre of Excellence for Research on Clean Air, IIT-Delhi, one of the lead authors of the study, pointed out that the Union health ministry's mission ""Anaemia Mukt Bharat"", which seeks to reduce anaemia prevalence from the current 53% to 35%, could be easily achieved if two other schemes, National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) and Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), met their target.The other lead researchers included Ekta Chaudhary from IIT-Delhi and Dr Santu Ghosh from St John's Medical College.Dey pointed out that since there were different sources of PM2.5 (biomass burning, fossil fuels, industrial and domestic emissions, etc), the impact of emissions also varied. The emission from industries, especially the unauthorised sector, had the largest impact.NCAP aims to reduce PM2.5 by 30% by 2025, while PMUY is aimed at reducing household emissions through LPG for cooking. ""If both these schemes are successfully implemented, then anaemia prevalence will come down to 39%, which is very close to the target,"" said Dey.The National Family and Health Survey 2015-2016 had reported that 53.1% of women of reproductive age and 58.5% of children under five were anaemic in India.

Health effects due to Noida twin towers demolition; here's how to be safe,"D-Day has approached! Supertech's 915-apartment Apex (32 stories) and Ceyane (29 stories) twin towers in Noida will be demolished today, August 28, at 2:30pm, as per the Supreme Court's decision. Noida's authorities are ramping up safety measures and hospitals are currently on high alert. ""We at Jaypee Hospital sector 128 Noida are completely ready for tomorrow's demolition. /We have dedicated eight emergency department beds and 12 ICU beds for tomorrow. Also, one ACLS ambulance equipped with all the necessary medications and equipment will be on standby for any mishap,"" said a statement issued by the Jaypee Hospitals, one of the places nearest to the demolition space. Doctors and health experts have warned against a five-fold increase in air pollution, which could lead to several health issues.Why is the twin towers demolition concerning?The twin towers' demolition has caused health concerns amongst people residing in the neighbourhood areas. It is likely to cause several weeks of health issues such as headache, asthma, attacks, colds, phlegm and allergies.Earlier in January 2020, following the demolition of four towers Holy Faith H20, Alpha Sirene, Jain Coral Cove and Golden Kayaloram in Kochi and Maradu in Kerala, many people experienced health problems that lasted for weeks after the incident. Reportedly, 75,000 tonnes of debris was collected from and removed due to the fall of all four towers and the air pollution in the atmosphere is said to have increased up to five times. After today's demotion of the twin towers, 2.5 lakh tonnes of debris is estimated to be removed from the area. The dust plume is expected to rise to a height of about 150 meters. Emerald Court Society and ATS Village Society will be the two areas that will reportedly be the most affected. What experts have to say?Many experts have come to the fore and not only discussed the health impact the demotion will have on the people, but also have talked about how the air pollution caused will be determined by the direction of the wind. ""How long the effect will remain it's difficult to say, but it all depends on environmental conditions as well,"" Dr Rakesh Kumar Gupta, Director of Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida said, as per reports.According to Dr Mrinal Sircar, Head Pulmonology and Critical Care, Fortis Noida, ""When you demolish a big structure like that there will be dust and there will be some smoke because you are using explosives. So, the direction of the air matters. The direction of the wind should also be taken into consideration. Demolishing like this or rather an explosion happening in the open air is much safer than, say, underground mines,"" as per another report. ""The dust and gases will get diluted in the air and will get dispersed. The experts who are involved in such big demolitions will take care of all these things,"" he adds. Health issues that can arise from the demolition The pollution that will most probably arise from the demolition is likely to cause serious health problems including:- Headache- Eyes, nose and skin irritations- Respiratory issues such as sore throat, cough, nasal congestions and runny nose- Some may also experience shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, SPO2 reductions of less than 92 percent andchest pain, in light of which you must seek medical help. - Body aches and fever may also be common- Nausea and stomach painPreventive measures to take NOW!For now, it is best for everyone to stay indoors and shut their windows. Refrain from stepping outside until extremely necessary. Wear a mask when you visit outdoors and protect your eyes with sunglasses or goggles.In case of skin or eye irritation, consult your doctor. If you're someone who has pre-existing health conditions, such as high BP, diabetes, asthma, heart diseases, watch out for symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, etc. In addition, make sure you take all your medications on time. Keep in touch with your doctors and again stay indoors. Furthermore, maintain good hand hygiene - wash your hands frequently and make sure you vacuum your house frequently as dust can accumulate on your furniture, floor, upholstery, curtains, etc.. Use the AC to avoid dispersing of the dust, clean the filter before and after the demolition. Make sure to keep yourself well-hydrated. According to the statement issued by Jaypee Hospitals, ""The administration of the hospital along with all other support staff will be available from 9 am to 6 pm to take over the responsibility. Apart from that adequate quantity of blood products have been kept in stock in our blood bank so that it can be used if required."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Winter? Why Delhi can expect to breathe easier...,"NEW DELHI: Counting the several steps readied to monitor the city's day-to-day functioning in order to lessen air pollution, experts expect a less restrictive winter for Delhiites this year. However, extreme weather events or meteorological conditions, which are now the new normal, remain worrying factors.With the new Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in place to facilitate restrictions based on AQI forecasts and IITM's decision support system (DSC) to forecast the air quality becoming functional in the next few days, and with better coordination expected between the governments of Punjab and Delhi on stubble burning, experts believe fewer air-related restrictions may be imposed in the city in winter this year./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/Air pollution in Delhi peaks around October end. On air emergency days with very high pollution, the authorities prohibit many activities, including construction and demolitions (C&D). According to a 2016 IIT-Kanpur study, C&D is the most consistent and third highest contributor to an area's particle pollution load. The study had estimated that the emission load from C&D activities in Delhi is 5,167kg per day and 1,292kg per day with respect to PM10 and PM2.5, respectively.According to Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, the air quality this winter will depend on how much pollution is controlled or prevented. ""Delhi-NCR has a new plan this year, but it will require specific sectoral strategy and planning in advance,"" she said. ""The implementation, therefore, will define the effectiveness of the new policy which will further define this year's winter. In any case, there are no quick fixes, so infrastructure work has to be scaled up as quickly as possible.""Last winter, the city saw seven severe air quality days in November, seven in December and one in January. The year earlier, November had nine severe days, while December and January saw four and six such days.""We expect winter this year to be less polluted because of the new GRAP. Also, the same party is in power in Punjab and Delhi, so coordination on stubble burning can be expected,"" said Shambhavi Shukla, programme manager (air quality), CSE. ""But climate change is an issue with factors like extreme meteorological conditions.""Experts believe that early Diwali (October 24) is also a positive sign for Delhi. ""Normally the air quality deteriorates at Diwali with cracker pollutants mixing with the stubble burning smoke. This year, Diwali comes before the intense farm fire season,"" explained Gufran Beig, founder project director, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, the Union earth science ministry's forecasting body. ""Also, we expect a timely withdrawal of the monsoon, which is a good thing because late withdrawal means poor air ventilation.""According to professor SN Tripathi of IIT Kanpur, who is also a member of the Commission for Air quality Management, the pollutant movement from stubble burning is crucial. ""We need to work on accurate monitoring of stubble burning using satellites to determine the direction the fumes are moving,"" said Tripathi. ""Proper information on fume progression can help coordinate GRAP measures with block-level officials."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Track the pollution level in your city,"Mothers highlight the need for clean air, carry out rallies, street plays to create awareness","BATHINDA: Mothers across the country, who are a part of the Warrior Moms network, which is a mothers collective for clean air, came together in various places to mark the International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies on Wednesday. The day is observed by the United Nations on September 7 every year and this year's theme- The Air We Share- focuses on the transboundary nature of air pollution, stressing on the need for collective accountability and action. Mothers in various states conducted activities running from rallies to awareness campaigns to mark the day. In Nagpur Maharashtra, a rally was organised where students performed street plays on air pollution at prominent squares during the rally. /Leena Buddhe, Warrior Mom and Director of NGO Centre for Sustainable Development said, ""We need to sensitise children about air pollution as it will instill behavioral change which will go a long way towards combating air pollution.""A town hall - Swasth Vayu, was organised to bring awareness among the public on clean air and health. It brought together doctors, scientists, environmentalists, experts, lawyers, legislators, all in their common role of citizens to engage with the masses, who are currently not engaged in the debate for clean air. ""Everyone, from citizens to experts to legislators agree that we need to act on air pollution. What is missing is to accept that this is a public health emergency and we should be dealing with it like one,"" said Bhavreen Kandhari. Film Choking Millions (produced by Warrior Moms and Turtle on a Hammock Films) was screened which talks about the disastrous health impacts of using chulhas. ""It is an important aspect of air pollution that often gets neglected but affects women and children,"" said Rama, a Warrior Mom and an ASHA worker from Delhi. Warrior Moms of Kolkata in collaboration with Switch On Foundation organised an 'alpona' event across communities and families of the city. Many residents brought out their feelings towards the air they breathe through 'alpona' or 'rangolis' done in a style typical of the art in the region. Warrior Moms Chandigarh continue their campaign to clean up Dadumajra with the announcement of a Dirty Picture Photo Contest. ""Dadumajra dumpsite is the unseen side of City Beautiful Chandigarh. Warrior Moms Punjab have been working towards getting this Dirty Picture clean, by meeting the MC Officials, protests and now showcasing a photo exhibition on life at the Dadumajra dumpsite. We are also organising a photo contest for youngsters to depict the pollution created when we don't manage our wastes properly,"" said Samita Kaur, a Warrior mom.In Sikanderpur, Gurugram, citizens spoke about the acute exposure to smoke faced daily by women and children as they sit at wood-burning chulhas to cook food and warm themselves. At the event, a small micro study on induction stoves was released and future work discussed in the presence of the community and local leaders. Sherebanu Frosh, a Warrior Mom said, ""Air pollution must now be viewed as real damage to the health and well-being of women and children, with the bulk of damage being borne by those who can least afford it.""Warrior Moms Pune organised a discussion at the Indradhanushya Environment Centre that brought together local communities from diverse backgrounds and doctors. PMC environment officer Mangesh Dighe spoke about the air pollution action the city administration is taking. Shila Dawre, a lady auto driver and traffic constables who were also present shared their experiences of working outdoors in polluted air conditions. ""It is important to hear stories of people who breathe in this air and have doctors validating their experiences and relating it to poor health conditions that we see all over the country. Air Pollution is the biggest killer and we need to address this urgently if we want a healthy future for our children."", said the organiser and Warrior Mom Anuja Bali. Nina Subramani, from Chennai has been putting together testimonials of women from across India on their struggles with the high costs of LPG cylinders. She said, ""It is important to hear testimonies from women and amplify their voices. Thousands of women still use wood-fired stoves - or worse still, they use any flammables they get their hands on - so now even the home is an unsafe space for women and their children. A developed nation should find it unacceptable that a woman has to choose between paying school fees or a utility bill and buying an LPG cylinder. On this day of blue skies for clean air, we need to pledge to keep demanding affordable clean cooking fuel for all."" Midhili Ravikumar, a Warrior Mom from Bangalore said, ""Women, especially the underprivileged, bear the brunt of unavailability of clean cooking fuels in our country.

"Big smoke: Past imperfect, future tense","CHANDIGARH: With less than a month to go for paddy harvesting season, the spectre of crop residue burning in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan haunts the national capital region (NCR). The four states burn 3.9 crore tonnes of paddy straw every year, suffocating Delhi and parts of IndoGangetic Plains (IGP) after the Kharif harves.Efforts fall shortThe efforts for the in-situ and ex-situ management of crop residue have fallen short, while the air quality keeps worsening every winter onset. The first efforts were in 2009, when a fast depleting water table forced the Punjab government to delay paddy sowing, introduce a law for preserving subsoil water, and started transplantation from June 1 to 20 (though it kept fluctuating). Delaying transplanting by a fortnight saved Punjab 2 lakh crore litres of water but it also delayed the harvest, making the burning of stubble coincide with a period of subdued air over Delhi.Use of crop residueAnother solution suggested was decentralised use of crop residues in coal-intensive industrial activities such as brick kilns. The second largest consumer of coal in India, the brick sector consumes 62 million tonnes of coal every year. /Substitution of biomass briquettes for coal would be able to absorb a significant portion of crop residues which would otherwise have been burnt in the fields. Biomass power plants in Punjab consume 1 million metric tons of paddy straw annually out of nearly 20 million metric tons of residue generated.Crop diversification Experts have stressed on the need to diversify the cropping pattern, moving away from water guzzling paddy to other crops, including maize. Punjab did try to push in sunflower and maize to replace paddy, but in a half-hearted manner. A report by the Centre for Policy Research (CPR) claims there has been an ongoing effort towards crop diversification in Punjab and Haryana, owing to the groundwater crisis. This diversification appears to have been accelerated by the Covid-linked disruptions. Absence of migrant labour for transplanting paddy in June-July owing to the lockdown had further increased the cultivated area for alternative crops like maize and cotton.'Need holistic approach' Air pollution due to crop residue burning first affects the farmers and their families and livestock. The solutions require a holistic approach having both short and long-term planning with systematic implementation on the ground. Incentive should be given to crop diversification, which is more sustainable and would be a step ahead in moving from food security to nutrition securitySignificant rise in burning incidence: Study The study done in partnership with Kings College University of Leicester, London, Panjab University and PGIMER Chandigarh shows that beyond meteorology, the area and amount of residue burned has increased significantly over the past almost two decades, mirroring government statistics on increasing crop yields.

"Punjab: '1.2 lakh machines available to tackle paddy straw', says Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal","CHANDIGARH: With the Centre turning down Punjab and Delhi's joint proposal to provide cash incentive of Rs 2,500 per acre to farmers for giving up stubble burning, Punjab agriculture minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal told TOI that the state government was now relying on 1.22 lakh machines, mostly super seeders, to check air pollution. Dhaliwal also expressed concern over damage to crops due to dwarf disease and said he will take up the matter with chief minister Bhagwant Mann soon.You met Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to discuss a joint strategy to tackle stubble burning. What new initiatives will Punjab take this time?I held a meeting with agriculture department officials of all the 154 blocks on Friday. /I asked them to remain in the field for the next one month and that they will be answerable for their areas. They will ensure proper distribution and usage of the residue management machines. An extensive awareness drive will also be carried out.Kejriwal was also very concerned over the problem of stubble burning. Unfortunately, we were banking on the Centre to pitch in with financial incentive, with contributions from Delhi and Punjab. But they have refused to fund the scheme. Nevertheless, we will manage by arranging more machines for the farmers. Farmers in many areas have earlier complained about the shortage of machines. What will be the availability this time?Over 1.22 lakh machines are being provided to the farmers and most of these are super seeders. As a new initiative, the agriculture department will make available five machines at the block level for farmers who cannot afford to spend over Rs 1 lakh to buy one (machine). Otherwise, the deputy commissioners allot machines through a lottery system to ensure fair play. Besides, this time farmers have bought 32,100 machines, availing a subsidy of Rs 452 crore. Cooperative societies and panchayats have also been provided machines to create pools. Over 90,000 machines have been provided to farmers in the last two years.We are also introducing a fool proof system to rule out machine pilferage as it happened under the previous governments. Each machine will have a unique identification with a laser and subsidy will go directly to the farmers.You also decided to rope in the Indian Agricultural Research Institute to spray bio decomposers to get rid of paddy stubble, as is being done in Delhi. How will it help in the overall plan?It will be taken up as a pilot project in over 5,000 acres and the system is more cost-effective. However, the hurdle is that the process takes 12 to 14 days to work and the farmers are usually in a hurry to sow wheat after paddy. We will try to identify the advanced paddy varieties on which this system will be most effective.Dwarf disease has hit paddy in many districts this time and the initial survey reveals that crops over 3,400 hectares were affected. Has any decision been taken to compensate for losses?I have asked the block officers of the agriculture department to conduct an extensive survey to evaluate the damage to paddy. I will discuss the matter with chief minister Bhagwant Mann once he returns from his Germany tour. The farmers have suffered heavy losses in parts of the state and the feedback I got from them is that despite spraying pesticides, they have not been able to control the disease. I had visited areas of Pathankot and Gurdaspur where paddy crops were hit.On Friday, I got reports from all the blocks in the state and it turns out that the damage is much more than the initial reports (suggested). In some blocks, paddy crops over 100 acres have been damaged. The AAP government is responsive to the needs of farmers and will stand by them in every crisis.Farmers have complained that they are yet to get the Rs 1,500 per acre incentive for opting for direct seeding of rice. Why the delay?The disbursal is set to begin shortly. There is a system of twos-layered surveys which has now been carried out. The payments will be made soon. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
New GRAP to come into force at first hint of AQI turning poor,"NEW DELHI: The modified Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to counter air pollution will come into force when the forecast shows that air quality is likely to touch the 'poor' category. The sub-committee constituted by the Commission for Air Quality Management for implementation of GRAP will conduct the first meeting to review the action plan. Due to rain spells in recent days, Delhi's air quality has been hovering in the 'satisfactory' category. /However, the air is predicted to deteriorate to 'moderate' category on Tuesday.VK Soni, head of environment and research centre at India Meteorological Department and a member of the CAQM sub-committee, said, ""The review of GRAP measures will be done when the air quality is predicted to reach the 'poor' category. The city's air quality is not expected to decline to this level this week. We will be considering the air quality three-four days in advance."" He added, ""Due to intense rain activity in the past week, PM2.5 and PM10 pollutant levels remained within the national standards for a few days.""However, the air in the capital deteriorated slightly on Monday with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of 100, which falls in the 'satisfactory' category. A slight haze was also observed early on Monday. As the AQI came close to the 'moderate' level, the air is expected to deteriorate on Tuesday.According to the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, a system developed by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, the air quality is likely to remain in the 'satisfactory' or moderate' category for the next seven days.During this winter season, CAQM has revised the GRAP benchmarks for the National Capital Region. Adverse air quality will now be classified under four stages. Restrictive actions under stages ll, lll and lV of GRAP will be invoked at least three days in advance of the AQI reaching the projected adverse level of that stage based on the forecast of air quality.According to the schedule of GRAP, stage I will be when AQI is between 201 and 300 in the 'poor' category. Among the stage I measures to be implemented are a ban on diesel generator sets and proper implementation of the guidelines on dust mitigation measures and construction and demolition waste. Stages II to IV would come into force when AQI is above 300. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Surprising! Paldi and Navrangpura most polluted areas in Ahmedabad: Study,"AHMEDABAD: Your heart may swell with pride at owning a house or a shop in posh Navrangpura or Paldi. Your lungs, though, are definitely taking a beating. A recent study has revealed that these two wards surprisingly have the city's highest concentration of particulate matter 2.5. While Paldi recorded PM2.5 at 80 micrograms (mcg) per cubic metre, Navrangpura registered a little above 76 mcg per cubic metre -- almost double the desired concentration of 40 mcg per cubic metre as per the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, 2019.'Long-term exposure to PM2.5 linked to cancer, heart diseases'Ahmedabad's air quality is fouled up by toxic fumes from factory chimneys, smoke from burning green and dry waste, as well as vehicle emissions. /So, it's natural to think that the industrial belt of Vatva, Narol, Pirana, and Naroda, or the jam-packed roads in the eastern and central areas of the city are the most polluted. However, an Isro-Space Applications Centre (SAC) funded study by the Department of Civil Engineering, School of Technology at Pandit Deendayal Energy University, found the ground situation contrary. The study simulated municipal ward-wise air pollution (PM2.5) concentration annually averaged for 2021. It used year-long data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra satellite. PM2.5 refers to fine particles which penetrate deep into the body and fuel inflammation in the lungs and respiratory tract, leading to risks of cardiovascular and respiratory problems, including a weak immune system. Studies also suggest that long-term exposure to PM2.5 may be associated with increased mortality from lung cancer and heart disease. Paldi resident Johar Vora told TOI, ""I live next to Tagore Hall in Paldi. The traffic jam near PT Thakkar college causes heavy pollution during the day. In the evening, wind from the Pirana sewage farm spreading a nauseating smell."" Associate professor Anurag Kandya of PDEU's Department of Civil Engineering said, ""This is the first municipal ward-wise simulated study of annual average PM2.5 concentration for any city in the country."" Kandya, who led the study along with Rishabh Oza and Aditya Vaghela, said, ""This study can help policymakers come up with targeted mitigation measures to reduce PM2.5 from specific areas in the city. The data can help the CPCB, GPCB and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation to strengthen the air action plan."" Mahesh Pandya, director of NGO Paryavaran Mitra, says, ""The CAG has already pointed out how continuous construction and road repairs along the BRTS and metro routes, poor traffic management, constantly decreasing green cover are leading to vehicular emissions of PM2.5 and PM 10. A comprehensive strategy to reduce ambient air pollution is the need of the hour, and we cannot delay any further.""  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Gurugram: No farm fire season yet, but September's air quality was worst in past 5 years","GURUGRAM: The full brunt of stubble burning is yet to be felt, but the city's air quality index (AQI) is already a concern before peak pollution season.The average AQI this September was the highest in the corresponding months in five years. While September 2022 saw an average AQI of 180 (upper levels of moderate), it was 133 in September 2021, 179 in 2020, 128 in 2019 and 154 the year before. The city saw 19 'moderate', 10 'satisfactory' and one 'good' air day this September. /In comparison, there were three 'good' days, two 'moderate' and 25 'satisfactory' days last year.Experts pointed to local pollution sources like garbage burning, road dust and weather conditions for the rising pollution levels this year. ""There are several factors for the worse air quality this September. First, the monsoon has been erratic this year. There has also been a rise in other sources of pollution, such as construction activities, vehicular movement and expansion of road networks,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy) at the Centre for Science and Environment.While emission sources for a defined area remain more or less the same throughout the year, the concentration varies with the season, experts said. For instance, air quality in north India usually deteriorates after the monsoon, which is the transition phase, because of low wind speed and temperature. It is believed that a wind speed of 2m/s or below can lead to surging pollution levels.""Yes, we need to consider the meteorological conditions and compare them with those in 2018. There was definitely a rise in commercial and industrial activity that led to a rise in pollutants this time,"" said Shubhansh Tiwari, a research associate at the Amity Centre for Air Pollution Control.Officials in the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) pointed out that the region showed an overwhelming impact of dust for several days in the first two weeks of September as it rained intermittently. ""Loose crystal soil and high wind effect in the Indo-Gangetic plain lead to an increase in dust levels. Vehicular traffic adds to it. Dust is a carrier of toxins from combustion sources and can therefore be harmful. However, the strategy to address this problem has to be diverse and not limited to only cleaning and sweeping of roads. Much of this problem is created by the lack of management at construction sites. For now, we are getting boards that will display the AQI of various areas real time. Action can be taken accordingly,"" said Kuldeep Singh, the HSPCB regional officer in Gurugram. The city recorded an AQI of 153 on Friday. While Gwal Pahari registered 108, Teri Gram showed 172 and Sector 51 179. No data was recorded at Vikas Sadan.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. According to guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board, when the AQI is in the 'moderate' category, there can be breathing discomfort among people with asthma and lung or heart diseases.

"Why Despite All-Clear Tag, Your Car May Be Adding To Pollution","New Delhi: When you pull up at a filling station from October 25, even before you unlock the fuel tank, you will have to take the pollution under control certificate from the glove box and hand it to the attendant. The pale yellow paper certifies your vehicle's emissions as meeting the standards and makes your car eligible to buy fuel. However, experts are unsure of how reflective of pollution the document really is.According to a Centre for Science and Environment study, vehicular emissions constitute over 46% of Delhi's local pollutants, causing an excess of carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen and sulphur to build up in the air. But, experts point out that the existing PUC certification does not deal with PM2.5 pollutants and toxic gases. /According to the experts, the current on-road vehicular emission inspection programme is based on the simple idle testing of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons emitted at two speeds along with a Lambda test for petrol vehicles and a smoke density test for diesel vehicles. They call the PUC a weak programme as it is difficult to control the tests for quality and ensure credible tests at innumerable small and decentralised test centres with poorly skilled staff. The compliance level in terms of number of vehicles turning up for tests is also very low in most parts of India. ""A PUC certificate is awarded based on CO and HC emissions, that too when the car is in an idle state, meaning the engine is not revving. Other emissions like NO2, VOC and PM2.5 at fast idling, or the engine at 2,500 rpm, are sometimes recorded, but not considered for certification,"" pointed out Abhinav Pandey, research scholar at Delhi Technological University. ""Besides, every vehicle is tested based on its built type. The least that should be done is to check the vehicle as per latest in-use emission normal."" According to Dr Rajeev Kumar Mishra, assistant professor of environment engineering, DTU, the existing emission compliance testing (and recertification) for in-use cars should be updated by including fast idle conditions as well as mass emission testing. ""Identifying vehicles for phasing-out should be based on accumulated mileage, maintenance records and performance for both the emission norms and not just by age,"" said Mishra. Shambhavi Shukla, programme manager (air pollution), CSE, said that while studies on source apportionment and emission inventory have shown motor vehicles to be the second largest contributor to particulate emissions, the big need was for a 100% compliance-based and credible PUC testing. ""It is important to upgrade to a more advanced vehicle emission surveillance system, such as remote sensing, for more stringent monitoring,"" said Shukla.Experts said the PUC staff should be skilled and mandatorily hold at least an Industrial Training Institute certificate. They should ideally check the onboard diagnostic system of the vehicle to see if the malfunction indicator light was on. If lit, PUC should be denied. But the untrained staff don't understand this. ""CSE conducted an audit in 2017 of the PUC setup in Delhi -NCR and found some lacunae,"" revealed Shukla. ""At many centres, the staff certified the car without even putting the pollution probe into the tailpipe. In NCR, there were many centres that had only printers, no testing equipment, not even a monitor. There were also instances where the same vehicle returned different results in different centres.""

Madhya Pradesh: Urban air pollution doubles in a month,"BHOPAL: Air pollution in major MP cities has sharply gone up as soon as rainfall activity slowed down. The air quality index increased to double in Bhopal, Gwalior and Jabalpur just in a month.The AQI of Bhopal, Gwalior and Jabalpur was respectively 133, 123, and 122 on Tuesday while the AQI a month earlier on September 4 was 57 for Bhopal, 54 for Gwalior and 65 for Jabalpur. The pollution levels in the three main cities were close to the same.The industrial capital, Indore, did not witness much change in its AQI. /The AQI on Tuesday was 80 while it was 84 a month earlier, as per the central pollution control board.Officials said, dust gets heavy in rain and does not fly in the air. The vehicular pollution also reduces as wet tyres and roads do not allow flying of pollutants and dust in air, as it settles down on the ground. It is the reason why pollution levels come down during rain. But damaged roads, flying dust from vehicles and increase in construction activities after showers leads to increase in the pollution levels.Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, the increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage, among others.PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases. During the corona restrictions too, the AQI of major MP cities was around 50.

Pune Municipal Corporation may stop cremations after 6pm at Vaikunth soon,"PUNE: The civic administration is contemplating stopping cremations after 6pm at the Vaikunth crematorium in the heart of the city in an attempt to reduce air pollution.The move is based on recommendations by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute. Several residents from areas around the crematorium in Navi Peth have complained about the smoke from the facility and the possible health hazards it could cause. The crematorium handles almost 70% of cremations despite the fact that the Pune Municipal Corporation has set up 24 crematoriums, both electrical and gas-operated, across the city. /These other facilities are not used often.""The pollution is high at night because of the wood burnt for cremations,"" said Vikrant Latkar, a resident near the crematorium. He has also filed a petition about this in the Bombay High Court. ""Locals had raised the issue with PMC officials, after which a team of experts visited the facility."" Aniket Mahabal, another resident, said: ""Citizens should be urged to use facilities in other areas. Locals are suffering due to pollution. Some steps are also needed to maintain the Vaikunth crematorium properly.""Last year, a team of experts had visited the crematorium and made several suggestions - add another scrubber to the facility's chimney for more filtration of smoke, improve operational practices and the handling of bodies, and train personnel who operate the electrical crematorium.The health department and electrical department of PMC are working on a proposal to change the timings, besides appealing to citizens to use other crematoriums. ""The final decision about stopping the cremations has not been taken yet. The proposal is at the primary discussion level,"" said Shrinivas Kandul, the head of PMC's electrical department. The PMC has installed sensors in residential and commercial establishments around the Vaikunth facility to check air quality. It will check the presence of pollutants such as carbon, nitrogen and sulphur particles in the air. Despite complaints about smoke and ash from residents, PMC said it uses eco-friendly methods such as white coal to cremate the bodies. Over the past two years, the city has recorded at least 10 to 15 coronavirus-related deaths every day, besides non-Covid fatalities. During the peak of the pandemic, Covid deaths were as high as 80 a day.PMC had set aside the Kailash crematorium for Covid deaths during the first two phases of the pandemic.

Bihar: Crackers banned in 3 cities this Diwali too,"PATNA: The state government on Saturday announced a complete ban on the production, sale and use of all types of firecrackers in three cities, including Patna, Muzaffarpur and Gaya, which are marked as non-attainment cities under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). The ban also covers green crackers, the officials confirmed. ""There is complete ban on firecrackers, including green crackers, in non-attainment cities where the air quality as per the records maintained by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), is polluted beyond the prescribed national ambient air quality standards, abiding by the rules of the National Green Tribunal (NGT),"" said Arun Kumar, senior scientist and air pollution expert at Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB).He said the sale and use of crackers in Patna, Muzaffarpur and Gaya have been banned during Diwali to protect the health of the vulnerable people against the hazardous levels of smoke, including toxic compounds that are emitted from smoke of crackers. ""Apart from non-attainment cities, the other cities will be allowed to sale, produce and use green crackers only,"" he said.The public relation officer of BSPCB, Birendra Kumar, said that the same restriction was in force last year as well in view of poor air quality in Patna and neighboring cities during the winter season. /""The letter will be sent to the enforcing agencies, including district authorities and police to ensure the complete ban on production, sale and use of firecrackers.

The study was conducted over a 10-year period - from January 2008 to March 2018 - at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi.Head of department, pulmonary medicine, AIIMS, Dr Anant Mohan, said historically, lung cancer has been prevalent more in men than in women, but the trend seems to be changing in the past few years in several parts of the world.""The reasons are likely to be multifactorial, with changing smoking habits and environmental toxic substances/biomass exposure, especially in women residing in rural regions, along with better accessibility to healthcare facilities allowing more in the female population to seek medical care,"" he said.The study revealed that adenocarcinoma (cancer that forms in the glandular tissue), or ADC, increased from 9.5% to 35.9% and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) from 25.4% to 30.6%. Non-smokers were younger, mostly female and educated, had a higher prevalence of ADC and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations and had better survival rates, said the study.A recently-concluded unpublished study of the pulmonary department, records of patients diagnosed with lung cancer over a 12-year period - between January 2008 and March 2020 - revealed that the increasing trend of lung cancer in females could partially be due to non-tobacco exposures, such as indoor air pollution or poor environmental or urban air quality. /For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
