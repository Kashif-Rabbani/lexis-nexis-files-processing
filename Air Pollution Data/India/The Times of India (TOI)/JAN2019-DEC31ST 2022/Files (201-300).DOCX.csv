Delhi government staggers office hours for its staff,"NEW DELHI: Delhi government on Friday announced staggered office hours for its employees in the wake of deteriorating air quality which forced the Supreme Courtappointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority to declare a public health emergency in Delhi-NCR. The staggered office timings will be applicable from November 4 to 15 when the odd-even scheme will be in force./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/The blanket of haze over Delhi-NCR for a few days has thickened further. As the air quality continues to dip, people face burning sensation in their eyes when exposed to the outside air besides breathing issues.A general administration department order said that working hours of a total of 42 government offices have been staggered. The government offices have been divided into ITO and Civil Lines zones. In both the zones, employees will be coming to offices at two different times. On weekdays, there will be two shifts-from 9.30am to 6pm for around half of the government offices, and from 10:30 am to 7pm for the remaining ones. No private firm has been included in the plan.The idea behind staggering the office hours is to ensure less congestion on the roads which will check the rising pollution levels. It is applicable to all the employees and officers working in different departments of the government. It excludes government employees like teachers, nurses, doctors, etc.""All employees engaged in administrative reforms, environment, power, planning, health and family welfare, public works department, education, transport, municipal corporations of Delhi, etc. would be required to come according to the staggered office hours,"" said an official.At a press conference, CM Arvind Kejriwal said that this is the first experiment of staggered office timings so the private offices are not included. The private firms would be considered for the staggered office hours next time the government implements it, he added.Sources said that on an average, over 75% government offices open at 9.30am and close at 6 pm, while the rest of the offices such as health and education open at 9am. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said that the staggering of office hours is another major step by the Delhi government to combat air pollution. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Track the pollution level in your city,Burning trash mounds mock CM Yogi Adityanath directive,"LUCKNOW: An order from the chief minister to stop burning garbage notwithstanding, the practice - a major cause of air pollution - is continuing unabated in the state capital. The district administration and Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC), acting on the directive, had asked officials of all the eight zones in the city to conduct routine inspections to stem the problem. Zonal officials and those in charge of beats were warned of punitive measures if they failed to implement the order.However, burning garbage is still common in areas like Lalbagh, Latouche Road, New Hyderabad, Kaiserbagh and Daliganj, where residents complained to TOI about breathing distress, nasal congestion and headache.In Lalbagh, sanitation workers burn mounds of trash on the roadside, making children cough their way to school. /""Our morning begins with breathing heavily polluted air. Garbage burning is rampant. There is no one to stop the sweepers from doing so. School-going children are inhaling poison every day,"" said resident Akansha Singh. As if toxic smoke from garbage were not enough, residents of Latouche Road rued that wires and cycle tubes were also frequently burnt. ""The area is dotted with electronics and cycle repair shops. They junk everything on the road and the same is burnt by sweepers in the morning. It is a health emergency for senior citizens with low immunity and lung function,"" said Gautam Balamurli.Residents of Kaiserbagh are livid because complaints to the LMC about garbage burning have fallen on deaf ears. ""Garbage mounds are set on fire at least three times a week. Thick, black smoke engulfs the neighbourhood. Every second person is complaining of headache or nasal congestion, but the LMC doesn't care,"" fumed Bhavna Tiwari.Civic officials insisted that the LMC had prohibited burning of garbage three years ago. It had also decided to penalise sanitation workers with a day's wage cut while a fine of Rs 500 was imposed on other offenders (commoners/non-employees). ""We have penalised more than 20 people in and around the city. We are conducting regular drives and garbage burning will stop in the city very soon,"" said an LMC official without mentioning when and how. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air pollution spikes lung ailments, experts tell people to wear masks","Jaipur: Rising levels of air pollution are taxing health of city residents. Experts have appealed to the people to wear good quality masks and not to step out during early morning.Clinics and hospitals are witnessing sharp increase in the number of patients with respiratory problems. ""At least 20% cases of respiratory problems have increased due to air pollution. /We are advising people not to step out during early morning due to fog which goes into the lungs,"" Pulmonologist and former superintendent at SMS Hospital, Dr Virendra Singh said. It is the collective pollution of vehicles, crackers, burning of stubble in neighbouring states, he added.Although it was Sunday, the city's pulmonologists remained busy. ""It is Sunday but I am receiving calls from patients. I have attended 20 calls of problems related to air pollution. People are complaining of throat irritation, burning sensation in eyes, skin irritation and allergies. It is happening even when people are indoors as it was Sunday. Had it been any other weekday, the problem might have been graver,"" HOD, Institute of Respiratory Diseases at SMS Hospital, Dr Narendra Khippal said.Doctors have advised people to use proper masks to avoid air pollution. ""The masks must have a pore size of 2.5 micrometres or less-while filtering out PM2.5 particles. Industries, vehicles and crop burning usually emit PM2.5. But firecrackers also contribute substantially to this. One needs a powerful mask to stay protected from them. Surgical masks, even at their best capacity, can barely protect you. Go for masks equipped with activated carbon layers and filters-to stop PM2.5 or higher particles,"" Consultant - Pulmonology and Chest and Sleep Medicine at a private hospital, Dr Ankit Bansal said.Patients already suffering from respiratory diseases are advised to take medicines on time. ""Everybody is affected with recent increase in air pollution. Those with asthma, COPD are facing severe breathing difficulty. People with wheezing and cough not responding to usual inhalers and antibiotics. They need additional corticosteroids for relief,"" senior consultant (pulmonology) at a private hospital, Dr K K Sharma said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Is air pollution also making us depressed? Studies agree,"Unless you have been living under the rock, you must be well aware of the thick envelope of toxic air that has engulfed Delhi-NCR. The residents are waking up to irritated eyes, sore throat and a sensation of choking. The air pollution levels have reached a disturbing three-year high, well into the ""severe"" range.The dangers of air pollution on human health From respiratory distress to heart, brain and even the health of the expectant mothers, these unusually high levels of particulates in the air are known to cause several acute and chronic medical conditions. /However, in addition to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and respiratory symptoms, this dangerous cocktail of air pollutants can damage your mental health as well.The psychological impact of the choking airExposure to high levels of air pollution has been linked with affecting brain development in children and worsen the existing mental health conditions. Yes, the dreaded air pollution seems to damage much more than the visible physiological effects. According to a journal published in the Lippincott Portfolio by Wolters Kluwer, the mental health of the teenagers is more susceptible to the damage caused by airborne particles.The studyTo conduct the research, 144 teenagers were given a social stress test which included a five-minute speech and a math test. Shockingly, after studying the adolescents' heart rate and other bodily responses, it was found that teenagers with a higher autonomic response to stress, also had an increased level of PM 2.5 near their house. While the association between polluted air and greater stressors has not been explained in the study, it re-emphasises the fact that toxic air may also damage neurodevelopment and cognitive function.How air pollution is STRESSING us outIt does not matter which news channel you put on or newspaper you pick up to read, they are flooded with the impact of deadly levels of air pollution. Moreover, the doctors have strongly advised avoiding stepping outside unless absolutely needed. People have also been asked to stop working out outdoors and avoid strenuous exercises which may cause rapid breathing. Short winter days, grey skies and the presence of choking air everywhere are bound to stress anyone out and contribute to a persistent low mood.Can air pollution also plunge you into depressionA report published in the Ochsner Journal points to data from China published in 2018. According to that data, every 1 standard deviation rise in particulate matter over an average PM2.5 concentration increases the likelihood of having mental illness (including depression) by 6.67%. Hence, dirty air is not only suffocating your lungs, but it also impacts the way you think. There is clearly a desperate need to conduct in-depth researches to determine the extent of damage air pollution is doing to our mental health.The bottom lineFor now, instead of panicking over the stuffy air and AQI updates, it is more important to focus on what needs to be done. From carpooling, reducing the number of times you use your car, using public transport, planting more trees to completely avoiding burning trash, there is a lot that can be done on an individual level.

"Air quality 'poor' in city again, Gehlot asks Centre to take lead","Jaipur: The effect of Delhi pollution has started to affect Rajasthan. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot expressed concern over the deteriorating air quality in the city and asked the Centre to work with the Delhi government to contain the problem. On Sunday morning, a thick layer of haze enveloped Jaipur. /The city's air quality, which was categorised poor post-Diwali and slightly improved over the last four days, again turned 'poor.' Calling it as a health emergency, Gehlot urged the Centre to address the menace. ""It is a health emergency, which only Delhi govt can't solve alone. The Centre has to take the lead,"" Gehlot tweeted on Sunday.He expressed concern about the health of people that was at risk due to air pollution. ""Rising pollution levels in Delhi and in neighbouring states, including Rajasthan, is a matter of grave concern. People are suffering since long, especially children and old people,"" Gehlot tweeted.On October 28 (post Diwali) and October 29, the ambient air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 290 and 271 and categorised as poor. Following that, the air quality improved a bit and was categorised as 'moderate' on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. However, the AQI level rose to 249 on Sunday.According to the Centre Pollution Control Board, when the AQI is categorised as poor, people start feeling breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure.""It is not winter and it was not fog. We were shocked to see the haze early morning,"" said Ajit Gaur, a resident of Vidhyadhar Nagar.Gehlot tweeted a video also and said, ""Delhi has turned into a gas chamber and the entire country is worried about it as it is the capital of the country. The pollution is now engulfing Rajasthan especially in districts such as Bharatpur and Jaipur. We have contacted the Centre and requested to work in this direction along with the Delhi government.""He said the government should think of permanent solution rather than temporary measures such as closure of schools and industries for five days.

Smog tightens stranglehold,"Ludhiana: Air quality in Ludhiana deteriorated to its second worst value this year on Sunday, with the pollutant PM2.5 rising to 337 on the AQI and making the PCCB and city MC look at ways to improve conditions. PM2.5 is particulate matter which is suspended in the air and is 2.5 millimetres or less in diameter. Because it is too fine, it goes deep in the lungs and prolonged exposure to it increases a person's risk to heart disease and stroke, lung cancer, chronic lung disease, and respiratory infections.To decide on remedial steps, MC commissioner K P Brar said she had called an ""urgent meeting"" on Monday to discuss steps the civic body could take to resolve the situation. /A day after Diwali, which fell on November 27, AQI value in the city was 353. The AQI, or air-quality index, value on Sunday came under the ""very poor"" category. Punjab Pollution Control Board chairman Satwinder Marwaha said the teams comprising officials and staff of the board, and departments of revenue, health, agriculture and police had been visiting farmers and motivating them not to burn stubble and telling them about the benefits of not doing so.Marwaha said the high AQI value was because wind was not blowing across the region and, thus, pollutants had been suspended in air. ""Overcast skies and lower temperature have also not let pollutants rise and disperse,"" he added.The PPCB chairman said air quality would improve if it rains over the next few days. According to the Indian Meteorological Department, rain has been forecast in the city on November 6, 7 and 8. Marwaha said pollutants from the bursting of crackers on Diwali had also not yet been completely dispersed in the air and this was adding to the city's problems. In Punjab, Ludhiana was the fourth worst-affected by air pollution, mostly being blamed on Diwali and stubble burning. Patiala (415), Mandi Gobindgarh (381) and Khanna (360) had worse air quality.When contacted, Ludhiana deputy commissioner Pardeep Aggarwal said their teams were visiting villages where stubble burning was widespread and taking action. However, he didn't elaborate on what type of action was being taken. On the other hand, city residents complained of the government not doing enough for the people. ""Farmers are blamed for stubble burning, but I think that government has not come with best the possible solution on the issue. The government should provide them with some minimum amount for transporting stubble. If they don't do it, we will continue to suffer, especially the elderly and children,"" said Harjot Singh, a city resident.A homemaker from Pakhowal Road, Harpreet Kaur, said her son had started developing a breathing problem. ""We have to put him on nebulizer. My daughter also sneezes frequently. It is difficult to watch them suffer. The government must come up with longterm solutions,"" she said.

Kejriwal thanks people for support,"New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal congratulated the people of Delhi for supporting the odd-even scheme, which kicked in on Monday. Delhi government, he said, is doing all it can to check air pollution. ""The smoke and pollution have engulfed the whole of north India. /We are concerned about how pollution is severely affecting Delhi and the health of the people, especially the children. So Delhi government, together with the people of Delhi, is doing whatever it can,"" the chief minister said.

Stating that his government has been supported ""even in the harshest of measures"", the chief minister said, ""We have successfully battled dengue in the past two and half months and I hope we will be able to control pollution in the same way.""Slamming BJP for ""politicising"" the issue, Kejriwal said, ""Our central ministers should have appreciated the people's efforts rather than politicising the issue."" The Centre and the other governments concerned will have to deliberate on stubble burning, he pointed out. ""Only the Centre can find a solution to the real reason of pollution, which is stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. Why are they blaming Delhi alone?"" Kejriwal asked. More buses will be deployed if shortage is noticed on any route during the road-rationing scheme, the CM said. While the cab aggregators have promised to refrain from surge pricing, ""I want to appeal to the auto drivers not to overcharge or else we will have to take strict action,"" he warned.

"Farmers' make a difference, reduce air pollution in 34 adopted villages","Ludhiana: As the pollution levels in the state has risen due to the ongoing paddy harvesting season, a group of trained farmers have made a difference and managed to reduce air pollution in 34 villages adopted by them to check stubble burning by motivating farmers.Apart from educating farmers about the ill effects of stubble burning, the group has also promoted use of machinery to check the practice.""Five years ago, we would see stubble being burnt and the repercussions it would have on soil as well as humans. We then started a mission against stubble burning from a village in Moga. After talking to farmers in many villages of Barnala, Sangrur, Moga and Ludhiana districts, we found that by motivating and creating awareness among farmers we could bring a change among them so that they give up the practice of burning the crop residue,"" said Dr Harminder Singh, a homeopath-cum-progressive farmer, who is one of the directors of the Gadri Baba Dulla Singh Giani Nihal Singh Foundation, which works against stubble burning.""With sustained efforts along with a team of experts from various departments and groups, we were successful in bringing a change in 11 villages in Raikot area and ensured that farmers didn't burn stubble in more than 11,000 acre land. After getting encouraging results, we decided to adopt 34 villages in Raikot area this year to educate and create awareness among villagers to give up the practice. /We are happy that farmers in more than 40,000 acre did not burn stubble in the ongoing paddy harvesting season,"" he said.The founder of the foundation said they had around a thousand members which include four to five trained farmers in every village they had adopted.He said they had around four WhatsApp groups with around 300 members each and used these groups to make farmers aware on what material should be used for healthy agricultural practices.Sidhu, 42, who was honoured by the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) and the Union department of agriculture and farmers' welfare during a function organised at New Delhi in September, said their work had begun many months before the onset of the paddy harvesting season. He said they held three to four meetings every month in each adopted village to aware farmers about the benefits of not burning stubble.""During such meetings in villages, we tell farmers that the soil structure gets damaged because of stubble burning apart from affecting the human health. We also tell them about the benefits of incorporating stubble in the soil and how it enriches the same. We do inform them about how cost of sowing is saved by around 50%, use of pesticides is decreased, weeds do not infest in the crops, and the quality of crops improves. We inform them about the use of machinery for such activity,"" said the director of the foundation, who belongs to Jalaldiwal and has not burnt stubble for more than five years now.He said apart from villages like Jalaldiwal, Rajgarh, Govindgarh, Bassiyan, Jauraan, Nihaluwal, Sehwajpura, Daddahor, Boparai Khurd, they have worked in villages of Barnala, including Mehal Kalan, Nehaluwal, Kalal Majra and Kirpal Singh Waala besides some villages in Sangrur and Moga districts.The founder of the foundation said with increased awareness among farmers, four machinery banks had been set up at Sehbajpura, Daddahor, Johlam and Jalaldiwal villages.He said apart from those farmers who have set up such banks, other farmers also used the machinery, including happy seeder, rotavators, mulcher and MB plough (used for sowing seeds after incorporating stubble in the soil) at nominal cost of Rs 150 to Rs 200 per hour depending on the type of machines.Those running such banks said they were happy with the change.""After coming to know about the ill effects of stubble burning and benefits of incorporating stubble into fields, we, a group of eight farmers, set up the machinery bank last year. Not only are we proud of the fact that we don't indulge in stubble burning and pollute the air and soil, but are happy that we have increased the productivity by incorporating the stubble (with the help of machines) into soil. The profit has increased and bond between farmers has become stronger,"" said 52-year-old Gurtej Singh, a progressive farmer, who has not burnt stubble in his 15-acre farm land for the last many years. His son had suffered respiratory problem because of the smoke during the harvesting season.He said they gave two happy seeders, MB plough, rotavator, chopper etc of the bank on rent to around 25 farmers.Farmers say that there was an improvement in the air quality in villages where large numbers of farmers had given up burning stubble.""The foundation is doing a great job in villages by creating awareness among farmers about the ill effects of stubble burning and benefits of incorporating stubble in soil. In our village, many farmers have given up the practice and there is a visible improvement in the air quality during the harvesting season. Earlier, one could see smoke-engulfed air. The increased awareness has solved the problem to a larger extent,"" said Darshan Singh of Rajgarh village, where the foundation has worked.He said many years ago elderly and children in the village would suffer the most during the paddy harvesting season because of stubble burning, but things have changed now.-------------------------------One of the directors of the foundation had suffered because of environmental pollution. Tota Singh, 33, a progressive farmer of Dina Sahib village and director of the foundation, said his nine-year-old son had genes-related problem which was because of environmental issue.He said his main reason to start the campaign was because of the problem faced by his son.""We started a campaign about five years ago from our village and now we have adopted a cluster of villages in Raikot apart from working in Moga, Barnala, Sangrur and Ludhiana districts,"" said.He added they raised their voice against the practice and found for the same as well.-------------------------------------Members of the foundation said during the harvesting season, they stayed in villages for several days and provided technical assistance to farmers.

"Patna air quality worst in eastern India, AQI above 400","Patna: The air quality of Patna on Sunday turned from 'very poor' to 'severe' with Air Quality Index (AQI) touching above 400 mark - the worst in eastern region in the last 48 hours. In fact, Patna ranked 27th in worst air pollution among 99 cities across the country.According to figures released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), while Patna's AQI was recorded as 413 at 4pm on Sunday, Muzaffarpur and Gaya's AQI were recorded at a 'very poor' 369 and 317 respectively.The AQI is rated as 'good' between 0-50, 'satisfactory' for 51-100, 'moderate' for 101-200, 'poor' for 201-300, 'very poor' for 301-400 and 'severe' for 410-500. The severe situation can affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases.A Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) official said the pollution level in the city could have increased due to unfavourable meteorological conditions like low wind speed, bursting of crackers during festivals (Diwali & Chhath Puja) and low temperature.On Saturday, the city's air quality was even worse than Delhi's with 428 as concentration of PM 2.5 level (fine particulate matter in the air with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometre) was higher. /The average AQI of Delhi was 399. PM 2.5 was the primary pollutant at 413 microgram per cubic metre (ug/m3), followed by nitrogen dioxide at 25 ug/m3, sulfur dioxide 79 ug/m3 and carbon monoxide at 94 ug/m3 recorded on Sunday. PM 2.5, which triggers respiratory and coronary heart illnesses among people, had been essential component in air pollution in city, the official added.BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh told TOI on Sunday that in view of the high AQI level of Patna, a health advisory will be issued on Monday. Ghosh said bursting of crackers during the Chhath, decline in temperature and low wind velocity played a role in severely affecting the city's air quality. ""The stable dust particles of PM 2.5 will disperse only with the rise in wind velocity. The other factors that led to poor air quality are construction of buildings and roads without green cover among others, movement of old vehicles and deforestation,"" he said.He, however, said: ""There is no need to panic because the AQI data that we have is only based on one monitoring station located at the Planetarium. It covers only a limited area where there is excessive vehicular movement.""He suggested that given the city's severe air quality, people should make it a point to wear masks when they are outdoors to avoid health problems. The BSPCB will again issue instructions to contractors to use screens during construction of roads and buildings to prevent dust from construction site from entering adjoining residential areas, Ghosh added.PMCH superintendent Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said people who were suffering from health ailments, especially asthma and other respiratory problems, should avoid morning walk given the high dust concentration in the atmosphere.When contacted, Pradhan Parth Sarthi, professor at Department of Environmental Science of Central University of South Bihar (CUSB) and standing committee member of Bihar State Action Plan for Climate Change, said the cloudy condition in city was mainly due to the cyclonic storm in Arabian sea. ""Because of cloudy condition, the velocity of wind will not increase. It can only happen if the northwesterly wind occurs. However, such a situation do not prevail precently,"" he said.

"City air quality improves, but still remains 'very poor'","PATNA: The air quality in the state capital improved slightly on Monday but remained in 'very poor' category post-Diwali due to decreasing wind speed which drastically reduced the chances of dispersion of the pollutants in the atmosphere.According to the Air Quality Index (AQI) released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the PM 2.5 (fine particulate matter in the air with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres) level was recorded at 382 in Patna around 4pm on Monday. It has dropped from 'severe' (413) to 'very poor' in last 24 hours.The air quality index of Muzaffarpur remained unchanged at 369 while Gaya also witnessed slight improvement in its air quality with 294 on Monday against 317 recorded on Sunday evening.PM 2.5 was the primary pollutant at 382 microgram per cubic metre (ug/m3), followed by Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) at 31 ug/m3, Sulfur Dioxide 83 ug/m3, Carbon Monoxide at 86 ug/m3 and ozone at 150 ug/m3 on Monday. As per the CPCB bulletin, the ""very poor"" conditions can cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure.Among all pollutants, the most harmful ones are PM2.5 (which includes vehicles, garbage burning, diesel generators, factories emission among others) and NO2 (emitted from vehicles and factories). These pollutants can cause asthma, cancer, strokes and Alzheimer's disease, experts feel.The environment experts in the city opined that air pollution would remain ""very poor"" or ""severe"" throughout this month due to climatic conditions, including absence of western disturbances.Pradhan Parth Sarthi, professor at Department of Environmental Science of Central University of South Bihar (CUSB), told this newspaper on Sunday that environmentalists have recently witnessed that western disturbances mainly originating in the Caspian Sea or Red Sea has reduced. /""Due to reduction in western disturbances, we are not getting good amount of rain during winter season, resulting in high level of pollution,"" he said.""The present environment conditions of smog and haze can improve only with increase in wind velocity and rainfall. According to scientific methods, rain washes the pollutants in the environment while wind disperses the pollutants,"" Sarthi said.Sarthi, who is also the standing committee member of Bihar State Action Plan for Climate Change, said the aggravated air pollution in the city was due to vehicular emission or construction works in the open. ""The same amount of vehicles moved in city and construction works are carried out throughout the year, but such smog conditions did not prevail in other seasons of the year,"" he said.Weather experts at Patna Meteorological Department said during winter onset, cooler air is trapped under the warmer air near the earth surface. ""It forms a kind of atmospheric lid. Such situation leaves no space for pollutants to disperse in the atmosphere,"" the weatherman said.During summer, the level of pollutants decreases as the warmer air rises freely. It makes the boundary layer thicker and provides enough space for pollutants to disperse in the air. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
City breathes easy day after AQI plummeted to 'poor',"Jaipur: Air quality improved slightly in the city, from 'poor' to 'moderate' on Monday. The residents woke up with reduced levels of Particulate Matter (PM 2.5) in comparison to Sunday morning. /The PM2.5 at Jaipur police commissionerate was recorded at 96 microgram per cubic metre at 8am. At the same time on Sunday, the PM2.5 level was 176 microgram per cubic metre. The Air Quality Index (AQI) improved slightly in the city. The AQI came down from 246 to 162 in the past 24 hours, which improved air quality. The thick layer of haze, which was present on Sunday morning, was reduced and visibility also improved.According to health experts, the spike in super fine particulate matter began around Diwali. The worst day in terms of AQI was on October 28, when it rose to 290 from 134 in just a day. Health experts attributed the current rise in AQI on Sunday to stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, high vehicular movement during festive season and also use of crackers on Diwali. Jaipur is also vulnerable to air pollution as it is situated in neighbourhood of Delhi, where air pollution has almost becoming a health emergency. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had raised the issue and demanded Centre to team up with the Delhi government to find out permanent solution.

How broccoli can be the secret remedy to fight toxic pollution from the roots!,"Delhi woke up to a bad air once again. As air pollution levels continue to rise and the harmful air quality has left citizens gasping for air every breath, detoxification, cleanses and natural remedies have become the go-to- hacks to fight the nasty air pollution.As your lungs choke, depending on pollution-fighting purifiers and masks is an expensive but healthy option. It is important that you stock up with the right nutrients in your diet which focus on cleaning up your system, naturally and actively fight the deadly pollutants. /Union Minister for Health, Dr. Harshvardhan recently talked of certain remedial measures, such as including antioxidant-rich vegetables and fruits in the diet to suppress the effects and make the body better equipped to fight the nasty pollution. One vegetable he did talk about includes broccoli.How can broccoli help?Broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable that includes a lot of good nutrients in it. A true superfood, the green stub contains a lot of fiber, which regulates digestion and actively fights toxins that settle in the cavities. It is also believed that a vegetable like broccoli helps cleanse the digestive system, eliminates waste and the toxins which the body might have absorbed from the air, soil, food or bad food and not to forget, the polluting carcinogens which find an easy way to get in this bad season.Nutrient-wise, broccoli supplies good antioxidants, Vitamin A, beta-carotene, B complex, folic acid, minerals which help fight inflammation, chronic health risks and also strengthens cell membranes. It also works towards maintaining blood sugar levels, reducing the chances of degenerative diseases, certain types of cancer and optimize your gut health as well.However, what makes it an effective anti-pollution food is its ability to act down on certain pollutants. It's not the sprouts themselves but the components found in the stub which are good for the body. In fact, a study conducted in China found out that broccoli sprouts were particularly helpful in fighting and detoxing away the air pollutants from the root. When you eat broccoli, the phytochemical present in it, called glucoraphanin initiates a chemical reaction that attaches itself to the harmful benzene compound, breaks it down and recharges the body to excrete it faster, before it gets the time to do the damage on the cellular level. The same mechanism has also been found helpful to get rid of toxins associated with pollution and cigarette smoke. Hence, detoxifying the body by consuming a simple vegetable like fresh broccoli juice or smoothie as soon as you hit home can alleviate some of the health risks at the ground level.The people in the new study who drank a concentrated tea made with broccoli spouts excreted 61 percent more benzene and 23 percent more acrolein, a lung irritant, as compared with a group who drank a placebo beverage.There you have it! An easy smog and pollution-fighting drink that costs less than an air purifier! For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Official apathy turns situation in Auto Nagar from bad to worse,"Vijayawada: Poor solid waste management in Auto Nagar and the apathy of Jawahar Auto Nagar Industrial Area Local Authority (IALA) to it has begun to affect the lives residents living around the hub. Jawahar Auto Nagar (Jawaharlal Nehru Auto Nagar Industrial Estate) is the first largest auto industrial hub in Asia that was established in 1966. Today, around two lakh labourers and mechanics work here. The IALA handles several core administrative issues in Auto Nagar, including sanitation. /But a lack of required infrastructure and manpower have been preventing it from dealing with solid waste and other garbage. Consequently, the disparity between the rate at which garbage is produced and the rate at which it is disposed is leading to it piling on the roads and adding to the air pollution. Around 1,200 major and minor industries situated in Auto Nagar generates tonnes of solid waste every day. It is common sight now to find major roads covered in toxic industrial wastes, including the main road adjacent to Auto Nagar bus depot. Moreover, burning of garbage for its quick disposal has only added to the woes of the residents living around the hub, including Kanuru, Sanath Nagar and Patamata areas. Speaking to TOI, K Rama Murthy, a motor mechanic, said, ""It has been almost three years since that mountain of garbage has been cleaned on the Autonagar Ramavarappadu main road. Streets are not cleaned regularly. Sanitation workers are simply burning the garbage to reduce their burden."" ""Jawahar Autonagar is ruining our health. We are unable to breath fresh air owing to the smoke and dust emitted from the garbage dumped on the streets. We request the Vijaywada Municipal Corporation to handle sanitation at Auto Nagar,"" M Naniah Chowdary, a resident of Sanath Nagar, told TOI.When TOI spoke to officials of IALA about the situation, they said they are about to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with VMC to handle solid waste and sanitation in Jawahar Auto Nagar. IALA authorities added that VMC has already started cleaning the clogged drains. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
This is the 'biggest mistake' you can do while using air purifiers,"New Delhi: If you think shutting yourself inside a room and turning on the air purifier is the best possible way to fight the bad air that has gripped Northern India then you are severely mistaken. Top doctors along with air purifier brands are suggesting that while purifiers filter particulate matter in air, they do not get rid of Carbon dioxide. Keeping doors and windows shut all night or even all day will drastically increase the level of Carbon dioxide inside the room which might lead to adverse health effects. /It is important to understand that air quality is not just about measuring PM 2.5 levels and keeping it low.""Of course, it goes without saying that an air purifier is a must have device for households today given the high level of pollution. It is the bare minimum you can do to breather clean when you are inside your house. But the reality is that you need to have air circulation. While air purifiers are not effective when doors and windows are kept open, at the same time, it is important to have some air circulation happening. Otherwise, you will get clean air inside the room that has high levels of carbon dioxide,"" said Dr Vivek Nangia, director & head, pulmonology, critical care & sleep medicine, Fortis Hospital.Most households in India tend to have small-to-medium-sized rooms that are shared by family members. Thus, the level of carbon dioxide increases rapidly and despite using an air purifier and shutting all windows, there is a feeling of uneasiness. ""No doctor will ever suggest you to do this. Despite the pollution, sufficient air exchange is needed and locking yourself inside a room with an air purifier is just not a solution,"" said Dr Ashok Kumar, specialist chest, heart diseases & diabetes. ""As the level of carbon dioxide increases overnight inside a sealed room while you are sleeping besides an air purifier, you will wake up with a heavy head. You will not get a good sleep and will feel stressed and lethargic in the morning,"" said Dr Kumar. ""If someone has a weak heart or if already suffer from any heart disease, the chances of a heart attack increases in the night when he or she is sleeping with doors and windows shut. If someone has already suffered a heart attack, then the high levels of carbon dioxide can cause a repeat attack,"" he added.Ashish Gupta, sales head, B2B, Sharp and Rohit Bansal, founder, Purelogic Labs India & AQI India echoed the same concerns. ""It is a bad idea to shut yourself inside a room and sit beside an air purifier. In India, we do not understand the concept of ventilation. We need to look at fresh air purifiers. These devices come with a duck that sucks outside air, purifies it, throws it inside and sucks out inside air,"" said Bansal. ""Even if the air pollution outside is severe, do not stay locked in for long. It is always advisable to open the windows in every three hours. We need air to circulate as it is more than just the pollution,"" added Gupta.   For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Shortage of masks hits fight against toxic air,"Lucknow: Shrouded in toxic haze, the city is bearing the brunt of acute shortage of anti-pollution masks N95 and N90 which can filter 90-95% of pollutants in the air. Left high and dry, people are forced to buy ordinary masks which cannot filter PM10 and PM 2.5, the deadly superfine particles whose concentration has been found to be very high in the city air.Medical stores in Chowk, Hazratganj, Lalbagh, Kaiserbagh and Aminabad have already exhausted their stock and distributors said the fresh supply is expected only after few days. Veeru Pajapati, a bronchitis patient, has been shuttling between medical stores in search of N95 mask but in vain. /""I have been experiencing chest discomfort and shortness of breath... Despite running from pillar to post, I have not found a single N95 mask,"" Prajapati said. The demand for air filtration masks has gone up, said Vikash Amal Sinha, a Lalbagh-based distributor. ""We sold only 250 masks of N95 and N90 a day last week. Now, there is a jump of 50% in demand.""He said: ""The supply has been affected since most of the companies are in Delhi, where air pollution has reached its hazardous level... Since the demand for anti-pollution masks has hit the roof in the national capital, companies are giving priority to local distributors.""Ravi Bharti, a medical store owner in Hazratganj, said: ""We have sold 60 pieces of N90 masks in just three days. Our order for 200 more masks may take at least a week to arrive.""""We had a stock of 400 pieces as demand remains low throughout the year since they cost about three times more than reusable anti-dust masks. But in the past three days, all masks have been sold off,"" said Yatin Malik, a distributor in Aminabad. Unable to find them in stores, people have started buying these masks online. ""Since my father is asthmatic, we ordered it online after we failed to get it from local medical stores,"" Nikhil Singh, a resident of Hazratganj. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'City just behind Delhi in PM10 pollution',"Ahmedabad: While the nation discusses the dropping air quality index in Delhi, here's a reminder for the city - against Delhi's average annual PM2.5 concentration of 101 micrograms per cubic metres (g/m3) of air, the city was having concentration of 70 which was higher than Mumbai's 60 and Pune's 47 for the year 2017.It was one of the findings in the paper 'On processes controlling fine particulate matters in four Indian mega cities' by Vrinda Anand, Nikhil Korhale, Aditi Rathod and Gufran Beig, published in 'Environmental Pollution' recently. It analyzed air quality of Ahmedabad, Delhi, Mumbai and Pune based on data collected by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) network during 2017.The analysis also revealed that in terms of PM10 accumulation, Ahmedabad was just behind Delhi's 200g/m3 with 126 which was higher than Mumbai's 99 and Pune's 87. The report highlighted that respiratory ailments are the major health risk due to inhalation of the particulate matter (PM). The fine particulate air pollution which is common to metropolitan areas is also an important risk factor for cardiopulmonary diseases. For Ahmedabad, the researchers observed that due to high temperature and frequent dust storm coupled with the geographic location, levels of particulate matters get elevated even during summer. /As temperature do not fall significantly during winter, the boundary layer remains elevated and prevent pollution to get trapped, reducing impact of winter.Dr Gufran Beig, project director for SAFAR initiative, was not available for his comment. City-based pulmonologist said that in past few years, air quality has dropped in the city, reflected by the rise in lung and respiratory disorders. Dr Gopal Rawal, a city-based pulmonologist, said that children and elderly are at high risk of getting the disorders. ""The particulate matters are studied as they get accumulated in our body due to their size and wreak havoc. Prevention is surely better than cure but for that, the city's air quality needs improvement,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Odd-even 3.0: Why it may not mitigate Delhi pollution,"NEW DELHI: The third version of odd-even road-rationing scheme got off on November 4 when pollution level in Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) touched its worst levels due to stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. It is time to revisit the earlier two versions of the rule in order to find out the impact the current is likely to have on mitigating toxicity in the atmosphere. Odd-even formula was introduced for the first time between January 1 and 15, 2016. It was reintroduced between April 15 and 30 the same year.The first version of the odd-even rule was also implemented under similar circumstances.The Delhi High Court made an observation on December 3, 2015 that air pollution levels in the national capital had reached ""alarming"" proportions. It further said living in Delhi was akin to ""living in a gas chamber"".The very next day, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government led by Arvind Kejriwal decided to implement the odd-even scheme. /Odd-even 1.0 was enforced in Delhi from January 1 to 30, 2016.With this, Delhi joined the league of cities such as Beijing, Mexico City, Santiago, Chile, Sao Paulo, Costa Rica, Honduras, Bolivia and Paris which had implemented the odd-even scheme.The people lent their full support to the Arvind Kejriwal government in ensuring that the scheme, which had been implemented for the very first time, became a success.The Kejriwal government also patted its back claiming that the odd-even scheme was a grand success and he thanked the people for their support by following it.However, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee's data for the fortnight said the capital's air quality remained ""hazardous"" or ""very unhealthy"" on most of the days between January 1 and 15.Its data showed that the concentration of Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) in the said period was hardly encouraging. The highest PM2.5 recorded on January 1, 2016 was 276 and the highest in the first week was recorded on January 6 (484). In the second week, the highest PM2.5 was recorded on January 13 (431).Odd-even 2.0 was implemented from April 15 to 30 the same year. However, unlike in January, the schools were closed in April.Moreover, the Delhi government seized the school buses and used them for plying commuters. This took away considerable load off the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses and Delhi Metro.The end result of the second odd-even scheme was worse than the first one. It not just failed to reduce the pollution levels but it also failed to decongest the roads.A large number of commuters ignored the road rationing scheme right from the first working day. Delhi-NCR witnessed such congestion for the first time on an odd-even day since January.While the general public was highly inconvenienced, the auto-rickshaws, taxis and cabs had field days during the two vehicle-rationing fortnights. They over-charged the hapless commuters.In a tweet, Arvind Kejriwal himself said he had received some complaints against Ola and Uber for charging surge prices. He said his government was planning strong action against them.On the next day, he said strict action, including cancellation of permits and impounding of vehicles, would be resorted to against the taxis which charged rates more than what the government had prescribed.A few months before Delhi assembly election is held, the Kejriwal government has implemented odd-even 3.0 even though there is no consensus on the positive impact, if any, on the earlier two exercises.This year, Delhi-NCR has been witnessing smoke and low visibility since the last week of October because of the farmers of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi burning stubbles in large quantities.In such circumstances, it remains to be seen whether odd-even 3.0 yields the desired result.

City chokes as air quality falls to 'poor' category,"Ludhiana: A day after the Air Quality Index (AQI) was measured at 337, the same was dropped by more than 100 points. However, air quality in Ludhiana continued to be in ""poor"" bracket.As per the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) bulletin on Monday, the city witnessed AQI value of 224 which is 113 points less than a day before. The AQI value of the city comes under ""poor"" category with possible health impact on breathing discomfort to people with prolonged exposure.As per the CPCB pollution monitoring system, an average PM 2.5 (pollution particles which cause respiratory problems) value in the city was recorded at 224 and the maximum value for the same was witnessed at 334.As the AQI value for the city witnessed a massive fall on Monday, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials said the air quality was expected to improve.""The air was static for the last many days and resulted in high AQI value has now been blown away by the winds on Monday morning due to which the AQI level has witnessed a decline. As rain is expected in the next few days, we expect the air quality to improve further as it is likely to wash away the pollutants,"" said Sandeep Behl, PPCB official in Ludhiana.He said last year too wind had dispersed the pollutants and rain washed away the same.The Met department has predicted rain in the coming days.""The wind that recycled the air is a part of western disturbance that is arriving in the city. /It improved the visibility in the city. There are chances of light to moderate rainfall on November 6, 7 and 8 which is expected to improve the visibility further,"" said Surender Paul, director, Met department, Chandigarh.He said temperatures were expected to fall after November 8. City residents were happy to see decrease in pollution.""Ludhiana had turned into a gas chamber because of high pollution levels and it was posing a serious health risk, but things have changed for better after the breeze blew in the morning. If it rains, it will clean the air and reduce the risk of diseases,"" said Ravi Kumar, a trader of Pakhowal Road.On the other hand, with stubble burning going on in various areas of the district, the Air Quality Index (AQI), which measures air pollution is a combination of many pollutants, including respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and sulphur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, benzene and xylene, has suggested that the air quality in the city has become poor since last week.As per the data of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the AQI in Ludhiana measured at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) observatory on November 3 was recorded at a whopping 337 which comes under very poor category with possible impact on the respiratory health of humans after prolonged exposure.On November 2, the AQI for Ludhiana was 305 which again comes under the same bracket, whereas on November 1, it was 297 which comes under poor category with possible health impact leading to breathing discomfort to people after prolonged exposure.Even as the pollution level in the city continues to be high, data for stubble burning incidents show that the number of such incidents is more this year in comparison to the last year. As per the PPCB report based on the satellite data, the number of active fire incidents (kharif season) till November 3 this year has been 833, whereas the number of such incidents last year till the same date was just 589. The data has raised questions on the working of teams of various departments, including the PPCB, revenue, police, health, agriculture etc, to check stubble burning by farmers.Satwinder Marwaha, chairman of the PPCB, said their teams were making efforts to check such incidents and were motivating farmers to give up the practice. He said the teams had also challaned farmers for burning stubble.Dr Brijendra Pateriya, director, Punjab Remote Sensing Application Centre, said about 80% of the stubble burning incidents were recorded from October 24 to October 31. And now, less number of incidents was being recorded by satellites.He said by the end of the harvesting season around November 10, stubble burning incidents might be recorded below 900.Green activists said the authorities concerned did not seem to do much on stubble burning which posed a health risk.""The government doesn't seem to have a clear and efficient strategy to tackle the problem which is evident from the fact that many such incidents are being witnessed in large numbers. Apart from providing cheap and practical solution to farmers for disposal of stubble, the government needs to provide them minimum amount to manage stubble and not burn it,"" said Amandeep Singh, a green activist.Farmers have expressed helplessness in dealing with stubble due to high transportation cost.""Who will want to add to the miseries of people, including our own families, who have to suffer because of pollution due to stubble burning. We do not have any option other than burning stubble as management of the crop residue will add to our expenses and burden us. We feel helpless at this time every year. We want the Centre and the state governments to provide us cost of transportation or lift stubble from our fields so that we do not burn it, but this will never happen,"" said a farmer of Halwara area whose son and daughter face respiratory problems during the harvesting season. SMO at Jagraon Civil Hospital, Dr Sukhjiwan Kakkar, said because of air pollution they had to admit five patients, mostly elderly, and had to either put them on oxygen supply or nebulize them.He said apart from the respiratory problems, patients also complained of eye and skin infections during this season.

"Delhi pollutants' next stop could be Hyderabad, warn experts","HYDERABAD: Haze and pollution that has set the alarm bells ringing in the capital is likely to make its way down south, hitting the eastern coast first and then spreading to major cities, including Hyderabad, experts warned on Monday./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/Analysts involved with geographic information system (GIS) mapping and climate change warn that the current wind direction - which is 'boomerang' shaped across the country - could bring pollutants closer home.Speaking about the threat, Pradeep Macharla, who has been doing GIS mapping for years, said: ""Real-time data shows how pollutants from the north will impact southern cities, including Hyderabad in the next few days.""Macharla used data from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) and conflated this with AirVisual Earth's real-time, 3D pollution data. The result is a map that shows pollutants from 'hotspots' - created due to stubble burning - spread through the country. Pollutants travelling faster include particulate matter under 2.5 microns (PM2.5) which are lighter by nature.Elaborating on his model, he said, ""Entire east coast and south will continue receiving polluted air from northern India, caused by stubble burning, and will be the cause of increased PM 2.5 levels besides local pollution. Expect hazy skies this week across southeast India.""His analysis is buttressed by similar models doing the rounds on Twitter by experts across the country. Raj Bhagat Palanichamy (@rajbhagatt), who describes himself as earth observer, tweeted on Sunday: ""It's not just #Delhi, most of India is hit by #AirPollution crisis. Dispersion Models suggest that the plume is travelling across India (in east coast too). It's a #NationalHealthCrisis!"" His source was the System for Integrated modelling of Atmospheric composition (SILAS Asia).Hyderabad-based environmental experts further the argument that pollution from the north can travel long distances before it settles, especially those that are 'lighter' rise higher into the atmosphere.Sagar Dhara, who has been spearheading the fight against climate change, said, ""Pollutants that enter the upper air can travel at speeds of 50-100km/hr. Research has shown that PM2.5, Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, can travel as far as 3,000km."" He said that wind patterns at this time of the year would help the movement of pollutants and the ""north to south spread is a reality"". For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Track the pollution level in your city,Pollution check steps not implemented yet,"PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar issued a slew of directives on Monday to curb air pollution in Patna. TOI on Tuesday conducted a reality check on the implementation of various decisions taken by the government to curb air pollution, like prohibiting sale and use of kerosene in autorickshaws, covering construction sites and materials during transportation, ban on diesel generator sets and sprinkling of water on roads. Sprinkling water on roads: Water was seen being sprinkled by Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) tanker between Gandhi Chowk (Mahendru) and Tripolia on Ashok Rajapth. /But it was not seen anywhere in the city, including Gandhi Maidan, Boring Road, Boring Canal Road, Bailey Road and Jagdeopath among others. PMC public relations officer SK Mishra said the civic body has only one water sprinkling machine. ""We will sprinkle water on all major routes, including between Tripolia and Patna City, on Wednesday,"" he said.Covering construction materials: Construction materials for private or government projects were seen being transported without any cover in several areas. Heaps of construction material were seen at Gandhi Maidan, Ashok Rajpath, Fraser Road and Exhibition Road. Road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav told this newspaper over phone from Ranchi that construction firms have been instructed to sprinkle water near the ongoing projects and cover construction material while during transportation.Diesel generator sets: Old diesel generator sets, which emit black smoke, were being used at several commercial and industrial sites, pump houses, flats and jugad gadi. According to Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), diesel generator sets contribute around 5% to air pollution. Patna DM Kumar Ravi said instructions were issued to the officials concerned to prohibit the use of diesel generator sets. ""The administration will launch awareness drive within a week against jugad gadi, sugar cane juice carts and commercial establishments using old and noisy generators sets. Action will be taken against the violators,"" he said.Kerosene mixed with petrol: The sale of kerosene-mixed petrol to autorickshaws was seen unabated on Vidyapati Marg. Thick black smoke is released by autorickshaws using such fuel and aggravates air pollution. One of the sellers said: ""Are you trying to shut our business?"" Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said raids will be conducted this week on places where kerosene-mixed petrol is being sold to autorickshaw drivers. ""Autorickshaws using such fuel will have to pay fine and their vehicles will be seized,"" he said.Covering construction sites: Most of the construction sites in the city were not covered to prevent spread of dust particles. The cover, mostly a green net, prevents dust from spreading to nearby areas. After the CM's instructions in this regard, few builders started using the green cover. BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh said around 7% of the most harmful pollutants come from construction sites and 4% from brick kilns. ""Instructions have been issued to brick kiln owners to use non-polluting technology,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Labs offer packages to check how you're coping with bad air,"New Delhi: The rise in the pollution levels in Delhi-NCR has opened up the market for a range of products and services like air purifiers, masks, and potted plants that claim to help deal with the crisis.Now, lab chains like SRL diagnostics are offering 'pollution test packages' that claims to check the readiness of one's body against pollution.A spokesperson of the laboratory chain said they are offering four packages starting from Rs 1,699.The basic 'pollution care' package conducts tests like glucose fasting, CBC, ESR, Vitamin D, Pulmonary function tests and ECG, whereas the advanced package will include creatinine serum, lipid profile, hs-CRP tests and an advanced allergy screening test as well.Prolonged exposure to high levels of air pollution is known to increase the risk of ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and acute lower respiratory infections in children. The SRL spokesperson said simple tests to assess the vital parameters can help understand how prepared our bodies are to face pollution and added that the tests are ideal for individuals with low immunity, allergies, and respiratory disorders and will guide them if they need any further precautions or treatment.Another wellness centre based in Gurgaon is offering hyperbaric oxygen therapy. In this therapy, people are made to breathe pure oxygen in a pressurised room, allowing oxygen to diffuse more effectively in the blood, which repairs the tissue and restores its normal functions.""Oxygen-rich blood helps fight infections and triggers stem cells that stimulate and sustain healing,"" claimed Dr Alok Chopra, medical director, Daivam Wellness. /He added that the number of persons seeking the therapy has gone up significantly over the last few days.

Farmers protest Shamli admin's fine on 30 farmers for burning stubble,"Muzaffarnagar: Farmers in Muzaffarnagar sat on protest after 30 farmers of Shamli were slapped with a fine of Rs 2,500 each on Tuesday, for burning stubble in their farms. Meanwhile, the district administration has also slapped fines on 12 locals for burning garbage.According to sources, so far in Shamli district, penalty orders have been issued to 30 farmers, even as the drive to identify farms where stubble is being burned continues. Additional district magistrate of Shamli, Arvind Kumar Singh, said, ""To ensure no one burns stubble in their farms, we're conducting a drive. /Whenever we receive a complaint, we act swiftly. So far, 30 farmers have been penalised for burning stubble.""On hearing that farmers are penalised, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) members slammed the administration. BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said, ""Government bodies are misleading people that farmers are behind the rise in air pollution, and imposing penalties on us. The government should convene a meeting with farmers and solve the problem of burning crop waste."" The farmers protesting in Muzaffarnagar warned the Shamli administration to stop harassing farmers. BKU member Dhiraj Latiyan said, ""Why is all the blame for rising air pollution being imposed on farmers? There are countless factories and mills releasing smoke and poisoning the environment. If farmers can't burn crop waste on their fields, allow us to burn it at government offices.""Meanwhile, Muzaffarnagar administration identified a dozen locals who have burnt garbage in the city, and slapped fines on them. Magistrate Atul Kumar said, ""Twelve people who were caught burning garbage in the city, were slapped with penalties. We recovered Rs 22,000 from them.

Decades of research on pollution under one roof,"New Delhi: Indian Air quality Interactive Repository or IndAIR, CSIR-Neeri's web facility that was launched on Wednesday, has archived approximately 700 scanned materials from pre-internet era, 1,215 research articles, 170 reports and case studies, 100 cases and over 2,000 statutes to provide the history of air pollution research and legislation in the country.Though air pollution is a widely deliberated issue, not much is known about its history or statistics, said Rakesh Kumar, director of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri). ""We began IndAIR to document important milestones in the country and make them available to the public. We hope it will not only help the academicians but also enable policy-makers to frame legislations,"" he added.S P S Parihar, head of pollution watchdog CPCB, said the website would be a useful platform for the scientific community to share its current work and exchange ideas. The repository, one of the few such facilities in the world, has the maximum number of studies - 262 - concerning Delhi-NCR. /IndAIR reveals air pollution was recognised as a subject in India even in 1905, when a study was carried out for Bengal Smoking Nuisance Act. The website showcases how discussions on the ills of air pollution began wholeheartedly in the 70s, while studies were undertaken as early as the 50s.The studies by S C Roy of the meteorological office detailed on cloud seeding to deal with famine-ridden areas in 1954, while short-term studies on air quality in Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Kanpur were authored by Neeri researchers. P K Zutshi of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre also authored a 'Perspective on Current Air Pollution Problems' to help develop a course of action to combat the problem.

Breathing city air equal to smoking 9.5 cigarettes: Research,"PATNA: The state capital is struggling with serious pollution problem and the residents commuting on streets are inhaling smoke equivalent to 9.5 cigarettes per day.A research by a California-based agency states that inhaling smoke from one cigarette is equivalent to breathing air containing 22 micrograms per cubic meter of PM 2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns). Accordingly, an individual breathing air on busy streets in Patna on Tuesday, when the average PM2.5 level was 280.15 micrograms per cubic meter, inhaled the smoke equivalent to smoking around 9.5 cigarettes.The average PM2.5 level in Patna on Tuesday was 280.15 at the monitoring station on Indira Gandhi Science Complex (ISGC) premises. It was more than four times of the prescribed limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre of PM2.5 per day.Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh attributes it to the rampant burning of crackers during Diwali. ""It added to the woes of people who were already facing higher level of Air Quality Index (AQI) due to vehicular emission from old three-wheelers and outdated cars,"" he said and added: ""However, residents should not panic as the AQI level is still better in residential colonies and low-traffic areas. /The low velocity of wind is not letting dust particles and other pollutants disburse. Nonetheless, people should wear masks to avoid breathing issues.""Meanwhile, residents are complaining of breathing and respiratory problems. ""For an asthma patient, the condition has become severe. I got two asthmatic attacks on Monday. I have even installed air purifier at home,"" said Yash Sharma of Bailey Road area.Many parents are also worried about their kids going to schools. ""My daughter uses autorickshaw for going to school and coming back home. She has been constantly complaining about breathing issues for the last two days,"" said Priyanka Shrivastava of Rajendra Nagar.Doctors and specialists also claimed an increase in pulmonary patients in the city owing to severe air pollution. Sanjay Kumar, a chest specialist, said the number of patients suffering from breathing and respiratory problems has considerably increased. ""We have been receiving huge numbers of allergic and asthma patients. The patients have increased from average 200 per month to 400-500 this month."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Predictions on farm fire share inconclusive',"New Delhi: Recent predictions regarding share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 concentrations are not foolproof, a CSIR-NEERI expert has claimed. The Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) has been making predictions regarding the share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution a day in advance. However, according to the Delhi chapter head of the CSIR-National Environment Engineering Institute, Dr SK Goyal, such predictions are inconclusive.""These predictions are made even before the activity takes place. /Stubble burning is not a concentrated activity which takes place at the same spot. It takes place in a huge area, and is not a continuous source. I don't know what is the basis of the predictions regarding its share in Delhi's pollution, and to what extent can the factors like the exact spots and timings of the fires and their impact can be validated, "" the scientist questioned at a panel discussion held during the launch of India's first web repository documenting air quality studies done in the last 60 years.SAFAR collects data on crop burning from satellite images, and then creates emissions inventory using GIS-based system. ""It is the lone source of data, which forms the basis of our analysis and understanding. We have to do scientific analysis using different techniques like source-based monitoring, remote sensing data analysis and dispersion modelling. All the tools and techniques have to converge to come out with a particular solution,"" the NEERI expert added.During the discussion, Dr Arun Kumar Sharma of UCMS, said that definite micro-level studies are required to ascertain the impact of pollution on people, especially in the hotspots of the city.""Do we really know what air pollution is doing to our health? It is definitely detrimental to our well-being, but what appears in the news makes us more worried than concerned. Of late there has been a trend of blaming air pollution for cardiovascular diseases, miscarriages, cognitive disorders and neurological behavioural disorders. There should be an integrated, interdisciplinary, multipronged approach to understand and decipher the composition of each risk factors to these maladies,"" Sharma, who has been conducting a study in the city to find the impact of air pollution in high-pollution areas, said. When contacted, SAFAR, however, said prediction always has a degree of uncertainty. ""Our system is foolproof. Today's stubble burning's impact is felt in Delhi-NCR region tomorrow. However, the daily estimate is never wrong. Wind speeds and directions are also dynamic factors which many times ensure change in stubble burning impact."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Patna air quality worsens further, residents in danger","Patna: Local residents continue to have harrowing experience of air pollution as Patna recorded the worst air quality of the season on Tuesday. The Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city was 414 on Tuesday, which was third highest in the country, after Kanpur (456) and Lucknow (416). The AQI breached the 400 mark after a gap of only one day. The AQI level of the city was 413 on Sunday, which prompted CM Nitish Kumar to convene a high-level meeting on Monday. Incidentally, the air quality improved slightly on Monday as it was recorded at 382.As per the norms of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), AQI level of 400 and above falls in ""severe"" category, which can affect healthy people and seriously impact those suffering from various diseases.The air quality deteriorated at Muzaffarpur also as the AQI plunged from 369 on Sunday and Monday to 385 on Tuesday. /As per the daily bulletin issued by CPCB, the air quality in Patna has been in the category of ""very poor"" for over a week now, which can cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure.Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB)'s chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh attributed the deterioration of air quality in the city on Tuesday to increase in the number of vehicles following return of people from different districts after Chhath festival.""The number of vehicles on the streets was comparatively higher on Tuesday as many people returned to the city on Monday after Chhath festival. As people ventured out on the streets to go to their workplace and educational institutions, it led to increase in the movement of vehicles. We have already said that vehicular emission contributes 32% of total air- pollution in Patna, thus worsening of air quality was bound to happen,"" Ghosh told TOI, adding local weather factors are also responsible for poor air quality in the city. The BSPCB chairman also cautioned people with history of respiratory illness to take precautionary measures in case of prolonged exposure to outdoor air in busy commercial roads. ""People with heart and lungs related disorders are advised to wear masks in case they are out on busy roads for several hours,"" he said. Deliberating on how weather factors are adding to air pollution woes in the city, India Meteorological Society (Patna chapter) secretary Pradhan Parth Sarthisaid: ""The pollutants spread during Diwali and Chhath festivals are trapped in the cooler air in the lower level of atmosphere, while the comparatively hotter air is acting as lid or blanket in the middle level of atmosphere. The wind speed is quite low, around 3-6kmph, which is preventing disbursement of pollutants. The situation is likely to remain the same or it can even worsen with gradual onset of winter conditions; unless the wind speed increases."" The AQI of Patna is in ""very poor"" category after Diwali and it crossed 400 mark on last Sunday. However, the BSPCB chairman was hopeful of slight improvement in the air quality in a few days.""The implementation of instructions issued by the CM, including sprinkling of water on streets, phasing out vehicles older than 15 years old and strict check on fitness of commercial three-wheelers among others, is likely to start from Wednesday. Accordingly, we expect the air quality will improve slightly, but any drastic improvement is unlikely due to different factors, including geographical location of Patna,"" Ghosh said.

Two units using coal as fuel sealed,"Gurgaon: The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) on Tuesday sealed two ""polluting"" factories in Pataudi after they were found using coal as fuel.During a raid, a team of HSPCB officials found that the two units were using coal and mustard husk as fuel for a boiler with a capacity of 10 tonnes of steam per hour (TPH) each. One THP means that the boiler can produce one tonne of steam per hour under standard operating conditions, an official said, adding that plumes of smoke from the chimneys of the units had been continuously discharging toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.The move comes after the board conducted raids following an Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) order for closure of all coal and other fuel-based industries in Gurgaon, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Noida, Bahadurgarh, Bhiwadi, Greater Noida, Sonepat, Panipat till the morning of November 5. As per the EPCA order, no person can establish or operate any industrial plant in any air pollution-controlled area without the consent of HSPCB. The board had on Monday ordered all coal and other fuel-based industries which have not shifted to natural gas or agro-residue to remain closed in Gurgaon. /EPCA has directed to take up all cases of non-compliance immediately with stringent enforcement of rules. HSPCB is closely monitoring polluting units in the area, officials said. ""We are in the process of conducting more raids in the city, especially in industrial areas. We already have issued notices to all hot-mix industries to shut down till further orders. These units discharge toxic gases into the atmosphere, which gets trapped because of the low wind pressure,"" the official said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Delhiites extend Diwali vacations to escape gas chamber,"With public health emergency declared in the capital as air quality is worsening, some Delhiites have opted to take an extended holiday from work, college and school to stay away from the city during this period. While for some, Diwali holidays have been extended, others decided to extend their short trips outside of Delhi.'Decided to extend our holidays because of daughter's asthma'Gautami Chettri, a resident of Vasant Kunj visits her native home back in Shimla with family every year for Diwali. Similarly this year, she was in Shimla on Diwali and was planning to be back in town by Tuesday night. However, after reports of air quality dropping in Delhi started emerging from Monday itself, she decided to stay back.""My 13-year-old daughter suffers from mild persistent asthma and after hearing reports of AQI in Delhi reaching 700 on Diwali night, we did not want to take a risk by going back. /My husband has left for Delhi since he has office, but my daughter has taken leave from school and I have taken work from home. If the situation doesn't get better by next Monday, we may have to take another 5-day leave,"" says Gautami, who works at a consultancy firm in Gurgaon.Clear skies in Shimla 'Was visiting home till Diwali but have extended for 15 days now'Some students who were visiting home during Diwali have also extended their leave owing to the severe air pollution in NCR. ""I had gone to my home in Guwahati on Friday night and was supposed to come back by Tuesday night. I have now decided to extend the leave as my parents asked me to stay back after watching the news about Delhi's pollution,"" says Priya Saikia, a student of Indraprastha College for Women, Delhi University who stays in Mukherjee Nagar. She adds, ""We also have exam preparation leaves from November 16 so there is no point coming for just two weeks in such bad air"".Neha Jha, student of a private university in Noida, cancelled her flight from Indore to Delhi after learning about the pollution statistics of the capital. ""Last year when I was in the city during Diwali, I fell sick with sore throat and had trouble breathing. This year, I don't want a repeat of that and decided to cancel my flight which was earlier scheduled for Wednesday. I thought three days after Diwali will be enough time for air to get clearer but I was wrong. I will only book the flight once air is better in Delhi,"" says Neha, who is a resident of Sector 46. Clear, blue sky in Nepal'Had planned a three day vacation after Diwali but extended it for 10 days'Vishal Kumar, a resident of Shalimar Garden had planned a three-day vacation to Chopta in Uttarakhand after Diwali but decided to stay back after reports of severe pollution in the capital.""My brother and I came to Chopta a day after Diwali and were planning to go back by Wednesday. However, after we came here, we realized we were missing the fresh air. Moreover, since air quality has severely deteriorated back home, we have decided to take another 10 days off from work,"" says Vishal, who works at a travel firm in Connaught Place.Aparna Thilakan, a resident of Noida who works at an IT firm in Sector 126, planned a 10-day trip to her hometown Thrissur, Kerala after falling ill the next day of Diwali.""I fell sick the morning after Diwali because of smoke in the air. I took a two-day leave from work but my doctor suggested I leave the city for a few days before my health worsens. So I took a flight to my hometown and leave from office till November 10,"" says Aparna. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Lung cancer rising in women, non-smokers","Hyderabad: Pulmonologists have pointed out that the city is seeing a rise in number of lung cancer cases among women and non-smokers. Experts have attributed this worrying trend to air pollution, second-hand smoking and other environmental factors. /""According to our recent findings, 30 of 100 patients belong to the younger-than-30 age group, and of those 30, nearly 49% are non-smokers,"" said KIMS Hospitals consultant pulmonologist, Dr V V Ramana Prasad.""The male-to-female ratio  is also significantly changing, indicating a steep rise in the proportion of female patients as compared to studies in the past. Earlier studies had reported a much lower incidence of the disease in females,"" Dr Prasad said.Experts have also mentioned tertiary smoking as a factor affecting people who have never smoked. ""Toxic residue lingers on indoor surfaces and in dust long after a cigarette has been extinguished. Most are carcinogenic. Such particles settle in our surrounding objects, like car interiors, plants and can reach human bodies via touch,"" said director of state-run MNJ Cancer Hospital, Dr Jayalatha Nethagani.Another factor leading to an alarming rise in number of lung cancer patients is the long exposure to poor quality of air. ""There is an urgent need for a more robust data collection for lung cancer in the country, with immediate measures to work towards early detection, smoking cessation and controlling both outdoor as well as indoor air pollution,"" said Dr Mallu Gangadhar Reddy, senior pulmonologist at Yashodha Hospitals.

Taking a deep breath in Chennai? Think again,"CHENNAI: Believe it or not, but morning runs or a game of tennis can make more people sick as Chennai's air pollution is nearly at its peak at 5am. Monitoring units show particulate matter (PM2.5) levels hovering between 225 and 287 micrograms per cubic metre -- six times more than the city's average.Most doctors encourage morning walkers and pet owners to continue their brisk walks and strolls, they warn against intense activities for more than 15 minutes as benefits from the exercise will be nullified by the polluted air. ""Walking for about 45 minutes will still have its health benefits. /But when you do intense exercise that makes you gasp, you open your mouth for air,"" said senior pulmonologist Dr Raj B Singh at the Apollo Hospitals. ""When you take in more of polluted air, it enters your lungs and your blood stream,"" he said.Among a series of health problems, air pollution causes respiratory disorders, affects metabolic system (pushes up sugar levels) and results in low birth weight. Studies have shown that when levels of pollution spike, so does the number of deaths, including those from heart failure, asthma and lung diseases. Pollution also raises the risk of depression, bipolar disorder and blindness.The air quality monitoring equipments monitored by agencies such as state and central pollution control boards have revealed that PM2.5 levels are alarmingly high across several areas of the city. Throughout the day, pollution monitors have been indicating red alerts in most zones and doctors say it is best to keep intense physical activities indoors besides avoiding prolonged hours outside. ""Health conscious people who have been exercising in the morning are complaining of itchy eyes, cough, tightness or heaviness of chest. These are indications that the haze outside is getting into your system. I ask them to get back home,"" said Dr Singh.While special masks can block some air, there is no foolproof method to beat air pollution. And pollutants inhaled stay in. ""End the walk with a round of saltwater gargling. Repeat two to three times a day to keep the passageway moist and reduce inflammation because of pollution,"" said Dr K Rajkumar, consultant pulmonologist, Fortis Malar Hospital. ""Also pranayama can be very helpful as it helps to eliminate any mucous in the lungs.""Particulate matter can also cause dryness of respiratory tract leading to inflammation, cough and mucous production, says Dr Rajkumar. ""This will lead to infections. It also leads to sleep apnoea. Mask containing activated carbon cloth helps. But these masks don't cut off pollutants completely,"" he said.It also complicates disorders such as diabetes, said Dr V Mohan of the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation. Air pollution, he said, is now recognized as a novel risk factor for both insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. ""When we are exposed to pollution, it enters the blood vessels where it becomes an endocrine poison. They are referred to as endocrine disrupters. If they reach the pancreas they can destroy the beta cells and harm insulin production."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Follow Guru Nanak's teachings on conserving nature: Naidu, Captain","CHANDIGARH: Vice-president Venkaiah Naidu and Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh underlined the issue of pollution by recalling Guru Nanak's ideology 'Pawan Guru, Pani Pita, Mata Dharat Mahat' (air is the guru, water the father and earth the mother), at the special session of Punjab assembly to commemorate the 550th birth anniversary of the first Sikh Guru. Both of them referred to Guru's ideology to highlight the intrinsic bond shared between nature and mankind.

City air pollution more than five times the daily limit,"PATNA: Come winter and poor air quality haunts people in Patna, considered one of the most polluted cities in India. Though residents heaved a sigh of relief on Wednesday as the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city dropped from 414 on Tuesday to 317, primarily due to higher wind speed, the respite may not last longer as Patna is infamous for poor air quality in the peak winter months of November to January. TOI tries to figure out the causes and effects of such an alarming situation in the city and what can be done to check it:How polluted is the city air?As per the standards of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), air in Patna has remained in the ""very poor"" category ever since Diwali and in ""severe"" category on last Sunday and Tuesday. /The CPCB stipulates that ""very poor"" air quality can lead to respiratory illness on prolonged exposure and ""severe"" air quality can affect healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases.How high is air pollution over the daily limit?Very high. The level of PM.2.5 fine particulate matter that invades the lungs and triggers respiratory diseases and cancer was measured at 309 micrograms per cubic meter in Patna on Wednesday. It was more than five times the daily limit (60 micrograms per cubic meter).What are the factors responsible for it?As per recent assessment by Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), the major sources of air pollution are vehicle emission (32%), construction work (7%), brick kiln (4%), sand mining (12%), burning of garbage (7%), cooking fire (6%) and heating (10%).Is geographical location of Patna also to be blamed? BSPCB chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh said it is most unlikely that air quality in Patna can come in the category of ""good"" or ""satisfactory"". ""States like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are prone to dust particles as they are situated in the Himalayan terrai region and planes of the Ganga. Around three-fourth of the soil in Bihar is alluvial, which has formed due to formation of the Himalayas. Besides, the location of Patna along the bank of Ganga also leads to formation of alluvial soil. All such factors taken together have made the soil soft and prone to formation of dust.Are weather factors also responsible for deterioration of air quality?According to Pradhan Parth Sarthi, secretary at Patna chapter of India Meteorological Society, meteorological factors are presently unfavourable for disbursement of pollutants. ""High level of PM 2.5 (suspended particles less than 2.5 microns) or tiny soot-like particles in Patna settle in the cooler air and moisture in the lower level of atmosphere near the ground during winter. This leads to deterioration in air quality at surface level and even formation of smog. Only higher wind speed can improve the condition in such cases,"" he said.Which parts of Patna are more polluted?Busy thoroughfares and areas with more vehicular movement. Lanes in the inner residential colonies still have comparatively cleaner air. ""Places like Bailey Road and Boring Canal Road will have poor air quality as compared to residential colonies. This is basically due to fewer vehicles and their movement in the colonies. Vehicular emission is the biggest contributor to air pollution in Patna,"" BSPCB chairman said.How can people protect themselves?Wearing a mask while on the move helps, but it isn't effective when it comes to ultra fine particulates or gases. Experts have suggested to use N95 or N98 nasal masks, which prevent PM2.5 from being inhaled.What can people do to reduce air pollution in the city?According to Ghosh, small steps like ensuring proper maintenance and pollution check of vehicles, minimal use of vehicles, car pooling and plantation, including kitchen or terrace gardening as well a vermicomposting can help bring down pollution level.

"Rain lowers mercury, brings haze back","New Delhi: There was light rain in several parts of the capital on Thursday, leading to a maximum temperature of 23.4 degrees Celsius that was six degrees below normal for this time of the year. At 18.2 degrees Celsius, the minimum was, however, four notches above normal. The India Meteorological Department says Delhi is likely to see a spell of shallow-to-moderate fog on Friday, while a drop in the minimum temperature is expected after 48 hours .""Delhi is currently seeing easterly winds, but cold north-westerly winds will start blowing again after 48 hours. /This will bring the minimum temperature down to 14 degrees by Sunday,"" said Kuldeep Srivastava, an IMD scientist.According to the regional meteorological centre in Delhi, the Safdarjung observatory - considered the base for Delhi's weather - recorded 0.8mm rainfall till 5.30pm, while Lodhi Road, Ridge and Ayanagar received 0.7, 0.6 and 2mm, respectively. Palam recorded the highest rainfall in Delhi at 3.4mm. The relative humidity oscillated between 64% and 87% in the past 24 hours.Wind speed is likely to pick up from Friday afternoon touching 20-25km/hour, which will help in dispersal of pollutants, said Srivastava. ""Wind speed has again fallen to around 8-10km/hour, which makes things static. The relative humidity is also high, causing a further spike in air pollution,"" he added. While the minimum temperature at Safdarjung was 18.2 degrees Celsius, other stations recorded an even lower minimum temperature due to the rain. While it fell to 14.2 degrees Celsius at Ayanagar, the Lodhi Road station recorded the minimum at 16.4.The Met department had forecast the Thursday rain, citing an active western disturbance. According to IMD, the entire northern plain was influenced by it and the interaction of Cyclone Maha that weakened over the past 24 hours. ""We have also recorded a considerable drop in temperature and snowfall in the higher parts,"" said an official.The forecast for Friday shows a possibility of drizzle in some parts with moderate-to-shallow fog in the early hours. ""The maximum and minimum temperatures will be around 28 and 16 degrees Celsius,"" said the official. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air quality better, but still 'very poor'","PATNA: Air quality of Patna has improved but still remained in ""very poor"" category on Wednesday. The Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city came down from 414 on Tuesday to 317 on Wednesday.Officials at Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) attributed the improvement to increase in wind speed as well implementation of other measures mandated by the state government to curb pollution. ""Wind was blowing at an average speed of 6-10kmph on Wednesday, which was comparatively higher than on Tuesday. /The higher wind speed led to disbursement of pollutants, primarily dust particles. Besides, the crackdown by transport department on autorickshaws running on kerosene-mixed fuel led to reduction in pollution caused by such vehicles. People have also started putting cover on construction sites, which is also preventing the spread of dust particles,"" BSPCB chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh told TOI.The air quality of Patna is being recorded in the ""very poor"" category ever since Diwali and scaled even to above 400 mark on two days since Sunday. As per the norms of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), ""very poor"" air quality can lead to respiratory illness on prolonged exposure, while ""severe"" air quality can affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases.In the wake of air quality surging to 413 on Sunday, CM Nitish Kumar convened a meeting on Monday and issued directives to curb air pollution, including imposing ban on commercial vehicles more than 15 years old.The transport department is conducting spot fitness checking of commercial vehicles, especially autorickshaws and city service buses, from Tuesday.As per a statement issued by the transport department, total 52 vehicles were seized on the second day of the drive on Wednesday. Altogether 342 vehicles have been seized in two days for failing fitness check and 60 were fined for not complying with emission norms. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Kolkata air turns fouler than Delhi's,"Kolkata: The city's ambient air quality deteriorated from 'poor' on Tuesday to 'very poor' on Wednesday even as the air quality in Delhi displayed a marked improvement - moving up from 'very poor' to 'poor - in response to multiple measures. Kolkata woke up on Wednesday morning to find itself enveloped in a grey haze. So thick was the smog that hung over the city that the sun turned into a fleeble disc that resembled the moon. /With temperatures dipping sharply at night, thermal inversion that reduces vertical wind movement and prevents the pollutants in the lower strata of atmosphere from dispersing is already a major factor in the rapid deterioration of the city's air quality. At Ballygunge, the average AQI between 4am and 9am was well past the 400-mark, which is categorised as 'severe'. Even at Fort William, the Eastern Command HQ located in the Maidan that is the city's greenest zone, the AQI hovered above 400 for six hours. At Rabindra Sarobar, the AQI was above 300 all day before it dipped in the evening.By comparison, Delhi breathed easy on Wednesday with the overall AQI improving to 214 from 324 on Tuesday and 400+ on Monday. In Kolkata, the pollutant-laden air made breathing difficult for those with respiratory ailments. But as consultant pulmonologist Anup Haldar pointed out, the city's air was so foul that even the healthy would develop respiratory trouble. ""Since the AQI is PM2.5 driven, a healthy person can have respiratory illness on a prolonged exposure,"" said Haldar. The PM2.5 particles that have diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres (human hair is 100 micrometers thick and can pack in 40 PM2.5 particles across its width) travel straight into the blood stream through the lungs. With microscopic harmful chemical compounds piggybacking these particulate matter, PM2.5 is extremely dangerous to human health. The AQI slide prompted health experts to advise restrictions on outdoor activities, particularly morning walks. ""The pollution peaks in the morning. Most vulnerable are kids, elderly and people with respiratory disorder,"" warned Ajay Mittal of Kolkata Clean Air, which carries out extensive public awareness campaigns.Respiratory medicine expert Dr Anirban Saha confirmed a sharp rise in COPD cases in the past few days and felt the numbers would keep rising unless there were decisive actions to reduce the pollutants in the air. Green crusader Subhas Datta, who returned from Delhi on Monday after attending a National Green Tribunal hearing during which the Bengal government was asked to submit within four weeks a strategy to combat air pollution, said the state government needed to look at clean fuel options. ""Since vehicular pollution, particularly diesel exhaust, is one of the biggest sources of PM2.5 pollution in Kolkata, there is a growing demand for switch to cleaner fuel and cleaner technology. The government must immediately phase out diesel vehicles that are more than 10 years old as ordered by the NGT,"" he said.Though WBPCB had earlier prepared a comprehensive air quality management report, it is yet to be acted upon. Water-sprinklers handed to the civic body to bring down PM pollution at major intersections have been used only once this season.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Factory shut after pollution protest,"Haripal: A vax-setting factory at Hooghly's Haripal was shut on Thursday after 200 people protested against growing air pollution due to the factory. Locals complained of breathlessness, nausea, cough and other ailments. /They alleged that smoke from the factory not only polluted the air around Naikhal but also the area adjoining Borgachia. Locals further alleged that metal sheets are melted inside the factory with acid, which is used for casting work. The factory employed 50 people. The protesters blocked the Kolkata-Arambagh state highway on Wednesday, demanding action against the factory. Three people were injured after cops resorted to lathi-charge to disperse the protesters. Iman Kalyan Santra, a teacher, said: "" ""Cops asked us to hold a discussion with the administration at the Haripal BDO office. Accordingly, we went there on Thursday morning. Haripal BDO Tapan Haldar, additional SP Raj Narayan Mukherjee, factory owner Bikash Das and a delegation of locals met.""When the administration asked Das to show them papers in order to run the factory, he said he would show the papers later.  The BDO and others then asked him to keep the factory shut till he submits the papers.  Das said: ""I will not be able to run the factory in the face of such resistance.""

Nitish urged to get heavy air purifiers installed in cities,"PATNA: The members of AKN Sinha Institute, an educational wing of Indian Medical Association (IMA), on Thursday wrote a letter to chief minister Nitish Kumar and health minister Mangal Pandey demanding installation of heavy industry air purifiers in public places as well as in public transports in Patna as well as other cities of the state facing severe air pollution. The air purifiers can tap particles as small as 0.3 microns in size.IMA (Bihar chapter) senior vice-president and institute's executive secretary Dr Ajay Kumar said air purifiers have become a necessity in Patna to ensure sound health of residents. The institute has demanded such purifiers in areas like Patna Junction, around hospitals and places having more pollutants. /Referring to Delhi, Dr Ajay said, ""The Delhi government is in the process to install such public purifiers and we should also do it in Bihar.""The institute members in the letter have cited Article 21 of the Constitution and stated that the right to pollution-free air is every citizen's right, but the air quality of Patna is deteriorating every day. The IMA members said heavy purifiers can clean the air in three square km and one unit will cost around Rs1.75 crore. They also cited the example of world's biggest purifier installed at Xi'an in China. ""The 100-metre tall smog tower has the capacity to clean air in 10 square km area. It is high time to move in this direction,"" Dr Ajay said. Patna, Muzaffarpur and Gaya in Bihar are experiencing very poor air quality. Doctors have said the poor air quality with dust particles is leading to increase in the number of asthmatic cases as well as people suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

"Cold, cough, burning eyes: Kolkata artistes face the wrath of rising air pollution","The air quality in Kolkata has been a serious worry for city dwellers lately. The city's ambient air quality deteriorated from 'poor' on Tuesday to 'very poor' on Wednesday even as the air quality in Delhi displayed a marked improvement. On Wednesday morning, the entire city was enveloped in a grey haze. According to doctors, children and people with respiratory troubles are more vulnerable to illness caused by pollution. /However, despite the situation worsening by the day, it seems Kolkatans haven't yet started to take adequate measures to protect themselves from the wrath of pollution. Few people in the city are seen wearing special pollution masks. Even traffic police sergeants accepted that they use the safety of pollution masks only during peak traffic hours. One of them told us, ""It is important that we take proper precautions during peak hours. The department provides us with these masks.""However, there is not much alarm among the regular citizens. On being asked whether they would invest in air purifiers for themselves and their families, most people said that they had not given it a thought. A businessman, whose shop also sells air purifiers in the Chandni Chowk area, said, ""There is no rise in sales of air purifying masks. In fact, there is no sale at all.""As the menace continues to intensify, CT speaks to a few city artistes to understand how they are coping with air pollution. Here's what they have to say: 'Keeping indoor plants to purify air at my house'For me, my voice is what keeps me going professionally. But these days I'm always prone to cold and cough. I also feel choked and my eyes feel a burning sensation. Doctor told me that it is all a result of severe pollution. I'm gargling every night before hitting the bed and keeping indoor plants to purify air at my house. I'm sure there are thousands out there facing similar problems. It is surprising how despite this we still continue to burst crackers, cut down trees, expand real-estate constructions. It's high time we stopped and took some steps to protect the air we breathe. - Paran Bandopadhyay, actor'Feeling cold since Puja due to pollution'I'm usually known to have a high threshold for cold. I hardly wrap a shawl around even during peak winter months. But I have been experiencing something unusual this year. I started feeling cold right after Durga Puja. When I consulted a doctor, I was told that it's because of the high levels of pollution in the city. I'm also facing respiratory problems and feel choked at times. I'm having to use nasal drops every now and then. I have also bought a couple of scarves to keep my throat covered because I have become susceptible to cough and cold.  - Urmimala Basu, elocutionist'We all are responsible for pollution'Everyone is a victim of pollution. As a theatre personality, it may affect my throat more than anything else, for someone active in outdoor sports, their lungs may have issues and for others, there could be eye related problems. So, all of us are in danger and the most vulnerable are our children. It is our duty to find a solution to the growing menace of pollution. I think we all are responsible for this situation. We keep on constructing high-rises at the cost of our water bodies. All this have an adverse impact on the environment and add to pollution.

How to protect your skin from air pollution,"The skin has defensive mechanisms that help fight free radicals that exist in polluted air by secreting fats and oils called lipids that act as a barrier against these pollutants. To strengthen this mechanism, there are certain tips that one should follow to ward off skin diseases.CLEANSING THE SKIN: With high acidic levels in the air, the skin tends to get dry making it vulnerable to penetration of harmful particulates that are free flowing in the air. The skin needs to be kept moist therefore, using a gentle cleanser is a good option.USING A TONER: After cleansing the skin, it is essential to neutralise it with a good toner. /A gentle, soothing toner helps remove oil and traces of dirt and grime on the skin, ensuring there are no acidic particles left.SCRUBBING: Once the toner has been applied evenly, treat your skin to mild scrubbing. Mild scrubbing will ensure your skin is thoroughly cleansed of all the dirt.USING FACIAL OILS: Instead of using a moisturiser, facial oils prove to be more beneficial. They act as a barrier, which does not allow outside pollutants to penetrate the skin. Once you cleanse your face, it is important to apply a good facial oil that will moisten your skin and protect it from harmful air pollutants.TRY THIS- Wear a sun block to protect your skin against pollutants present in the air.- Cleanse your face using baby oil/ coconut oil on a cotton pad followed by a facewash using cold water. Replenish your skin using a toner to tighten pores and a nourishing moisturiser.- Supplement your diet with antioxidants rich in Vitamin C and E, which are excellent for skin texture.- Use a face mask at night to replenish lost nutrients. For example, a papaya mask is rich in vitamins and antioxidants. A turmeric mask helps clear the skin of acne marks wile a potato mask helps reduce dark circles. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Patna's air quality worse than Delhi and NCR,"PATNA: Air quality of Patna has deteriorated again as the Air Quality Index (AQI) increased from 317 on Wednesday to 338 on Thursday. Earlier, the AQI of Patna witnessed a major improvement on Wednesday as it had come dome down from 414 on Tuesday to 317.However, with the increase of 21 points, the AQI of Patna on Thursday was even higher than that of the entire Delhi-NCR region for the second consecutive day. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin on Thursday said the AQI level of New Delhi stood at 309, and that of Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram were recorded at 328, 325 and 284 respectively.The AQI is basically an assessment of the air quality taking into account eight pollutants: PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 10 micron), PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 micron), nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, ammonia and lead.The AQI of Patna has been in ""very poor"" category over a fortnight now. /The AQI had even surged above 400 to come under ""severe"" category. As per the CPCB norms, ""very poor"" air quality can lead to respiratory illness on prolonged exposure, while ""severe"" air quality can affect healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases.Deliberating on the fluctuating AQI in Patna, Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh told TOI: ""The AQI is likely to keep fluctuating for a few more days owing to variation in temperature. Wind velocity has also not been uniform, which is not leading to disbursement of dust particles. Thus, local factors are keeping the AQI at higher level."" Meanwhile, different departments and state government agencies have started taking steps to curb air pollution, especially dust particles and vehicular emission, in the state capital.While Patna Municipal Corporation is using big tankers for sprinkling water on the major thoroughfares, transport department has also launched intensive on-the-spot fitness check on vehicles to identify those running with higher level of emission and using petrol and diesel mixed with kerosene oil.According to a statement issued by transport department on Thursday, altogether 425 vehicles were checked at four different locations in the city, out of which 36 were seized and 61 fined for violating the emission norms.

How bad is the air? There's no clear answer,"CHENNAI: With just four pollution monitoring stations for the entire city, working with outdated machines and admitting to the fact that the readings are unsatisfactory due to snags, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) is not fulfilling its mandate.With haze enveloping the city every day, TNPCB has only a few units for real-time monitoring. But data is uploaded in an unfriendly format and is not easily accessible on the desktop or mobile. Senior officials in the rank of directors and deputy directors do not have data at hand.A senior TNPCB official said while one of the state board's monitor showed PM2.5 levels at 160 in Guindy, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed 260 in nearby Alandur on Thursday. /The PM2.5 reading throughout the day remained above 300 as per the CPCB monitoring station in Manali. But private live tracking sites such as Skymet and Windy.com showed levels between 85 and 100.TNPCB checks pollution levels at Kilpauk and Nungambakkam, but the data on its website is of November 4. Two days ago, when TNPCB wanted to check the air pollution levels in the city, their monitors consistently showed lower levels of pollution, whereas monitors installed by CPCB showed higher levels.A senior TNPCB official said four automated stations are monitoring air quality 24x7 at Kodungaiyur, Koyambedu, Perungudi and Royapuram. Another nine monitors have been installed across the city but they are being operated manually. Equipment for the four automated stations was bought four years ago. Data collected from these stations are sent for analysis and the results are published a day or two later, he said.Another TNPCB official said they use the same machines deployed by CPCB but the units develop snags.""The mismatch between data is confusing. Low-cost monitoring devices citizens groups are using are concurring with the CPCB data indicating that the pollution is very high. More than the data, people are experiencing discomfort and doctors are reporting an increase in the number of cases of respiratory problems,"" said Shweta Narayan of Healthy Energy Initiatives. ""All this indicates that the levels of pollution in the city are not within limits. If TNPCB is saying that everything is fine, then the board is either inept at monitoring pollution or does not have the will to discharge its duty. Citizens have a right to know what they are breathing.""S M Shiva Nagendra, professor of civil engineering department, IIT-M, said pollution, especially PM2.5 levels, will vary from one place to another depending on the dust generated. ""For example, T Nagar is a commercial area. A monitor near T Nagar bus terminus will show a level that will vary from readings near Panagal Park. Influence of location is an important factor,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Rise in cases of respiratory diseases in Muzaffarpur,"MUZAFFARPUR: The poor air quality in Muzaffarpur town has started taking its toll on the health of the residents.Muzaffarpur remained in second position in the list of most polluted cities of the state over the past few days. The Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 284 on Wednesday and was categorised in 'poor' category and it plunged to 341 on Thursday, which comes under 'very poor' category.As per the norms of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), 'very poor' air quality can lead to severe respiratory illness, while poor air quality also causes breathing discomfort to many on prolonged exposure. There has been an increase in the number of patients pouring in different government hospitals, including the sadar hospital and Sri Krishna medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) with respiratory problems.The gravity of the situation can be gauged from the fact that 226 patients with respiratory problems have been registered at SKMCH in the last 36 hours. /SKMCH superintendent Dr Sunil Kumar Shahi said, ""On an average, about 50 to 60 new patients with respiratory and lungs disorders are being registered at the hospital everyday since October 31.""""Most of the patients come with breathing problems. The number of people suffering with asthma-like symptoms has gone up five times and there has been an increase in the number of patients suffering from lungs tuberculosis. Similarly, many patients are also facing severe allergic conditions due to pollution which has gone up roughly ten times,"" Dr Shahi said.Dr CK Das of sadar hospital said that 100 out of 500 patients being registered at the outpatient department (OPD) of the hospital are being diagnosed with respiratory problems. ""About 35 to 40 have been admitted to the emergency unit,"" he said.Unplanned construction and other activities also lead to formation of heavy dust particles, said Dr Das.A Muzaffarpur- based ENT expert Dr Vijay Kumar attributed the air pollution to plying of old and unchecked vehicles in the town. ""The number of vehicles running in the town has gone up by nearly 15 times in the last one decade. These vehicles ply defying all emission norms leading to surge in pollution level,"" he said.District transport officer Nazir Ahmad asserted that the number of vehicles in Muzaffarpur town which are more than 15 years old is around 2.5 lakh. ""The state government has decided to ban commercial vehicles more than 15 years old with immediate effect and we are launching a drive soon to implement the same,"" he said.

Delhi Police vs lawyers: Who is to blame?,"A verbal spat initially triggered over a parking issue changed into vandalism when Delhi Police - protector of law - and lawyers - who preserve law - clashed with one another. The scuffle escalated in such a manner that it resulted in the firing of bullets and arson which covered the Tis Hazari sky with a thick plume of smoke at a time when the city was already sparring with severe air pollution.It has not only brought a bad name to the institutions of law and justice but also put on display the fragile relationship of the two pillars of democracy. As both institutions were found to be breaking the rules, it raises the serious question of whether they are above the law? And, does entitlement run deep in both the institutions?/According to former Uttar Pradesh top cop Prakash Singh both the parties prima facie crossed the limits of the law. ""Now who committed a greater transgression, who was more offensive, more aggressive and who took the law to a greater extent into his hands needs an inquiry. I won't be able to comment more on that. The police should restrain themselves but they are also expected to enforce the law of the land and irrespective of the person committing the offence, they should register a complaint,"" he said.Similar views were expressed by the constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap who said that both police and cops should have maintained the decorum of their professions and restrained themselves.""It is most unfortunate that those who are custodians of law and order violated it. I think it is setting a very poor example before the citizenry,"" Kashyap said.""Both, the lawyers and Delhi Police behaved as they should not have behaved. Now the matter is before the court and it will fix the responsibility and decide. Both the parties broke the law and they both need to learn to behave as responsible professionals. The ultimate sufferers are the people and the litigants,"" Kashyap added.However, Bar Council of India chief Manan Mishra accepted that some lawyers have crossed the line and assured that they will be dealt strictly but he also pointed out the undisciplined behaviour of the Delhi Police while handling the situation in Tis Hazari followed by their protest at police headquarters.""It was a minor issue of wrong parking but the Delhi Police shot a lawyer point blank and nobody is talking about that. It has not been highlighted by the media. But rather, the issue of a policeman being manhandled by a lawyer in Saket district court took the centre stage. The media is calling us criminals and hooligans which is unfair.""""I can't justify the action of the lawyers and we are taking action against them but look at the conduct of the police. Even after resorting to firing, lathicharge, they shamelessly sat on dharna. They are not obeying the command of their senior officers,"" Mishra said.This was not the first time that lawyers and police came to blows publicly.In the year 1988, Kiran Bedi, the then deputy commissioner of police (north zone) had a similar showdown with the legal fraternity when a lawyer arrested for theft was brought to the Delhi's Tis Hazari court in handcuffs. It resulted in a two-month-long halt to the court proceedings. The lawyers stopped the courts from functioning in Delhi and neighbouring states, demanding Bedi's resignation.In February 2017, a Station House Officer (SHO) was assaulted by a lawyer at the Karkardooma Court Complex in Shahdara. The lawyer had allegedly been arrested by the SHO earlier in connection with a case.In 2018, a lawyer practising in Karkardooma court was beaten up and his house was vandalised by the cops before arresting him. A bunch of lawyers then reached the police station and the issue was sorted.According to advocate Ashish Dixit, if cops have been at the receiving end then lawyers have also faced police heat but they have always backed each other in the times of severity.In 2015, the lawyers had come to the rescue of a policeman who was attacked by a few unidentified persons who had opened fire inside the premises of East Delhi's Karkardooma Court, Dixit recalled.""The relationship of lawyers and police is that of a cat and mouse. Clashes happen but they get sorted. The clash at Tis Hazari erupted because of police firing. On top of that, the lawyer accused of wrong parking was locked up. If he has done illegal parking then he should have been issued a challan. How can you lock him up and that too in court?"" Dixit questioned.Interestingly, in 2016, during the trial of JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar, lawyers had clashed with JNU students and journalists at Delhi's Patiala House court. At that point, the police were accused of remaining a mute spectator.""Police are generally disinclined to take on the lawyers because if you study the history of police-lawyer confrontation, wherever such confrontations have happened, irrespective of whether the police were right or wrong, it was the police which suffered. It has happened throughout from Kiran Bedi's time to this day it is happening,"" Singh added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Notice to 35 crushers, kolhus for burning cloth, plastic as fuel in Bijnor","Bijnor: Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) on Friday issued notices to 35 crushers and jaggery units for using cloth and plastic as fuel. The move comes in the wake of severe air quality in the region.There are as many as 70 crushers and over 800 kolhus in Bijnor. The pollution board authorities have also directed that wet scrubbers be used in all the units to help clean the industrial air.With air quality a matter of concern, the UPPCB has taken the initiative to curb air pollution. /It has been conducting raids in many districts, including Bijnor, to curb air pollution due to industrial activities.According to regional officer of pollution control board JP Maurya, ""We had received a tip-off that some kolhu owners were burning cloth and other banned material instead of required fuel for manufacturing jaggery. We raided several places over the past few days and found that 35 units were burning banned substances, causing pollution in the atmosphere. We have served notices to them with a warning that if they are found burning these substance in future, they will be slapped with a heavy fine.""Talking with TOI, Maurya said Bijnor district has recorded air pollution at 122 micrograms per cubic meter.""We have instructed all kolhu owners and crushers to install wet scrubbers on chimneys to curb polluted smoke. It sprinkles water on the smoke. Heavy pollutants fall down in the scrubber and clean smoke gets is emitted from the chimney,"" he added.Giving details, Maurya said, ""A small wet scrubber costs between Rs25,000 and Rs50,000. Koluh owners can afford it. We have set up the first scrubber here at a Kiratpur-based crusher which is being operated successfully.""West UP is known as the sugar bowl of the state. Thousands of kolhus crush cane to manufacture jaggery. Huge shafts of black smoke can be seen billowing of the chimneys of these units. Sometimes, kolhu owners burn cloth, tyres and plastic instead of proper fuel to process the cane juice. The waste of crushed cane is also burnt as fuel in the crushers and kolhus. A few unit owners sell it to paper mills at high prices. Once a wet scrubber is installed on their chimneys, air pollution can be reduced to a large extent, say experts.

"Enveloped by smog, city in the red","Chennai: Air samples from 15 locations across the city have higher levels of particulate matter than the prescribed Union ministry standards, a study by city-based NGO Coastal Resource Centre (CRC) with Healthy Energy Initiative (India) has shown.While T Nagar, Chennai's only smart city neighbourhood, was among the top five polluted neighbourhoods, north Chennai is worst affected by dust and heavy metal pollution. The PM2.5 level in the samples, collected from rooftops in Nochikuppam, Velachery, Thoraipakkam, T Nagar, Kasimedu and Minjur in industrialised north Chennai, ranged from 70.46 to 187.36 microgm/m3, which is 1.2 to 3.1 times higher than the government standard of 60 microgm/m3. ""The US agency would have issued an advisory of very unhealthy for four sites and unhealthy air quality for 11 others,"" read the report released on Saturday.Four of the five highest PM2.5 levels were recorded in north Chennai with Kuruvimedu, near NTPC Vallur's coal ash pond, registering the highest levels of 187 microgm/m3. The pollution in north Chennai is mainly due to the high concentration of industries such as an oil refinery and thermal power plants in Manali and Ennore. Collected in 24-hour periods between May and July, using Teflon filters fitted to a low volume air sampler, the samples were analysed for PM2.5 and metals in Chester labnet at Oregon, US, the report said.The samples also show the level of neurotoxin manganese is higher than what is prescribed by the US Environmental Protection Agency. /Similarly manganese and carcinogen nickel were also found to be higher than the WHO annual average. India does not have any standard for permissible limits of these metals in air.On the health effects of air quality, Dr Hissamudin Papa of HUMA Hospitals, said, ""Studies have shown a significant association between exposure to fine particles and premature mortality. Other effects include aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, lung disease, decreased lung function, asthma and heart attacks.""Though the city has three mega sea ports and an associated movement of heavy diesel vehicles, 3,300MW of coal thermal plants, a 10 million tonne per annum oil refinery, high vehicular traffic, and two massive smouldering garbage dumps, measures to reduce air pollution is lacking, say experts. For instance, Chennai is not among the 122 cities that have promised to reduce air pollution by 20% to 30% under the Centre's 2018 'National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)'. ""Despite Chennai's perennial pollution problem, the city has not been included in the NCAP which forces reduction of pollution,"" said Pooja Kumar of CRC. ""Chennai should be included in the NCAP so that a concrete plan is executed to clear up its air,"" said Dr G Chandrasekar, of the Doctors For Clean Air-Tamil Nadu.

Tea stalls & 'dhabas' told to switch to LPG,"PATNA: In an attempt to curb air pollution caused by burning of coal, the district administration and the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) have asked different gas companies to provide LPG connection to the owners of eateries and tea stalls on Bailey Road.According to Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, the smoke emitted through burning of coal is a major source of pollution. ""People living nearby suffer the most. /We are, therefore, focusing on the eateries on the main roads, but will soon try to provide LPG connection to others as well,"" he told this newspaper on Saturday.The divisional commissioner claimed that the step was being taken to make the owners of small restaurants aware of the effects of using coal. ""We are also trying to help small tea stall and 'dhaba' owners procure LPG connection at lower rates,"" he said.BSPCB chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh pointed out that LPG cylinders had already been supplied to some roadside eateries and gas pipelines installed at local restaurants.""Public responsibility is an integral part of this initiative. The state urban development and housing department has also come forward to help us,"" Ghosh said.Meanwhile, 'dhaba' and tea stall owners welcomed the initiative taken by the administration, but complained about the high cost. Praveen Sehgal, the owner of a restaurant on S P Verma Road, said, ""We began using gas stoves almost three months ago.

"In coal town Talcher, air is the biggest casualty","Angul: Industrialisation is taking a toll on the Angul-Talcher region. The abundance of coal has brought its own set of problems. As coal mines, power plants and other industries mushroom, it is the people who are facing the brunt of the crisis. /In fact, a Greeapeace study in 2018 revealed that the region is one of the largest Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) emission hotspots in the world. The main pollutants in the area are fly ash, dust, smoke, fume and hydro carbons. They cause serious health hazards for people, plants and animals. Coal mines and industries, including thermal power plants, emit a huge amount of carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and other gases, giving rise to pollution as well as temperature.Sources said in Talcher, suspended dust particulate matter (SPM) is well over 600 microns against a permissible limit that is below 400 microns.Due to dust and air pollution, diseases like tuberculosis, asthma, fluorosis, bronchitis, thyroid and stomach ailments have become endemic at Talcher and in other parts of the district.""Deposition of coal dusts in water bodies has become a regular feature in the area. Due to non-compliance of emission and discharge norms by the power plants and coal mines, toxic wastes and heavy metals, fluoride contents and other pollutants have contaminated the water, air and soil in the area,"" said Jayasri Tiwari, head of the zoology department at Talcher College.""Besides, thousands of heavy vehicles engaged in the transportation of coal contribute to the rise in carbon dioxide,"" she alleged.Pramod Chandra Biswal, a resident of Talcher Dera coal mine area, said, ""Atleast 25 people have died here in the past 10 years from tuberculosis, asthma, cancer and heart ailments."" There is a growing concern regarding the adverse effects of air pollution on human health. Cardio and respiratory diseases are very common seen these days, Biswal said.""All the water bodies including tanks, wells and other water sources in the region have become polluted. We had demanded massive plantation in the area in a bid to check pollution. But despite repeated reminders, little been done to check pollution here,"" he alleged.""Dust pollution can give rise to respiratory ailments. However, our people are on alert and providing health services to the affected,"" said Amarendra Natha Mohanty, chief district medical officer, Angul. Rakesh Kumar Mohanty, regional officer of state pollution control board at Angul, said, ""Air pollution due to power plants have gone down. But due to heavy vehicles plying on the road, the pollution level has increased in Talcher area. We have asked the concerned industrial units and mining authorities to check pollution.""He added, ""All industries and mining companies have been directed to prepare action plan to tackle pollution and comply with it. If anyone fails to comply, we will take stringent action.""Pollution related deaths apart, the heavy vehicles plying in Talcher town has turned the roads into a death trap.

"Rise in patients due to toxic air, officials told to compile data","Gurgaon: The dense smog that engulfed and choked NCR last week, pushed the region into a health emergency. Its repercussions were felt in the Millennium City too, with residents complaining of incessant coughing, breathlessness, skin allergies, eye infections among others.While the administration implemented measures under the graded response action plan (GRAP) to control deteriorating air quality, patients flooding the OPD of district's civil hospital is ceasing to see a downward trend. According to the doctors, there has been around 50% increase in the number of patients coming for treatment for pollution-related diseases and health conditions this year.Thus, in an attempt to help patients suffering due to the increasing pollution levels, the health department has directed officials to compile the data of number of patients coming to civil hospital for pollution-related diseases. /The data, officials claimed, will help in analysing the impact of air pollution on health and whether or not the steps taken under GRAP is helping or not. Acting on the directives, civil hospital has started sending daily reports to the health department which is being complied to understand the load of patients and diseases being reported. ""We've been sharing daily records with the government and administration. There has been an increase in cases of respiratory diseases, skin allergies, and eye infection. There was a spike in the number of patients after Diwali. The number is coming down now with the improvement in air quality,"" a health department official said.According to the staff at civil hospital, over 100 pollution-related cases were reported on Thursday and Friday. ""This has been the trend throughout the week. Once the compilation of the data is completed, we can have a better understanding of the overall situation,"" an employee working at the hospital said.

Farm fire impact may dip today,"New Delhi: Emissions released by the stubble fires in the fields in Punjab and Haryana and blown by winds to Delhi accounted for 25% of the PM2.5 pollutants in the city, one of the reasons why the capital saw spiked pollution levels on Tuesday. The field fire component is expected to go down slightly to 22% on Wednesday.The central forecast agency, SAFAR, said on Tuesday that the wind direction in the coming two days is likely to help transport stubble burning emission to Delhi, and its simulation showed biomass burning constituting 22% of the city's PM2.5 on November 13 ""even if the present declined fire trend is assumed"". This adverse condition could change from November 15.The effective stubble fire counts have been declining and stood at 740 on Monday. A day earlier on Sunday, the fire counts estimated by SAFAR-integrated multi-satellite methodology were much higher at 1,846. Satellite analyses by the Union ministry of environment and forests have shown the highest number of fires this year in Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Patiala in Punjab and Karnal, Kurukshetra and Kaithal in Haryana.Burning biomass emits large amounts of pollutants, such as carbon particles and carbon dioxide (CO2). Exposure to CO2 can lead to a number of health problems, including headache, nausea, dizziness and anxiety, reduced mental alertness, cardiovascular diseases, heart attack, impaired fetal development, even death in higher concentrations.On Saturday, Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar reviewed the steps being taken by Delhi and its neighbours to combat air pollution, and urged the state governments to start synergistic work instead of blaming each other.Last week, the Supreme Court lashed out at the authorities for failing to curb severe air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region. /It described the situation as a ""question of life and death"" of crores of people here, but it was ""very unfortunate"" that the authorities were not bothered about the crisis the people were facing. The bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra ordered Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to give small and marginal farmers support of Rs 100/quintal as incentive for not burn the remnants of the rice crop.The court also wondered why the state governments were unable to collect and purchase the harvest remains from farmers. Between October 15 and November 15 every year, the maximum number of fields in Punjab the other states see stubble-burning. The wind blows the pollutants released by the fires to Delhi, creating smog episodes and enveloping the capital in a haze. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Don't panic, says govt as city chokes","Chennai: On a day when minister for revenue and disaster management R B Udayakumar said there is nothing to panic about air quality in the city, particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5 causes respiratory distress) remained high in Velachery, Alandur and Manali on Monday.A PM 2.5 level above 100 is considered unhealthy for sensitive people and above unhealthy for all. Real-time reading during peak hours showed PM2.5 was about to 250 at Velachery and Alandur depot. At Manali village, PM2.5 varied between 100 and 150 through the day, showing that though the haze had dispersed and the sky was clear, the air was polluted. /Data for Manali industrial area was not available on the CPCB site. Experts said the level was high because of dust; levels of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide were within the limits. Asserting that intense efforts are being made to prevent air pollution in the city, the state government on Monday urged people not to panic, and requested them to not indulge in any activity that could pollute the air.Udayakumar held a review meeting with administrators of revenue, pollution control board and public health, as well as an IIT team, in the wake of reports of poor air quality. ""Pollution control board officials and experts said air would be polluted due to wind speed, land surface and sea temperature, humidity, vehicular traffic, dust on roads, construction activity, burning of solid waste and sea breeze. Due to variation in sea breeze, the pollution will be reduced gradually,"" said an official statement.The board has told Greater Chennai Corporation to take strict action against those who burn trees, tyres and waste, while road contractors and building owners have been advised to splash water to reduce pollution during road work and construction activities. Transport department has been told to intensify monitoring of vehicles to prevent pollution. ""The expected sea breeze, that was not occurring, was also a reason for air pollution in Chennai. The pollution control board and Meteorology department said the pollution will reduce steadily,"" the release said.A Meteorological department official said the haze has dissipated because of short showers and resumption of breeze. ""We can expect pollution level to go down when it starts raining because of the impact of an easterly trough later this week.""The health department has been told to provide treatment for respiratory problems in all hospitals. Those who have cough and wheezing symptoms should immediately seek treatment, the release said.Though the state has woken up, after almost a week when the haze and air pollution were frantically discussed by residents, experts and private weather bloggers say that the actual state of pollution is not known clearly in Chennai as real-time monitors are installed only at Alandur, Velachery, Manali village and Manali industrial area.IIT professor Shiva Nagendra said, ""There is a need to look at the quality of data from the monitoring stations and the location to identify pollution. There should be some baseline for air quality for every city based on the sources of pollution. The source may vary from one city to another and this should be managed to improve air quality.""

"Pollution check drive: Many autos, buses keep off roads","PATNA: Several autorickshaws and city buses with higher smoke emission level have gone off the roads to avoid hefty fines and seizure of their vehicles during the ongoing special drive of transport department to ban commercial vehicles more than 15 years old in order to curb air pollution.Traffic police officers attributed the move to voluntary removal of polluting vehicles to stringent action being taken by the state government, including cancellation of permit and fitness certificate.According to transport department figures, altogether 1,390 commercial vehicles have been checked at various places in the city during the last seven days. Out of them, 250 autorickshaws and buses were seized while 608 drivers paid fines for not following air pollution norms.Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal told this newspaper on Monday: ""Fitness of vehicles is being checked by mobile pollution checking vans under the supervision of motor vehicle inspector, district transport officer and enforcement sub-inspectors.""He further said: ""Altogether 214 vehicles were checked on Monday and 18 of them were seized and 65 paid fines for violating pollution norms, including not possessing pollution under control certificates (PUCs).""Some autorickshaws and buses have changed their routes because of the drive. The autorickshaws plying between Patna GPO and Phulwarisharif are taking Mithapur route to avoid being checked near Saptmurti.Patna Autorickshaw Association's secretary Ranjit Kumar alleged that autorickshaw drivers were being penalised even for carrying online PUC. /""The PUC is being issued by the transport department online, then why they are imposing hefty fines on autorickshaw drivers. This is the main reason that several autorickshaws have gone off the road and some have changed their routes,"" he said.""The association representatives will also meet the transport department officials and share their grievances. If they do not hear our pleas, we will stage a protest,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"From apples to peanuts, these are the most effective ingredients to battle air pollution by nutritionist Kavita Devgan","It is that time of the year again when merely breathing the highly polluted air can cause respiratory conditions including coughing, sore throat and even breathlessness. Sadly, our lungs bear the maximum brunt of the pollutants as the quality of air hits a new low with every passing day. Time to stop complaining and take matters in your handWhen your respiratory health starts taking the beating because of the particulates present in the air, it is strongly advisable to take care of your health. /Instead of waiting for the government and authorities to come around and do their job, we need to stop whining and do the best we can to battle air pollution. The foolproof plan to battle air pollution We spoke to nutritionist Kavita Devgan who gave us a plan to tackle the dreaded air pollution head-on. She also listed down certain lifestyle changes and food items which can keep your body fit and fight the side-effects of particulates present in the air. According to her, you should absolutely include food items like apples, oranges, bananas, pineapple, mint and oregano in your diet to strengthen your immunity, unclog your arteries and airway and breathe better. She also suggests exercising, staying away from smoke and shunning junk food completely. Talking about the junk and processed food items and why you need to avoid them, she said, ""Junk the junk. There is already an onslaught happening on your immunity. Please do not eat any more junk. Instead, I suggest trying to have 2-3 fruits every day. There are enough studies to show that for our respiratory health, 3 fruits a day can really give you rich dividends.""Emphasising on the importance of vitamin C intake, Kavita further said, ""Try and have a lot of Vitamin C. You have to actively prevent inflammation happening in your lungs and Vitamin C is almost like a godsend for you. Try and have amla, oranges, they are in season. Focus on Vitamin C rich fruits and vegetables every day.""She also suggested some helpful lifestyle tweaks to ensure that your health does not bear the brunt of growing air pollution. Since allergic symptoms like sneezing, mucus formation and cold and cough are really common, one should eat food items which are natural antihistamines. Moreover, make sure your morning cup of tea has a lot of ginger in it. Have one cup early in the morning and second after you come back home in the evening. Ginger has compounds that make sure the pollutants get expelled from the body.Lastly, every time you step out, take a clove and put it under your tongue. It is going to make sure that phlegm does not accumulate in your throat and oesophagus.For detailed information on how to battle the dreaded air pollution, here is video:  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Gurgaon's office hub is a pollution hotspot too,"Gurgaon: The Udyog Vihar industrial area has once again been listed as a pollution hotspot by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).According to the inspection reports that were carried out in the last 15 days, open dumping of garbage and unpaved roads were the major causes of air pollution. Sources in CPCB said this is the second time that the industrial area has been listed as one of the pollution hotspots in NCR. ""Bad roads and open dumping of waste have made it one of the pollution hotpots in NCR. /This is the only area listed as a pollution hotspot from Gurgaon in the list,"" said an official.TOI visited all five phases of Udyog Vihar to find out the reasons behind this. Mixed garbage was found dumped at five locations - along the National Highway in Phase II and III, behind HSIIDC complex, in vacant plots along Jwala Mill road, in vacant plots in Phase IV near the passport office, and near the traffic police post (Sector 19) near Phase III. On the other hand, most of the roads in the area were found to be in a bad condition. While Shankar Road, one of the arterial roads, had unpaved footpaths, Udyog Vihar Phase II road and Jwala Mill Marg were also not well-maintained.""The problem is it is an industrial and commercial area. Many people come here to work, but there are hardly any residents. That is the reason nobody connects with the area and the authorities ignore it. But dusty roads, waste dumping and unregulated construction activities have led to an increase in air pollution,"" said Rajat Sharma, a marketing professional who works in Udyog Vihar.Bushra Ismail, an entrepreneur working at GoWork in Phase 1, said the 'omnipresent' haze ensures he and his colleagues stay indoors: ""Everyone used to hang out on the terrace but now we are confined to our cabinets. The foyer used to be a popular chilling spot, but now we cough and our eyes burn if we stand there for too long."" Gauri Khanna, an account executive at FleishmanHillard, pointed out the 'poor' public transport infrastructure in Gurgaon. ""People in our office have been carpooling diligently, but it is difficult for a Delhi resident to reach Udyog Vihar. One has to change multiple modes of transport. We are contributing to pollution, but there are no sustainable options available,"" she said. ""Traffic congestion leads to more pollution. While the main roads are undergoing widening, the internal roads are so bad and unpaved that dust is omnipresent. It is so unfortunate that the hub of multinational companies is in such a bad condition,"" said Praveen Yadav, president of Gurgaon Udyog Association. Activists said that despite EPCA's directions, nothing has changed in the area. ""Udyog Vihar is one of the most polluted areas in the city since it is an industrial hub. The green cover is quite low in the area. Hardly any action has been taken by the authorities,"" said Aseem Takyar, an RTI activist. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Student's crusade against burning plastic bears fruit,"GUWAHATI: A crusade against plastic by a Class IX student from Chabua near Dibrugarh town has compelled the Chabua Municipal Board (CMB) and the administration to levy penalty for burning plastic and other harmful products. Asthanandini Borgohain, a student of Vivekananda Kendra Vidyalaya, Laipuli, started her protest by standing alone amid smoke and holding placards towards October-end. This unique stir got a overwhelming response on the social media and raised eyebrows of the district administration which had been a mute spectator to burning of plastic. /""Everyone talks about prohibiting single-use plastic bags. But what about dumping plastic products and burning them, which is far more dangerous. In those areas where there is no plant to process such products, it's causing nuisance. No action is taken for burning plastic in the open,"" said Borgohain. She added that it is going to be a massive challenge to turn her crusade into a movement.Chabua circle officer Manash Jyoti Nath, who is also the executive officer of the CMB, said lack of legal provisions to penalize people burning plastic had been the biggest hurdle to curb air pollution. She added that Borgohain's protest was an eye-opener for the administration and the municipality as school-goers had to bypass plastic dumping sites emitting harmful smoke every morning.""There is no legal provision to punish anybody for burning plastic. However, we can register a case for creating public nuisance if someone disposes and burns plastic, causing harm to public health. Borgohain's protest drew our attention. The locals of the area were touched by her campaign. At present, we are carrying out awareness campaigns against plastic burning by distributing leaflets in commercial establishments. Ten days from now, we will start penalizing the violators,"" Nath told TOI on Tuesday. The CMB has cautioned traders, vendors and citizens of the Chabua municipal area that distributing, selling, disposing and use of any polythene carrybags (below 50 micron) and thermocol shall be punishable and a fine amounting to Rs 10,000 for wholesalers, Rs 5,000 for retailers and Rs 1,000 for users (street vendors) will be imposed.Though Borgohain's protest has led to reduction in burning plastic significantly in Chabua, officials in the administration said finding a way to scientifically dispose plastic products remains a cause of concern. ""Even those plastic bags which are within permissible limits are burnt along with thermocol. Prohibiting the use of single-use plastic bags is fine, but transforming the habit of the citizens, who feel that burning plastic is not harmful, is difficult,"" said Nath.While the ban on single-use plastic seems to be quite effective in state capital Guwahati, disposal of plastic products remains a grave concern in rest of the towns and suburban areas of Assam due to lack of solid waste management plants.

Activists differ from MPCB's stand on good air quality,"Aurangabad: The historic city of Aurangabad has been listed among the 102 most-polluted cities in the country but the state pollution control board maintains that the air quality is good. The clean air campaigners, however, say that the presence of high amount of particulate matter and smoke is a concern for Aurangabad. Over the last one week, the city has not witnessed any precipitation due to which there is a considerable increase in dust. /When asked about the air quality, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board's regional officer Anil Mohekar said their hourly monitoring of the air quality in the city shows that the air quality parameters are very well within the limits.However, environment activist Kishor Pathak, says that the MPCB's air quality monitoring mechanism is archaic and inefficient. ""The air monitoring systems at Command Area Development Authority office, SB College and district collector office are old and the measuring instrument has rusted. There is a difference in the data collected from these stations. It cannot be relied upon,"" he said. Pathak, who is also a homeopathy doctor, said there had been a rise in the number of cases of respiratory and upper respiratory tract infections and the use of antibiotics and anti-allergic medication. ""Air pollution plays a major role in the reduction of immunity. This is confirmed through the kind of complaints we are getting,"" Pathak said.A research carried out by Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC) states that while the global standards of PM 2.5 is 10 micrograms per cubic metre, at Aurangabad it is recorded to be 39.9 micrograms per cubic metre. This, the research claimed, causes the life expectancy in the city to drop by 2.9 years.Notably, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) had submitted its air quality action plan to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) last year. The plan has been approved and a fund of Rs 12 lakh has been disbursed to the AMC to implement it under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). In the first leg, the funds are to be used to make citizens aware of the air quality. For this, awareness workshops will be held at institutional level and display boards about air quality parameters will be put up at different locations in the city. The process of holding workshops has begun while the Master Systems Integrator (MSI) project of the Smart City will ensure putting up of display boards.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Kids hit worst by climate change: Lancet,"NEW DELHI: Climate change is having a drastic impact on children who are worst affected and suffering the most from the rise in infectious diseases, malnutrition and rising food prices, a new report in the Lancet Countdown says urging countries to pursue the Paris Agreement pathway and limit warming to secure a healthier future for coming generations.While the rapid change in climate is primarily driven by the combustion of fossil fuels, India and China sustained the largest increases in daily population exposure to wildfires from 2001-14 to 2015-18, with an increase of over 21 million exposures in India and 17 million exposures in China over this time period, the report on 'Health and Climate Change' said.Globally, 77% of countries experienced an increase in daily population exposure to wildfires.While children are the worst affected by climate change, the impact on human health continues through adolescence to adulthood and old age.Through adolescence and beyond, air pollution damages the heart, lungs, and every other vital organ. These effects accumulate over time, and into adulthood, with global deaths attributable to ambient fine particulate matter (PM25) remaining at 2.9 million in 2016 and total global air pollution deaths reaching 7 million.In India, dangerous levels of outdoor fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) contributed over 529,500 premature deaths in 2016.""With its huge population and high rates of healthcare inequality, poverty, and malnutrition, few countries are likely to suffer from the health effects of climate change as much as India. /Diarrhoeal infections, a major cause of child mortality, will spread into new areas, whilst deadly heatwaves, similar to one in 2015 that killed thousands of people in India, could soon become the norm,"" says co-author of the report Poornima Prabhakaran from the Public Health Foundation of India.The 2019 report said a child born today will experience a world that is more than four degrees warmer than the pre-industrial average. Downward trends in global yield potential for all major crops tracked since 1960 threaten food production and food security, with infants often the worst affected by the potentially permanent effects of undernutrition. Children are among the most susceptible to diarrhoeal disease and experience the most severe effects of dengue fever as well.The Lancet Countdown is an international, multidisciplinary collaboration, dedicated to monitoring the evolving health profile of climate change and providing an independent assessment of the delivery of commitments made by governments worldwide under the Paris Agreement.The 2019 report presents an annual update of 41 indicators across five key domains: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability; adaptation, planning, and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. The report represents the findings and consensus of 35 leading academic institutions and UN agencies from every continent. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Haze eclipses programme on missing kids,"New Delhi: 'I am sorry, we have deprived you of the happiness of celebrating you and your day,"" said Nobel Peace laureate Kailash Satyarthi on Children's Day, after an event that was planned at India Gate had to be cancelled due to rising air pollution. Stating that there should be clean air for children to breathe, he urged Prime Minster Narendra Modi to amend the Air Act 1981 and to come up with a five-year national action plan to ensure clear air.At the event, over 5,000 children were to form a human chain intended to draw the attention of the authorities to India's missing children. The event was deferred to a later date owning to the severity of the national capital's air pollution.A group of children volunteers later urged Delhi Police and other authorities to strictly implement a 2013 Supreme Court order on missing children, besides focusing attention on the investigations. /They handed over the memorandum to Special Commissioner (Child and Women) Nuzhat Hasan and Joint Commissioner David Lal.Jointly planned by Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA), Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation (KSCF) and the Delhi Legal Services Authority (DLSA), the human chain was intended to draw the attention of the authorities to missing children. The latest National Crime Records Bureau report revealed that 1,19,013 children went missing by the end of 2017.""I was happy and proud to learn that today on Children's Day, thousands of you would stand up at India Gate for those of you, who are missing, kidnapped, trafficked and exploited... I am straining to hear the sounds of your slogans, which have fallen silent grasping for breathe. We have choked your voices in this gloomy polluted air.

"Patna air quality 'very poor', worst in Bihar","PATNA: Air quality of Patna slipped into the 'very poor' category on Wednesday as dust particles and haze enveloped the city.According to the Central Pollution Control Board, the air quality index (AQI) of Patna was 373 at 4pm while Muzaffarpur recorded 326, both of which fall under the 'very poor' category. At 243, Gaya logged the third highest AQI level in the state, which falls in the 'poor' category.The AQI is rated as 'good' between 0-50, 'satisfactory' for 51-100, 'moderate' for 101-200, 'poor' for 201-300, 'very poor' for 301-400 and 'severe' for 410-500. Very poor AQI level can cause and aggravate respiratory illnesses on prolonged exposure.The Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) chairman, Ashok Ghosh, said change in weather pattern like decrease in temperature and no movement in air in the past two days has increased the AQI level of Patna. ""As per the prediction of the weather department, the situation is going to remain the same for the next few days as there will be no or minor changes in the weather conditions,"" Ghosh said.""For the past three years, we faced the same situation. /The air quality will gradually improve after January. We can also see improvement in air quality, only if there is winter rain or high wind velocity which will wash away or disperse the pollutants in the air,"" he said.PM 2.5, the tiniest and worst among the pollutants, was the primary culprit at 373 microgram per cubic metre (ug/m3), followed by harmful emissions such as nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone recorded on Wednesday.Pradhan Parth Sarthi, professor at the department of environmental science of Central University of South Bihar and president of the Patna chapter of Indian Meteorological Society told this newspaper that the north-westerly wind is likely to increase the air velocity in December. ""For a couple of days, the weather will likely remain dry. So there will be no chances of dispersion of pollutants in the air,"" he said.The rise in pollution is forcing people to use pollution masks. Ranjan Kumar, a chemist at a wholesale shop in Govind Mitra Road said air-filter masks from all stores have run out of stock. ""We have placed order for the masks, especially N95, which is more in demand.

Track the pollution level in your city,"As air quality falls, lung cases rise in hosps","Kolkata: Galloping pollution levels have started taking a heavy toll on the city's health with several private hospitals reporting a sharp spurt in the number of patients suffering from lung ailments that can be linked directly to poor air quality. At least three private hospitals have registered a 20% jump in the number of patients seeking treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), bronchitis, dry cough and asthma - diseases which are mostly commonly caused or aggravated by air pollution - since Diwali, which was followed by a rise in particulate matter emission. If the last three years' trend persists, pollution-induced lung ailments could double between now and January, fear doctors and experts.The city's AQI (air quality index) has consistently been in the 'poor' or 'very poor' categories post-Diwali, except for the few days when wind and rain brought by cylone Bulbul cleansed the air. Since 2016, Kolkata hospitals have seen a 100% rise in the number of admissions for asthma and COPD  in the post-Diwali period (Oct-Jan), according to Fortis Hospital pulmonologist and critical care expert Raja Dhar. /""Once AQI turns poor, there is an immediate spurt in the number of patients seeking consultation and admission for lung diseases. Existing COPD and asthma patients are  most vulnerable and form the bulk of those seeking treatment. With the city's PM 2.5 count shooting up, the number of these patients will continue to rise till the end of winter,"" said Dhar.This year, the number of patients has been exceptionally high, said pulmonologist Raja Dhar. ""While last year the number of OPD patients spiralled more sharply, this time many have had to be admitted. The majority have recurring exacerbations in their lungs. Many don't have any lung infection but are suffering from dry cough or breathing trouble, which is obviously pollution-induced,"" said Dhar.Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals pulmonologist Sushmita Roy Chowdhury pointed out that there has been a rise in the number of new patients with no existing airways disease. ""They have been suffering from a dry cough, tightness in the chest and a mild shortness of breath, which indicate a pollution trigger. They have no lung infection or fever, which points at pollution. Even those with a history of COPD or asthma have been suffering from a dry, persistent cough, especially the elderly who have been exposed to the outdoors over the last fortnight,"" she said. CMRI Hospital has seen a jump in the number of lung patients since Diwali. ""The AQI jump is immediately followed by a spurt in the number of lung patients. So far, we have got both new and existing patients with the latter being more critical. Smokers are more vulnerable than the rest. We now find that smokers suffer more frequently from upper and lower respiratory tract infections than ever before. This is especially true in winter when the pollution load rises sharply. It can be linked to the city's rising pollution,"" said CMRI consultant pulmonologist Ranjan Das. Dhar cited the instance of two sexagenarians who needed hospitalization for recurring breathing distress in the last week. ""Neither had any infection but the moment they breathed in the outdoor air, their airways choked up,"" he said. More severe bouts of asthma were an important indicator of the rising intensity of pollution-induced ailments, felt consultant Arindam Biswas.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

In his introductory speech, he said, ""Air pollution is responsible for 12.5% of deaths in the country. Under the global umbrella, 92% of people do not breathe safe air.""Pointing out that the government has come up with schemes for developing Smart Cities, Sarnaik said, ""The policies highlight that individual cities need to be developed along with assimilating pollution-control methods.""He said that diseases including infectious, contagious, food-borne, communicable, non-communicable, air-borne, organic, water-borne and mental disorders have a clear cause that is breathing foul air.Speaking about research in India, former director of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) and government of India adviser Satish Wate said, ""Neeri has an elaborate plan to tackle air pollution, which has been funded by the government. /The fact remains that air pollution is prevalent. A cost-effective solution needs to be established.""""The source, chain that is being followed, receptor, whether the impact be quantified and preventive measures; all this need to be identified before approaching the problem."" He also emphasized on the importance of pinpointing specific parameters that need to be studied and addressed after proper research and development.Giving an overview of the issue, health ministry adviser Dr Sunil Khaparde said ""Air quality has become a major problem in Northern India. When we monitor the Air Quality Index (AQI), the figures are seen to be alerts and warnings. The central government has given commitment to the Supreme Court that measures will be taken to provide relief from pollution.""""India's strategy to eliminate tuberculosis by the year 2025 is ambitious, yet attainable if a multi-pronged plan is adopted,"" he said.Dr Khaparde said, ""Along with patients, we need to ensure the safety of workers in the health care facility setting. Segregation of patients and fast-tracking those with serious problems to OPDs is an important step. Cross ventilation with the help of open doors and windows and patient beds distance should be aligned with the guidelines. Personal protection measures like using masks and educating patients about cough hygiene should be prioritized.""Environment consultant from USA Bill Palmer spoke about germicidal ultraviolet light as an airborne infection prevention and control solution.

Other districts like Hapur, Meerut and Bulandshahr showed above 300 levels that fall under 'very poor' category. Schools remained closed for the second day on Friday, following a shutdown order after AQI fell to 'severe' category on Wednesday. /West UP and Delhi-NCR regions turned into gas chambers soon after Diwali. There is no respite since then.According to weather experts, a fall in the temperature and wind speed led to the accumulation of pollutants in the air . The situation was worsened by a cloud cover that blocked sunlight. The problem was compounded by stubble burning by farmers in neighbouring Punjab and Haryana. While West UP alone has witnessed more than 45 FIRs over the past fortnight against farmers for stubble burning, the problem is yet to be resolved.At the same time, Met office has predicted some respite in store in the coming days,Meanwhile doctors have advised that schoolchildren and elderly must use masks at least when they are out in the open. According to Dr Harish Mohan Rastogi, a physician based in Meerut, ""Above 400 AQI levels begin to affect healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases. Using masks and minimal outside exposure is the only remedy till the time pollution does not get dispersed. Now that schools will again open and smog being at higher levels in the mornings, it is advisable that children, the elderly and those who already suffer from respiratory diseases to use masks and keep their eyes covered using goggles in the day time.""

Strict instructions have been given to sanitation inspectors to refrain from any such practice that contributes to adding to pollution levels.""An AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor', 401-500 'severe' and above 500 is 'severe-plus emergency'. The AQI takes into account five chief pollutants - particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 micrometres (PM10), PM2.5, ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution: Agra doctor urges health ministry to issue advisory for pregnant women,"AGRA: A senior paediatric surgeon from Agra has urged the Union ministry of health (MoH) to issue a health advisory for pregnant women in order to prevent them from having premature deliveries, foetal deaths, and abnormalities caused by rising air pollution.Dr Sanjay Kulshrestha, who had earlier filed a public interest plea in the Supreme Court in this regard, said air pollution is a 'disease' in an epidemic form and requires an aggressive national program like that for polio, tuberculosis, AIDS, etc. He said, despite SC intervention on his PIL, the Union health ministry had not issued any advisory for pregnant women, who are more vulnerable to air pollution.He told TOI that out of total foetal period, the first 6-8 weeks are most crucial, because of organogenesis (organ formation). He said if a woman is exposed to higher levels of PM 2.5 one month prior to or after conception, the foetus is more likely to develop some birth defects.Citing national and international research reports, he said, about 1.7 million babies are delivered every year in India with birth defects, and of these, 1.7 lakh are linked to air pollution. Dr Kulshrestha said, ""We have to accept the fact that air pollution is an alarming threat to the fragile foetus. Therefore, we need to take some urgent short and long term measures in India to fight this biggest manmade disaster.""Suggesting long-term actions, he said that the government should initiate multi-centric research to establish a relationship of air pollution with adverse outcome of pregnancy. /On that basis, authorities should take appropriate actions to prevent or minimise such pollution-related diseases in foetuses.The doctor said that the status of pollution, contents, and contributing sources varies from country to country or even among different cities of the same country. Therefore 'we' need to study it in details and to make 'customised action plans' to control the air pollution.On short term actions, he said the health authorities should release advisories for pregnant women regarding ""what to do and what not to do"" to safeguard themselves from air pollution. He advised that pregnant women should avoid busy roads with high traffic loads, particularly during peak hours as vehicular exhaust pollution is one of the major sources of air pollution. They should use mask and use air purifiers.Though, there has been a significant improvement in the average Air Quality Index (AQI) in major cities, the overall situation continues to be poor. While Agra's AQI was recorded at 73 (satisfactory) on Sunday, other cities monitored by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) show PM 2.5 value in poor and very poor category. While Delhi, Ghaziabad, and Greater Noida recorded average PM 2.5 value in poor category, Kanpur recorded PM 2.5 307 (very poor). For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Even pets are having a ruff time coping with the #airpocalypse,"As anti-air pollution masks come back in force, schools are ordered to remain shut for a second time this season and people have a difficult time coping with the airpocalypse, the furry babies in NCR are also facing numerous health issues. Although most pets face a difficult time around Diwali every year due to air and noise pollution, the situation is worse this year as the air quality in NCR has remained in ""severe"" or ""hazardous"" category for days together.Though pet parents say they are doing everything to keep their furry babies healthy and safe, several pets have taken a hard hit this winter, with many having to resort to nebulisers. As per veterinarians in the city, air pollution affects pets in the same way as it affects humans.'My pet doesn't leave the room that has an air purifier' Noida resident Anubha Majethia's 11-year-old Labrador, Ace, developed bronchitis during the first week of November. ""Ace was constantly coughing and his appetite was going down, too."" /""We consulted a veterinarian who diagnosed a bad case of bronchitis attack. He recovered after taking medicines for over a week. He now prefers to stay in the room that has an air purifier,"" says Anubha, who lives in Sector 107.Mundka resident Achal Gupta also noticed that his one-year-old Indie, Ozzo, was facing trouble breathing the day after Diwali. ""I noticed that Ozzo was breathing very heavily; his belly was getting sucked into his ribcage. The vet gave him a nebuliser and prescribed some medicines. I can't even take him outside now, so he has to relieve himself in our toilet,"" says Achal. To keep his four pets healthy and help them cope with the poor air, Achal has made changes to their diet now. ""Apart from placing air purifiers across the house, I am using some home remedies to help my pets breathe better. I have started adding turmeric and apple cider vinegar to their food to help flush out toxins from their system,"" says Achal. 'A 25% increase in number of pets with breathing issues' As per doctors, older dogs and young puppies are at a higher risk of developing breathing issues because of pollution. According to some vets in the city, there has been a 25% increase in the number of pets coming in with respiratory problems this year. ""Since October 25 this year, the number of pets suffering from pharyngitis (sore throat), breathing problems and upper respiratory tract issues has increased. We have been treating these cases through nebulisation. We handle over 10 such cases per day, which is a significant increase from last year,"" says Dr Gautam Anand, who has veterinary clinics in Vikaspuri and Greater Kailash-1. According to Dr Pramod from Pet Chikitsa Veterinary Hospital in Gurgaon, this year has seen a 25% increase in such cases. ""The number of cases of pets suffering from respiratory diseases usually increases during this time of the year. However, there is a 25% increase in such cases this year, due to the severe air pollution,"" he explains, adding that prolonged exposure to bad air may lead to chronic bronchitis. Air pollution also causing other diseases in pets""Cases of conjunctivitis and ear infections in pets have also increased because of the bad air quality. After falling ill, some pets suffer from depression as well and it takes them a long time to recover,"" says Dr Vineet Kumar, a veterinary doctor who has his clinic in Sector 12, Noida. He adds that he is currently handling at least 15 cases of air pollution-triggered diseases in pets every day, as opposed to 10 cases a day during the same time last year.Keep your pooch indoors and well hydrated Take the pet out early in the morning but only if it is absolutely necessary or if the dog is not potty trained Try to reduce the exercise time of the pet. Exercise should be done in gardens or parks, away from busy roads Since older dogs and young puppies are at a higher risk, immunity-boosting supplements should be provided to them The pets should be hydrated to flush out toxins Pet parents should keep the house clean and free from dust; keep windows and doors closed at all times  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Readers' Response,"The government should encourage citizens of the city and state to segregate their waste at home and give things that can be recycled- paper, metal, plastic, clothes- to the vendors who can collect it and further make a living through selling and recycling. The rest of the waste such as organic waste from waste food, should only be collected in bins so that they can be used to make biogas and used appropriately in small towns and dwellings. The dumpyard should be used to collect organic waste only and should be well equipped for biogas generation and storage. /The dumpyard should have air filters so that the air around is less polluted and residents of the area are less inconvenienced. It would be a blessing not only people who reside near Jawaharnagar but also for people who work there. Deepesh SuranaDisposal of garbage has become a Herculean task for the govt as there is large quantities of garbage being generated. With the vertical growth of buildings, there is very little scope for the disposal of garbage. Manpower has become a serious issue for the government with regard to collection of garbage. The government has to set up mechanical devices throughout the twin cities for the collection of garbage as well as disposal.Private contractors and government agencies should work together to collect and dispose of the garbage using scientific methods. Physical collection and disposal of garbage may be difficult in the near future. Govt should take serious steps to solve this problem. Dumping yards pose health problems because of decaying of garbage caused due to late disposal. If garbage disposal is not taken up on war footing it will pose a problem in the near future. Though segregation is being done, at disposal end waste is mixed up thereby defeating the purpose. This should be avoided and separate disposal of dry and wet waste should be given top priority.Dr GV KumarSegregated trash from every household collected by trash collectors and garbage from dumpsters placed in every area including garbage thrown at road corners across Secunderabad are gathered by GHMC trash vans. But the garbage is then combined together and dumped in the Jawaharnagar dumpyard leading to unbearable stench in the adjoining areas. Residents living in and around Dammaiguda, Ambedkar Nagar, Saket and Kapra are forced to shut the windows all through the day. Despite several complaints made to civic authorities articulating their views about poor and deteriorating condition in Jawaharnagar dumpyard and a possibility of spread of diseases, the lackadaisical attitude of officials continue. As hygiene has gone for a toss, it is important that the government steps in and make arrangements to ensure that adequate spraying and sprinkling of disinfectants is done on a continuous basis to arrest bad odour. Secondly, burning of trash should be stopped to prevent smoke, containing large amounts of particulate matter, causing respiratory and other related problems besides leading to air pollution.Srinivasan Ramaswamy  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"At IIT, US scientist praises Swachh Indore's fresh air","Indore: Increasing air pollution at Delhi is severely affecting Indian tourism industry as no one would like to expose to such harmful air and government should come out with measures to control it, Planetary Science Institute (Arizona, USA) senior scientist Dr Jeffrey S Kargel said. Kargel, a geologist, glaciologist and planetary scientist, hailed Indore for its fresh air and cleanliness. ""Indore has such fresh air. /I was under impression that Indore must be as bad as Delhi. (International) tourists just see news about Delhi where visibility is almost zero and this is affecting the tourism in India,"" said Kargel. He was in Indore to attend the 7th convocation ceremony at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Indore as the chief guest. Kargel said that solutions to air pollution is possible by bringing change in habit and convincing farmers not to burn stubble, provide financial assistance to change habits and take alternatives. ""It may be expensive for farmers to change habits but it is extremely expensive for India to be inhaling smoke that leads to health issues and also hitting tourism sector."" The planetary scientist remarked the soft launch of Chandrayaan -2 as a technology marvel and India's rise to space power. ""It was probably a slight timing issue when to start the descent. There is a loss, no question about it but I see the mission as an amazing success. India has risen as a space power and next step will be equivalent to Europe,"" said Kargel. He also praised India for live telecast of the mission and carrying it out in relatively small budget. Kargel expressed concerns about melting glaciers and it's leading to loss of snow and ice changing the water equation, but it does not mean that water will disappear. IIT-I director Professor Pradeep Mathur emphasized that the institute has attained exceptional level of excellence by being different and urged students to continue to be different.

"Epilepsy is treatable, don't hide it, say city doctors","Nagpur: Even as 24 lakh new cases of epilepsy surface every year, doctors from the city say it can be cured if the treatment is started early and people need not hide the condition. On the occasion of National Epilepsy Day on November 17, the doctors also appealed to the government to run special clinics for epileptic patients and ensure they get timely medicines as the incidence of the brain disorder is more in poor people.""Nearly 80% of the people with epilepsy live in low and middle income countries. If treatment is stated early, majority of the patients with epilepsy can be cured. /Proper diagnosis is crucial, as there are other conditions which look like epilepsy but actually are not epilepsy,"" said Dr Chandrashekhar Meshram, president of Tropical Neurology Group of World Federation of Neurology.In India there are about 12 million persons with epilepsy. Dr Meshram added that 70% of the patients of epilepsy can be completely cured and others can be helped to lead a better life. Epilepsy is neurological disease characterized by recurrent seizures which are due to brief disturbances in the electrical functions of the brain with excessive electrical discharges in a group of brain cells. Main reason for recurrent epileptic attacks is not taking the medicines regularly as per doctor's advice. Special attention should be given during festivals and functions, doctors prescribe. ""Diwali by and large is not very happy for epileptic patients and some patients get breakthrough seizures. The possible reasons could be air pollution, sound pollution, change in diet, excitement, lack of sleep and missing of medicines,"" Dr Meshram said.Epilepsy can occur at any age. One in 200 persons has a chance of getting epilepsy during their lifetime.""Creative and talented people like Julius Caesar, Isaac Newton, Napoleon Bonaparte, Charles Dickens, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Vincent Von Gogh, Lewis Carroll, Alfred Nobel, Agatha Christie, Richard Burton, Jonty Rodes and Tony Graig too suffered seizures,"" says Dr Shyam Babhulkar, president of Nagpur Neuro Society.""Epilepsy is considered a major social stigma in many parts of our country and there are various misconceptions about it,"" said Dr Nitin Chandak, Consultant Neurologist. Dr Neeraj Baheti, neurologist at CIIMS Hospital, said that the most common cause for poor seizure control is irregular dose of medicines. ""About 20% of patients don't take medicines,"" he said. Dr Sanjay Ramteke said that poor people generally end up dying accidents after seizures due to lack of medicines. ""Government must provide sufficient anti-epileptic drug. The government gives medicines for seven days and it is difficult for patients to come again. Also the government should start special clinics for epilepsy patients,"" he said.

The proposal was mooted in Federation Of Sector Welfare Associations (Foswac) meeting held on Sunday where the members expressed their concern over the worsening air quality in the city and authorities' apathy towards the situation. /During the meeting, the members of various resident welfare associations (RWAs) said that the number of vehicles in the city is the highest in the country compared to the population and residents commuting in private vehicles add to the problem. Foswac secretary R S Gill asked why autorickshaws and private taxis are not being made CNG-friendly. He criticised the concerned authorities for not deliberating over possible solutions for the problem of rising air pollution. Foswac spokesperson Pankaj Gupta suggested that the association should give representation to regional transport office and Chandigarh traffic police for setting up special checkpoints in the city to check their pollution levels using equipment like smoke metre and exhaust analyser instead of just depending on the pollution certificates issued by private pollution checking centres. Sector 39 RWA president Amardeep alleged that majority of the autorickshaws plying in the city were owned by officials of Chandigarh police due to which they don't prefer taking any action against them. He proposed that Foswac should demand CBI inquiry to ascertain the number of autorickshaws owned by cops. He also said that traffic lights of the city should remain operational during peak hours.

East Coast Railway to replace generator cars in bid to save cost,"BHUBANESWAR: The East Coast Railway (ECoR) officials are planning to save about Rs 40 crore a year by running passenger trains on a system called head on generation (HOG). It has already started replacing the old system with HOG in nine trains on a pilot basis. At present, trains run on a system called end on generation or EOG. Through this technology, the two power generator cars installed in a train convert direct current coming from the engine into alternate current for the consumption of coaches. /The power cars use diesel alternator sets for this. But in the new system, power will be drawn from the overhead electric (OHE) supply directly. This technology will help do away with the two power generator cars that used to make a lot of noise and emit smoke. Official sources said, ""There will be a standby silent generator car for emergency and the second power car will be replaced with a passenger coach."" ECoR chief spokesperson JP Mishra said, ""Doing away with the diesel-run generator will lead to less air pollution and noise pollution. The replacement of power cars with passenger coaches will create a scope for additional earnings for the Railways."" The railway zone started installing the HOG system from August this year. So far, 17 rakes of nine major trains are running on the new system. ""Sixteen more rakes will be fitted with this new technology by the end of this year,"" a senior railway officer said. It has helped ECoR save fuel costs to the tune of around Rs 3.2 crore between August 17 and November 10. ""This apart, we can accommodate more people in the train with an extra coach fitted in the place of a power car,"" Mishra said. The ECoR has around 100 originating passenger trains.

Share of stubble burning may go up to 13% today,"New Delhi: The rising impact of stubble burning on Delhi's air pollution has sent fear levels among civic agencies and residents soaring. With less farm fires and ""poor"" air in circulation, they had heaved a sigh of relief for the past two days. But now, they apprehend the air quality to get fouler.The contribution of stubble emission to Delhi's PM2.5 was 2% on Sunday, which escalated by over 4 times to 9% on Monday. /SAFAR predicts it to touch 13 % by Tuesday. ""Another factor working towards the deterioration of air quality is the change in stubble transport level winds to northwest (coming from Punjab and Haryana) and an increase in effective fire counts to 610. At the transport level, very strong winds are predicted to slow down to moderate level favouring intrusion in Delhi,"" SAFAR stated on Monday.Burning biomass emit large amounts of pollutants. Exposure to carbon dioxide can lead to a number of health problems, including headache, nausea, dizziness, reduced mental alertness, cardiovascular diseases, heart attack and impaired fetal development. In higher concentration, it can even cause death.According to a recent assessment by TERI, if proactive actions are taken the impact of stubble burning in adjoining states of Delhi can be brought down by 40% during the days of peak burning activity.Key recommendations to control crop burning include enabling biomass aggregation and collection by mandating state or central organisations and creating special credit line for financing farm equipment.""To enable biomass aggregation and collection, there is a need to mandate state or national organisation (NAFED, HAFED PAIC) and aggregate crop residue, create special credit line or scheme for financing farm equipment and working capital for private sector participation (IREDA, NABARD, etc). To create a market for biomass briquettes, mandate use of crop residue for co-firing in Punjab and Haryana-owned thermal power plants, include 100% paddy-straw based bio-electricity plant in Haryana and Punjab and announce feed-in tariff for discoms,"" TERI pointed out. The recommendations also bat for local market for bio-gas from paddy straw.According to satellite analysis carried out by the ministry of environment, Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Patiala accounted for most fire counts in Punjab in 2019.

Sale of air-purifying plants on a rise to combat pollution,"Diwali came and went, leaving behind a choking pall of smoke and dust in the city. Then came cyclone Bulbul and blew it all away. But the lack of adequate green cover, unbridled urbanisation and a boom in vehicular pollution have brought the smog back. The city's pollution level, which had fallen below harmful levels following the cyclone, is back to haunt us. And the only way to ensure a better future is to plant more trees and increase the green cover around us. /While it's not always possible to do that on a large scale, we can always start at home. And as luck would have it, nature already has a treasure trove of plants that not only produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide, but are also efficient at removing pollutants from the ambient air. All you need to do is plant a few at home, especially if you have kids around.Demand for air purifiers on a riseGreen spaces (both indoor and outdoor) are a source of wellness for all living beings, including humans. And gradually, people are waking up to this concept. Mr Pawan Gadia, CEO of a flower and plants boutique chain, said, ""We have noticed that people have become more health conscious these days. They have learnt about serious problems like respiratory infections, pulmonary diseases and heart diseases, which rise due to pollution. Hence, they have started keeping more and more air-purifying plants, like peace lily, snake plant, money plant, areca palm and spider plant in their homes to fight indoor pollution to a great extent. These plants absorb toxic chemicals present in the air and also improve the quality of air. We have actually collected data and found that since Diwali, our plant sales have gone up by 20%. Earlier, we used to ship around 1,000 plants a day. Now, we ship about 12,000 plants every day.""Though winter is the season of flowers and people usually buy rose, marigold, petunia and zinnia, this year is witnessing a new trend.

I suggest, we all should have at least some indoor plants at our homes and workspaces to curb that,"" suggested the actor.'Plants are natural air purifiers'A lot of research has gone into the benefits of plants and human health. Subir Bera, a professor of botany and programme coordinator at Calcutta University, said, ""Not just outdoors, a new study has revealed that air inside homes in cities have become unsafe with high levels of pollutants found in it. You spend about 80% of your time indoors - be it at home or in office. Indoor air pollution can increase the risk of stroke, respiratory infections in children, heart disease etc. Plants are natural air purifiers. They can help remove dangerous compounds from fuels, furnishings and clothing. Plants like alfalfa, petunia, red kidney bean and cotton plant can absorb and accumulate sulphur dioxide that emit from fireworks. Another pollutant - carbon monoxide - is removed and degraded before their accumulation in roots of plants like spider plant, bamboo palm, corn plant, snake plant, gerbera daisy and so on.""'Greenery has a therapeutic effect on our mind and body'The best part about indoor plants is that they are resilient and low-maintenance. These plants not just add a dash of style to an otherwise dull indoor space, but also help purify the ambient air and make you feel refreshed.

Even Feng Shui enthusiasts give this plant a lot of importance.Areca PalmIt is a great choice when it comes to eliminating toxins and adding beauty to your home. It is known to absorb poisonous gases, such as carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, xylene, and toluene from the air. In return, it gives out clean oxygen.Spider PlantAccording to the studies by NASA, three houseplants were tested for their ability to remove formaldehyde from the air and it was found out that the spider plant was the champ among them. It also removes contaminants from the air, such as ammonia and benzene. The spider plant can thrive in indirect sunlight and survive in temperature as low as two degrees.Money PlantApart from bringing in good fortune and prosperity, the money plant absorbs the chemical toxins from the air, such as formaldehyde, toluene, benzene, trichloroethylene, and xylene and releases fresh oxygen to breathe.Peace LilyThis is a fairly large plant. It has the ability to break down and neutralise toxic gases found in the air such as formaldehyde, benzene, and carbon monoxide. This plant is ideal for any office space without big windows. Its long green leaves improve energy flow and detoxify the air. It's a low-maintenance plant that can be watered once a week.Rubber plantThese are evergreen plants from India. Their roots grow upwards and often become entwined around the plant's trunk, forming interesting shapes. Rubber plants eliminate carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene and more.Snake PlantKnown as mother-in-law's tongue, it is a hardy succulent. According to studies by NASA, the snake plant is known to remove toxins from the air, such as xylene, formaldehyde, toluene and nitrogen dioxide.

"Early detection essential to manage COPD, say doctors","Visakhapatnam: Much more complicated and riskier than asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive inflammatory lung disease that includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis and is one of the leading causes of death in recent times.On the occasion of World COPD Day (November 20), doctors say besides cigarette smoking, exposure to certain toxic industrial chemicals and atmospheric pollution has also aggravated the instances of COPD. Prevention and early detection are most essential for management of the disease, they say.""While asthma can be seasonal and may or may not be related to smoking, COPD is linked to active and passive smoking. Prolonged exposure to industrial and air pollution can also lead to COPD. /At times, due to genetic factors like deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin enzyme deficiency, lung elasticity is lost, causing respiratory problems or obstructive airflow from lungs,"" says Dr K Phanender, civil surgeon pulmonologist at ESI hospital in the city.Speaking about the symptoms, Dr K S Phaneendra Kumar, consultant pulmonologist at Kims Icon hospital, says sneezing, chronic cough with expectoration, shortness of breath and wheezing (whistling sounds during breathing) are all symptoms of the disease. ""COPD not only damages the lungs but in advanced stages, it can affect other organs such as heart and nervous system,"" he says.COPD can be diagnosed by clinical examination, knowing about the person's medical history, like if he or she was into smoking and/or allergic to any pollutant or allergens. An x-ray report can also help as unlike in asthma patients, change in the shape of chest is noticed in COPD cases, where the chest becomes cylindrical. A simple non-invasive lung function test called spirometry can also determine the presence of COPD, which usually affects patients above 40 years with a smoking history, unlike asthma, which affects even children.

Air pollution may worsen chronic pulmonary ailment,"Jaipur: Air pollution has become a major cause of concern for doctors treating patients with asthma and especially Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Since Rajasthan is among the states worst affected with COPD, health experts have advised people to take precautions when quality of air deteriorates. According to the health experts, COPD is affecting more lives. /""If a patient of COPD remains exposed to polluted air for a long time, his condition deteriorates significantly. People with COPD should remain aware and take immediate help of their physicians to prevent mortality due to the disease,"" said Dr Deepak Yaduvanshi, consultant and in-charge, respiratory medicine at a private hospital. He said that there is a need to regularly check the level of oxygen to prevent mortality due to COPD. Death due to COPD is based on the degree of worsening signs of COPD such as oxygen levels being lower than normal, wheezing and rapid shallow breathing. However, doctors pointed out that earlier the diagnosis of the disease, the better will be its management. ""COPD is irreversible. It cannot be cured but it can be managed. Early diagnosis is the key in proper management of the disease. Spirometry is the most common lung function test, which measures the air flow from the lungs,"" said Dr Virendra Singh, pulmonologist and former superintendent, SMS Hospital.

They said that smoking and usage of tobacco products also cause the disease. /Dr Veerottam Tomer, a city-based pulmonologist, said, ""COPD is caused mainly due to air pollution or smoking. In the beginning, the patient generally neglects the cough considering it as common cold. Later, he/she starts facing breathlessness and considers it a problem of old age. If diagnosed at this stage, one can lead a normal life without any problem after taking the necessary medication."" Dr Raj Kumar, Meerut chief medical officer, said, ""The disease can occur in both smokers and non-smokers. Medicines are mandatory to cure the disease or else it can have an impact on the heart too leading to pulmonary hypertension, which can turn critical.""Tomer said, ""Due to routine hazardous jobs or breathing-related infections, the working rate of the lungs of a person decreases over time and leads to COPD. One should not try to treat cough with sputum - for over two weeks - at home and should rather see a doctor.""  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Delhites may lose 17 years of their lives due to air pollution, finds study","Air pollution levels in the national capital are at an all-time high. With almost every region in the city recording bad air quality, Delhi is turning into a gas chamber. If you thought not being able to breathe properly or burning eyes and headaches are the only thing to worry about, think again.In what may be more shocking news, a study says that citizens living in Delhi might be losing as many as 17 years of their lives if pollution levels continue to cross the 'danger' mark. /According to a new report, people living in the city are currently breathing air which is 25 times more toxic than the permissible limits issued by the World Health Organisation. This spike in the bad air quality is now taking a direct toll on the life expectancy levels.Perhaps the most concerning cause of rising toxic pollution levels is the PM 2.5 particles found in the smog, which can easily enter through the bloodstream and settle in the lungs and nasal cavities and lead to fatal problems. PM 2.5 is the most dangerous pollutant in the air. It is also capable of creating clots, blocking the blood flow and even lead to worsening of conditions like heart attack and severe pulmonary infections. Another report pointed out to pollution impacting people's immunity and inflammation, making them more likely to gain weight.Experts based out of University of Chicago, in one of their researchers also analyzed that of all the top polluted cities in the world, residents of Delhi will get to live for ten years fewer because of the bad pollution levels, while residents of Beijing and Los Angeles (considered to be pollution hotspots too) will live for six and one year fewer respectively.A report released this year titled ""State of Global Air"" further states that pollution is the fifth leading cause of mortality all around the world:""Air pollution is the fifth leading risk factor for mortality worldwide. It is responsible for more deaths than many better-known risk factors such as malnutrition, alcohol use, and physical inactivity. Each year, more people die from air pollution-related disease than from road traffic injuries or malaria.""As the government declares it a public health emergency, this goes on to prove that it's a sad world we are living in.If you haven't thought of investing in a good pollution-fighting mask or limiting your exposure, think again. Smog is extremely risky for people who have breathing issues, low immunity or have weak lungs. Pregnant women, older people and those who are at the risk of chronic infections should exercise the utmost caution before stepping out to avoid endangering their lives.Pollution levels also carry greater risks for expecting mothers and children. Suffocating concentrates of carbon monoxides in the polluted air can ruin the blood supply, stop oxygen from reaching the cells and potentially hamper brain development. Doctors also say that the spike in bad air is bringing in more babies between the ages of 0-6 months to the hospital, with more frequent complaints of lung infections and breathing issues.

Gurgaon's air is turning toxic again as wind speed drops,"Gurgaon: After a brief respite for two days from the toxic haze that enveloped Delhi-NCR, the city's air pollution level rose by 80% on Wednesday. The air quality index (AQI), which was recorded at 221 (poor), had been in the 'moderate' zone for the past three days - 125 (moderate) on Tuesday, 136 on Monday and 138 on Sunday. The air quality in the national capital entered the 'very poor' zone on Wednesday, and is likely to turn 'severe' over the next two days owing to calm winds and an increase in burning of crop residues. Delhi's AQI was recorded at 301 at 4pm on Wednesday, up from 242 at 4pm on Tuesday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The AQI in other NCR cities - Faridabad, Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida - remained higher than that of Gurgaon. /The AQI in Faridabad, Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida was recorded at 273 (poor), 320 (very poor), 366 (very poor), 340 (very poor) respectively. The index was clocked at 205 (poor) in Manesar industrial belt. According to the Met department, continuously declining wind speed is responsible for deteriorating air quality. ""As the wind direction has also changed, it has made the situation worse. That's why a sudden increase in air pollution has been recorded,"" said a Met official, adding that ""the wind speed is likely to come down again on Thursday, preventing dispersal of air pollutants."" The government's air quality monitoring and forecasting service SAFAR said the highest level of PM2.5 was recorded at 174 micrograms per cubic metre (moderate) at 6pm in the city. Even though the air quality has improved in the last couple of days, the Supreme Court-mandated panel - EPCA - had on Monday released special directives retaining a few graded response action plan (GRAP) restrictions for next three days (from November 19 to November 21) after the meteorological department had alerted it that the wind speed would go down in the region. According to the SAFAR forecast, the air quality may remain in the 'very poor' zone in the city on Thursday and Friday. The AQI is likely to remain between 297 and 372 in the next 48 hours. While Delhi-NCR's average PM2.5 was 156 micrograms per cubic metre at 7pm on Wednesday, the average PM10 concentration was 276 micrograms per cubic metre. According to a Met official, the air quality is getting fouler due to low wind speed (6-8km per hour). ""Similar surface wind speed is expected tomorrow and air quality drop tomorrow and day after. From November 23 onwards, the wind speed will go up to 15-20km per hour, which will further go up to 25km/hour on November 24-25, which will improve the air quality again. On 26th, light rain and high wind speed is expected,"" the official told TOI.Wednesday was also the coldest day this season as minimum temperature clocked 11.4 degrees Celsius, one notch below normal. The maximum temperature was 28.9, one degree Celsius above normal. Humidity levels oscillated between 93 and 39%. ""During low minimum temperature, dispersion gets slower and air quality deteriorates. In the next three days, however, it will again rise up to 15 degrees Celsius,"" the official said. ""Improvement in air quality is expected by Saturday due to increase in wind speed owing to fresh westerly disturbances,"" a SAFAR report stated. Stubble burning instances are, meanwhile, on the rise. ""However, transport level winds are likely to be highly variable in direction and may not bring significant stubble impact to Delhi on Thursday.""  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Mumbai: Air turns nippy and traps pollutants as winter kicks in,"MUMBAI: As the temperature in the city dips and winter sets in, air pollution levels have begun to rise. After months of good to moderate air quality index (AQI), Mumbai's AQI on Thursday turned 'poor' according to data of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). On Thursday morning, System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) also recorded an AQI of 199, only two units short of the 'poor' category./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/An AQI between 201and 300 is considered 'poor'. People with heart or lung disease, older adults and children should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion. According to CPCB, the AQI on Thursday morning was 217 which improved to 202 by evening. Since last month, the CPCB is collating data from Mumbai's 10 stations for its daily bulletin.Similarly, SAFAR's real time monitoring at 10 locations recorded an AQI of 199 in the morning, which improved to 187 by evening. The last time the city experienced 'poor' AQI was on March 24 this year when the AQI was 254. It has been in the 'good' (0-100) and 'moderate' categories due to the monsoon.On Thursday, among 10 locations monitored by SAFAR, Bandra-Kurla Complex recorded the worst AQI of 311 which is 'very poor'. Bhandup with an AQI of 91 had the cleanest air. The other locations recorded an AQI in the 'moderate' category.Researchers at SAFAR said the 'poor' air quality can be attributed to weather conditions. ""As the rains have made an exit and temperature dips, pollutants get suspended closer to the earth's surface, thus resulting in a higher AQI. It is expected to remain in the same range throughout winter,"" said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR.Activists feel attention needs to be drawn to Mumbai's pollution levels. ""The myth is that the city's air quality is not as bad as Delhi's... But there is a haze which many in Mumbai are seeing after sunset when temperatures dip... We must be asking authorities and ourselves why are we breathing this polluted air,"" said Ruhie Kumar, climate change campaigner. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

He has recently started using an N-95 mask on duty but his condition hasn't improved. While pain in the back and the knee is common for traffic cops, over the last three years, like Kumar, many other cops have developed respiratory ailments including pulmonary allergies, throat pain and asthma because of the rising air pollution levels, and have been forced to seek medical help.The city-based doctors say prolonged exposure to pollutants is making them prone to allergies, breathlessness and reduced lung capacity. /Vaibhav Gupta, senior physician at Medanta hospital, said, ""We are seeing a sudden rise in the number of traffic policemen turning up at the OPD with respiratory problems. They are complaining of loss of stamina or acute asthma attacks, and sometimes, pneumonia. In the long run, these policemen are likely to develop heart diseases and lung cancer,"" he said. The traffic cops have to stand for around 8 hours a day with little or no protection at all. As per the meteorological department, the situation will only worsen in the coming months as a cold wave is going to hit north India.Another traffic inspector, who did not wish to be named said, ""All of us feel low on energy and out of breath by the time we reach home. During this time of the year, almost all of our officers are suffering from chronic cough, itchy eyes and breathing problem.""DCP (traffic) Himanshu Garg told TOI that the department provides masks to the traffic cops on duty. ""We procure masks and distribute among the traffic cops so that they can protect themselves from air pollution. Also, although every cop has to be on duty for 12 hours, there are traffic booths where we can take rest every 3-4 hours, and whenever the traffic is less,"" he said.

100 firemen spray water at 13 pollution hotspots,"New Delhi: Delhi Fire Services has been roped in to fight air pollution at the 13 hotspots identified by the environment department. DFS has deployed 20 fire tenders and nearly 100 men to spray water with fire hoses on roads and trees at these hotspots to wash away dust and smoke residue. /The teams might be deployed at more spots if required. Chief fire officer Atul Garg said that the fire department is analysing the fire calls to decide on the number of vehicles to deployed for pollution control measures. At any point of time, 200 fire engines are kept active all over Delhi.For the next two days, the anti-pollution teams will be deployed around Anand Vihar, Vivek Vihar, Rohini, Dwarka, Punjabi Bagh, Okhla and industrial zones where the amount of dust content in the atmosphere is higher. The measures were initiated on Saturday on the directions of the Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev. A DPCC official said the drive will continue until pollution levels come down considerably. ""Air quality is starting to improve, however, sustained efforts are required to control it further. We are targeting other sources of pollution as well, which include garbage burning, C&D waste and industries that have not switched to PNG,"" said the DPCC official. Special drives have also been initiated by transport department and traffic police against use of adulterated fuels and kerosene, while visibly polluting vehicles are being fined Rs 1 lakh on the spot. ""The fines are Rs 1 lakh for heavy duty vehicles and Rs 50,000 for light commercial vehicles,"" said the official.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"AQI touches 407, city struggles for fresh air","PATNA: Patna recorded the worst air quality in the country on Saturday and slipped into the ""severe"" category. The air quality index (AQI) of the city was recorded at 407. AQI above 400 is considered severe.As per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which releases the daily AQI bulletin, ""severe"" air quality affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases. AQIs of Muzaffarpur and Gaya, on the other hand, were recorded at 397 and 304, respectively.The air quality of Patna has sharply deteriorated over the past few days. /From 323 on Monday, the AQI of Patna surged to around 370 on Friday and 407 on Saturday. The AQIs of Muzaffarpur and Gaya are also being recorded above 300.The AQI is an assessment of the air quality taking into account eight pollutants: PM 2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns), PM 10 (particulate matter less than 10 microns), nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, ammonia and lead.PM 2.5, which invade human lungs and can also cause cancer, is the biggest contributor to air pollution in Patna. The level of PM 2.5 at Patna on Saturday evening was 263.48 micrograms per cubic metre, which was over four times the normal figure of 60 micrograms per cubic metre.Experts attributed the severe air quality in Patna on Saturday to low wind speed and high level of humidity. The situation is getting aggravated by formation of fog in the region.The daily weather bulletin issued by Patna Meteorological Centre on Saturday stated that shallow fog was observed at one or two places in the state in the morning hours. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its all-India weather bulletin issued on Saturday evening stated that shallow to moderate fog was expected in Bihar over the next 24 hours.""Almost calm winds along with high level of moisture and foggy mornings are not allowing the suspended particulate matter or PM 2.5 to disperse. The situation can improve only when the wind speed will increase or moisture level come down,"" said Pradhan Parth Sarthi, professor of environmental science department at Central University of South Bihar.Patna is infamous for witnessing poor air quality during peak winter months of November, December and January and PM 2.5 is found to be the major pollutant on most days. The AQI mostly hovers in the range between 300 and 400 in the city.The alluvial soil due to the location of the city on the banks of the Ganga and close to the foothills of Himalayas has also been cited as reasons for high level of suspended particulate matter, which deteriorates the air quality.

Silent killer: Toxic air may just give you a heart attack,"Hyderabad: While most people associate air pollution with lung diseases, an international research study has equated toxic air to a spike in cardiovascular diseases in Hyderabad.Findings of the study were cited at a global conference on Sunday, where experts were discussing factors responsible for a rise in heart diseases. The research was conducted by Barcelona Institute of Global Health (ISGlobal) as part of the cardiovascular health effects of air pollution in Telangana.An international team of researchers measured the carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) (width of the inner layers of the carotid artery and a major marker of thickening of the artery walls) of 3,372 patients from peri-urban regions of Hyderabad and estimated their exposure to air pollution.""It was found that 60% of the participants were regularly exposed to biomass cooking fuel and 21% were affected by the obesogenic environment,"" stated the study. It also revealed that women were at higher risk than men, as they spent more time in the kitchen and inhaled air polluted by biomass fuel.In Hyderabad, 20,000 new cardiac cases are reported every year and many among them turn out to be fatal. /Elaborating on the deteriorating air quality in winter, a source from Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) said that the conditions will worsen as the weather becomes colder, because the polluting particles settle down during winter. ""Particulate matter levels have gone up and there is a drastic increase in the level of major pollutants in the city over the past few years,"" added the source.Emphasising on the need for early detection, doctors attributed the rise in cases of heart diseases to poor lifestyle of many people in urban areas, lack of physical activities and awareness.""Early detection of diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol levels, lung and kidney-related ailments and lifestyle changes such as avoiding active and passive smoking and regular check-ups can help with better diagnosis,"" said Dr V Rajasekhar, senior interventional cardiologist & electrophysiologist, Yashoda Hospitals, Secunderabad.At the two-day conference & live workshop on 'advanced interventional cardiology', organised by Yashoda Hospitals, involving 500 experts from across the globe, experts highlighted how the number of deaths due to cardiac problems was rising despite improvement in technology and quality of medical care.""An annual average exposure to PM2.5 in low income and middle-income countries of South Asia is around 32.7 microgram per cubic metre, which is far above the WHO recommended a maximum level of 10 microgram per cubic metre,"" said K Cherian, member, World Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons (WSCS).""The linkages between air pollution and cardiovascular diseases can be seen in countries such as India, which are experiencing a sharp rise in hypertension, diabetes and obesity.

"Toxic air: Traffic cops, vendors worst sufferers","PATNA: There are some who, at times, avoid venturing outside in polluted air, but traffic constables, street vendors, delivery boys and rickshaw-pullers have no other choice except getting exposed to air pollution in order to earn their livelihood. With polluted air returning to haunt the city, people who stand on roads for hours to discharge their duties have started facing respiratory and other disorders.The kind of trouble such people face due to the polluted air can be gauged from the fact that the city air on Monday was equivalent to smoking around 11 cigarettes. A California-based research states that inhaling one cigarette is equivalent to 22 micrograms particulate matter (PM 2.5 per cubic metre g/m of air). The level of PM 2.5 on Monday was 240, which, according to the formulae, translated into 10.9 cigarettes. /A traffic constable at Income-Tax roundabout said he has been facing respiratory problems since the last one month. ""This happens almost every year. However, I have developed breathing problems due to severe pollution this time. The doctor has advised me to wear anti-pollution masks during duty hours,"" he added.Another traffic cop at Dak Bungalow crossing said, ""I cannot avoid work because of polluted air. It's difficult to breathe. For us, anti-pollution masks are the only saviours. I always request my colleagues to wear masks while on duty.""The state police headquarters has also advised traffic cops to wear anti-pollution masks. ""We are encouraging police personnel, especially traffic police, to use masks while on duty in a bid to avoid diseases like asthma and pneumonia,"" said Jitendra Kumar, city SP (east).Similarly, street vendors, shopkeepers and delivery boys, who are exposed to polluted air, have also expressed their helplessness. Some of them said they avoid wearing pollution masks as they are uncomfortable.""Earlier, I had no idea what was happening and why my ears and nose were getting blocked. However, I have now realised that air pollution is responsible for it,"" said Shambhu, a tea-seller on Bailey Road.Rickshaw-pullers, too, are breathing the same toxic air. ""Being an asthma patient, I easily get affected by dust and other pollutants. I suffered an attack last week and stopped working in commercial areas,"" said Pankaj Kumar, a rickshaw-puller at Kadamkuan.At medicine shops, anti-pollution masks are in short supply.

The air in Muzaffarpur fell in ""very poor"" category, which, according to CPCB, can lead to respiratory illness on prolonged exposure.Patna and Muzaffarpur have been witnessing highly polluted air since the advent of winter conditions around Diwali.The AQI is an assessment of the air quality taking into account eight pollutants - PM 2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns), PM 10 (particulate matter less than 10 microns), nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, ammonia and lead.PM 2.5, according to experts, is the biggest contributor to air pollution in Patna and Muzaffarpur. As per the automatic air quality monitoring station at Indira Gandhi Science Complex, the average level of concentration of PM 2.5 on Monday was measured at 240 micrograms per cubic metre.Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh attributed surge in AQI to combined impact of several factors, including bio-mass burning, low temperature, high level of moisture and low wind velocity.""The level of major pollutants, primarily PM 2.5, has not increased much, but the variables have changed lately. /Local factors, such as burning of wood and dry fodder in the neighbouring villages along with gradual plunge in temperature and high level of humidity have aggravated the situation,"" Ghosh told TOI.""As per comprehensive clean air action plan for Patna, which was released last week, domestic burning contributes 2% of the total air pollution in the city. People continue to use earthen stoves for cooking purpose and burn wood or coal despite getting free LPG connection under Ujjwala scheme because they can't afford to refill it. People also burn dry leaves and fodder in the villages to keep themselves warm amid the plunging mercury. All these factors are responsible for severe air pollution in Patna,"" Ghosh added.Asked about the preventive steps being taken to curb air pollution, Ghosh said, ""CM Nitish Kumar had recently issued several directives to the officials concerned to curb air pollution in the city. However, implementation of the measures recommended by the state government is not up to the mark.

"Delhi worse than hell, people are living in gas chamber: SC","NEW DELHI: Noting that 45% of its garbage remained unattended and piled up on roads even as Delhi had virtually been converted into a gas chamber, the Supreme Court said on Monday that the city was no longer liveable and had become worse than ""narak"" (hell) with people dying of various ailments due to pollution./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/The apex court, which has been fulminating over lack of official intent, expressed anguish that governments had failed to act to deal with pollution and the situation was worsening with time despite it passing a series of orders over the years. It accused the Centre and Delhi government of politicising the issue instead of cooperating to come to the rescue of the capital's residents.When Delhi chief secretary noted that 45% of garbage was not being lifted by civic agencies, an annoyed bench burst out, asking why the government should not kill people in one go by using explosives instead of letting them die slowly in a gas chamber.The SC asked the Centre to decide within 10 days on setting up smog towers across the city to purify the air.2 power centres are hurting city: Chief secy in SCThe Supreme Court said smog towers, set up China, were proving to be successful in dealing with pollution. ""There is no question of testing it before making it operational. It is just lack of will power on the part of government. You sit together and prepare a plan on how many and where these towers should be set up,"" the bench said and added that other technology like anti-smog guns should also be examined.The court lamented that no government wanted to take anti-populist measures. ""You are not sitting together but are blaming each other. The issue of pollution is being politicised and it is happening under the nose of the court. We would not tolerate it. Blame game is not serving the people of Delhi... We cannot allow people to die,"" a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta said.Explaining steps taken to deal with 13 pollution hotspots, the Delhi chief secretary informed the court all steps were being taken to keep the city clean. Facing the ire of the court, he admitted Delhi was facing a governance problem due to two power centres. He hinted that differences between the Centre and Delhi government were affecting proper administration.The bench made it clear that this couldn't be an excuse for the administration's inaction and directed both governments to keep aside their differences and work for the welfare of people.It slammed Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana for failing to implement its order to stop stubble burning, which aggravates pollution levels in NCR. SC said it was high time to make state governments and officers responsible for not providing clean air and water. It issued notice to all states seeking a reply on why they should not be liable to pay compensation for pollution-borne diseases like cancer.The court also decided to examine the pollution problem in other cities.

Track the pollution level in your city,Patna gasps for breath as AQI zooms to 419,"PATNA: There is no respite from toxic air for residents of Patna and Muzaffarpur as the two cities continued to occupy top two slots in the country in terms of air pollution for the second consecutive day on Tuesday.As per the daily bulletin issued by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) level of Patna stood at 419 on Tuesday, the highest this season. The increase in AQI level in the state capital in the last 24 hours was 15 units as it was recorded at 404 on Monday.The AQI level in Muzaffarpur, on the other hand, also surged from 393 on Monday to 402 on Tuesday. The air quality in both Patna and Muzaffarpur was in ""severe"" category on Tuesday. /As per CPCB, severe air quality affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases.Residents of the state capital have started complaining about breathing discomforts and other respiratory ailments due to air pollution. ""Though breathing in other parts of the city is not that difficult, I definitely start coughing in Dak Bungalow and Income-Tax localities of the city. I have started wearing N95 while riding bike,"" said Amit Kumar, sales executive of a private firm.Many people, especially senior citizens, have stopped morning walks. ""My doctor has suggested me either to stop morning walks for a few days or go for the walk a bit late, when the visibility is better. It seems as if Delhi-like smog has enveloped in the city,"" said B N Singh, a retired bank employee and resident of Ashiana Nagar.Doctors have certain suggestions for people to tackle air pollution. ""People should avoid early morning walks and go for it only after the visibility improves as the dust particles or particulate matter present in the air near the ground level can be inhaled while breathing. Besides, people breathe heavily while exercising or jogging, which can aggravate the possibility of invasion of dust particles in lungs,"" said city-based physician Dr Diwakar Tejashwi, adding that people should wear N 95 masks at the crowded places.Air pollution usually aggravates in Patna with drop in temperature and formation of fog. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), in its weather bulletin issued on Tuesday evening, stated that shallow to moderate fog would prevail at isolated places on the state over the next two to three days.According to experts, particulate matter less than 2.5 microns or PM 2.5 settle in the moisture near the ground level during foggy conditions, which, in turn, worsens the air quality. The average level of PM 2.5 in Patna on Tuesday was measured at around 230 micrograms per cubic metre, nearly four times the normal level of 60 micrograms per cubic metre.Farmers to face action for stubble burning: Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal held a meeting on Tuesday to discuss the issue of stubble burning. He asked all district magistrates under Patna division to identify farmers indulged in stubble burning and cancel their registration for availing different schemes of the state government under direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme for a period of three years. According to Bihar State Pollution Control Board, domestic burning contributes around 22% of air pollution in Patna. This includes crop stubble burning in villages around the state capital.

Use masks to avoid inhaling polluted air: MPCB tells residents,"Kolhapur: The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has appealed the citizens residing in the areas affected due to smoke emanating from the dumping yard to use masks for avoiding health issues arising due to inhaling polluted air. The MPCB has also directed the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) to take immediate steps to douse the fire and get rid of the waste piled up at the dumping site in Kasba Bawda. The direction and the appeal came after several activists and citizens met MPCB officials seeking immediate and strict action against the civic body for causing air pollution and putting the lives of the residents in danger. /The garbage at the dumping site had caught fire about 10 days ago. Ever since, the smoke emanating from the dumping site has engulfed the surroundings. The areas badly-affected by the smoke include Kasba Bawda, Line Bazar, Kadamwadi, Sadar Bazar, Dabholkar Corner, Tarabai Park and Nagala Park. MPCB officials assured the activists that the samples of the polluted areas will be taken in a few days and the test reports of the same will be made public. On November 25, TOI had reported about the deterioration of the air quality in the area, based on the details gathered from MPCB. Prashant Gaikwad, sub-regional officer of MPCB, said, ""We have taken serious cognizance of the fire at the Kasba Bawda dumping site. We have asked the civic administration to take immediate steps to douse the fire as the smoke emanating from it is causing inconvenience to the locals.

In the latest report published by the Lung Care Foundation (LCF), an association of leading doctors across the country, it has been revealed that the number of patients hospitalized for respiratory ailments went up from 22% in 2016 to 33% in 2017. ""Cases of respiratory tract illness increase during winter or, in case of those suffering from ailments like COPD and asthma, the symptoms aggravate during this season. But what concerns us is the rise in the proportion of such patients over the years,"" said Dr Raja Dhar. /The pulmonologist with Fortis Hospital Anandapur is part of Lung Care Foundation.According to health experts, the rising air quality index (AQI) level is causing respiratory tract illness in patients across all ages. ""This time around, we started getting cases of viral pneumonia earlier than usual, right after Durga Puja. Right now, our ICU is full and a good umber of the patients comprise children suffering from respiratory syncytial virus. Rising pollution and change of season are the leading causes,"" said Dr Prabhas Prasun Giri, paediatric ICU in charge at Institute of Child Health.While new cases are being detected, the rising AQI is aggravating the problem in patients who had already been suffering from respiratory illness. As a result, many are requiring hospitalization or are rushing to the doctor in the OPD. Hospitals across the city have been witnessing about 30% to 50% surge in patients with respiratory ailments in the past few weeks.""The worry is that adults who are non-smokers and children are being affected. The situation has turned worse in the past five years. That is the reason why the vulnerable group, specially the elderly population, needs to be vaccinated,"" said Dr Mrinmoy Mitra, pulmonologist at AMRI Hospital, Mukundapur.Since Diwali, the AQI had dipped steeply in Kolkata, with various places in the city and surrounding areas crossing the 300 mark, especially during the morning hours. The limit recommended by World Health Organisation is 101-200. ""November, December and January are the months when air pollution is at its worst because of temperature inversion. But now, rapid urbanisation - construction projects, including Metro, and polluting vehicles - is adding to the problem and turning the AQI bad,"" said Dhar.The pulmonologist cited studies that have found Metro construction is responsible for increasing particulate matter with toxic metal - 45% higher than the standard level.

"Docs seek separate healthcare for rural, tribals & ayurveda","Nagpur: The Maha Vikas Aghadi announced three major initiaitives in healthcare under its Common Minimum Programme (CMP) before swearing-in of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray as the chief minister on Thursday.The medical fraternity welcomed 'One Rupee Clinics at taluka level', Super Specialty Hospital (SSH) and Government Medical College and Hospital at each district and health insurance for all. At the same time, doctors said the new government must also focus on special tribal medical college, separate tribal health policy, sufficient number of doctors and inclusion of ayurveda and panchkarma treatments.Dr Abhay Bang, founder of Gadchiroli-based NGO SEARCH, congratulated the government for the three programmes but appealed for a special rural health care component. ""Tribals are missing in government healthcare initiatives. /Medical insurance is welcome as cost is rising, while SSHs are necessary,"" he said. Dr Bang said the government must go for disease prevention by reducing the causes. ""What is there to cut air pollution, malnutirition, tobacco and alcohol abuse in the schemes? Treating disease is necessary but not sufficient. Prevention programme is needed."" he said.Regarding medical colleges at each district, Dr Bang said, ""You also need medical graduates to go to rural areas and serve. How the government will ensure MBBS graduates go or serve needs to be planned. For the last three years, Gadchiroli district is running Mukti Path. This programme can be applied to other districts,"" he said.Rajya Sabha member and well-known opthalmalogist Dr Vikas Mahatme is concerned about sufficient number of doctors. ""One Rupee clinics is very good as all should get tertiary care. When SSH comes up in Gadchiroli, it will cut stress on Nagpur. But finding doctors is a major issue. A hospital can be built easily but running it smoothly is big challenge for all specialists,"" he said.Dr Mahatme cautioned that the government thinks manpower, especially the specialists, is in their control. ""It needs to raise a cadre. Position and seats will have to be increased. Last government increased 1,500 seats. Like this, it has to be done,"" he said.Melghat-based Dr Rajiv Satav, who is president of Mahan Trust, said tribal health policy should be separate. ""Deaths in most productive age of 16 to 60 years are most common in tribal areas. There is no study or programme on this. If this too happens, it will be really useful,"" he said. Dr Satav also demanded that like district GMCHs, tribal medical colleges should be started so that graduates can serve tribals.Associate professor at Government Ayurveda College Sumeeta Jain said the scheme could help the poor in a big way. ""Primary healthcare will benefit. Those who are needy and really ill will be helped immensely. Major illnesses can be avoided and doctors there can then refer the patients to higher centres.""""Infrastructure is a big problem and if the government is involved, it will prevent unethical practices. The schemes must also have ayurveda and panchkarma treatments in the health cover for non-communicable and lifestyle diseases,"" she said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Bad air: Why your pet is as much at risk as you,"Gurgaon: Tipsy, a three-year-old Pomeranian who stays in Sector 66, was last week diagnosed with asthma. Once an active pooch, Tipsy is now wheezing and coughing almost non-stop. Just the act of breathing is a struggle for her, despite ongoing treatment. Her vet blames the alarming air pollution for Tipsy's condition.The toxic air is causing distress not just to humans but also pets. /Veterinarian doctors in the city say there has been an upturn in cases of asthma, bronchitis and emphysema, due to the high levels of particulate matter and sulphur dioxide at this time of the year. A rise in the level of particulate matter is also linked to cardiac arrest among dogs and cats, while a spike in the concentration of carbon monoxide can affect brain function, besides increasing the risk of tumours among pets.""Air pollution causes severe respiratory distress amongst pets as well; it can lead to choking, breathlessness, wheezing, coughing and even asthma attacks,"" Dr. John Dominic, a veterinarian at CGS Hospital in DLF Phase 3, told TOI. ""After Diwali, we have noticed that mostly brachycephalic breed (short-nosed) dogs like pugs and French bulldogs were affected by firecracker pollution.""According to Dr. Dominic, it's not uncommon to come across dogs being laid low by sudden seizures. And even pet cats, he adds, are vulnerable, the surge in their number resulting in more instances of feline asthma. Indeed, some vets have recorded more cases of cats being struck down by respiratory disorders this year. ""Since cats have less body weight than most breeds of dogs, and their bodies are smaller, they are affected severely by air pollution,"" explains Dr. Shally Mattoo Jalali of the city's SJ's Pet Care.""In the last 30 days, we have recorded 15 to 20 cases of cat patients and 10 to 15 cases of dog patients suffering from respiratory diseases, cough, nasal discharge, and redness and itching in eyes,"" she adds.Naturally, all this has pet parents concerned. ""It all started a day after Diwali. It was extremely difficult for my little one, who had watery eyes and wheezing all the time. Worse, we can't take him out for morning walks which he used to enjoy. The vet has instructed to keep him indoors,"" shared a dejected Latika Oberoi, a pet parent in Sector 55. Vets warn that regular exposure to high levels of air pollution can lead to a recurrence of cases of respiratory illness. ""In longstanding cases where the pet is exposed to unhealthy air over a period of time, chronic changes in the respiratory system can take place - inflammation of the upper respiratory system, chronic cough, bronchitis and asthma attacks are few of the health challenges faced by pets,"" Dr. Dominic informed.Besides, he continued, studies have shown that pets residing in areas where foul air is a constant, are at risk of being afflicted by chronic inflammation of the brain, in addition to lung disease, and reduced lung capacity and functioning. ""Cats living in close proximity to owners who are chronic smokers, are prone to asthma. Therefore, pet parents need to be very careful,"" cautioned Dr. Dominic.Meanwhile, some believe that strays should also be treated during peak pollution season. ""While the impact of air pollution can be reduced as pets can be kept indoors, strays are the ones who suffer the most. Since I feed strays every day, I saw that many suffered burn injuries after Dussehra, Diwali and Chhath Puja,"" revealed Sadhana Gupta, a dog lover in DLF Phase 2.""Wheezing, redness in eyes and difficulty in breathing is also very common among stray dogs. I think the authorities should make sure that strays get at least some sort of treatment when the pollution levels shoot up."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution in Bihar leads to surge in cases of respiratory diseases,"PATNA: Poor air quality is taking its toll on the health of people in Bihar as there has been increase in the cases of respiratory diseases, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). /<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/As per the data of Bihar state health society, the cases of acute respiratory illness (ARI) has increased in Bihar from over 2 lakhs in 2009 to around 11 lakhs in 2018 with declining trends in between. In 2012, there were around 21.06 lakh ARI cases in Bihar, which came down to 18.21 lakh in 2014 and further down to 13.14 lakh in 2016. In 2018, there were 10.96 lakh such patients. Patna also witnessed a similar trend. Though there were 13,774 cases of ARI in 2009, the figure increased to 65,423 in 2012. It started declining from 46,897 cases in 2014 to 20,555 in 2016 and to 8725 in 2018.""We started this data collection in2009; hence, the figure is low for that year. Though the number has decreased over a period of time, the proportion of respiratory illness (RI) cases compared to the total diseases remains the same,"" said state surveillance officer at state health society Dr Ragini Mishra. She said they collect the data of 14 communicable diseases and RI contributed 32% to that. The state health department has recently started collecting data of patients suffering from pulmonary and other respiratory disorders to compare with the air quality index (AQI) in order to assess the actual impact of poor air quality on human health.  Figures are being collected from PMCH, NMCH, IGIMS and AIIMS-Patna with details like the environment in which the patients lived, their family history and whether they smoked or not.  Total 246 cases of respiratory illness (RI) were reported between April and November 4 this year. However, sources in the four hospitals admitted that all such patients were not properly covered due to lack of manpower. The maximum number of RI cases have been reported from Patna (165), followed by 17 from Vaishali, 14 from Nalanda, six from Bhojpur and five each from Saran and Begusarai districts.TB and chest department associate professor at IGIMS Dr Manish Shankar said 50 to 60 patients were coming to the outpatient department with RI daily. ""Hardly 20 to 30 people visited OPD with RI till last year,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Track the pollution level in your city,200 traffic cops in Bengaluru to undergo detailed lung function test,"BENGALURU: Select 200 Bengaluru traffic police working in the most traffic ridden stretches of the city will be undergoing a lung health fest in the next two months with the help of a medical team from HCG private limited, a cancer care hospital. The screening began on Monday, when ten cops underwent the tests. The tests also assesses the carbon monoxide burden on their lungs.Stating that the traffic police personnel are one of the most vulnerable to air pollution due to their exposure to vehicular traffic, dust on the road, Dr Vishal Rao, head and neck surgeon from the hospital mentioned that the health check up will be a preventive step. /Observing the National Pollution Control Day in the memory of those who have lost their lives in the Bhopal Gas tragedy on December 2, 1984, the hospital conducted air pollution awareness drive and lung health tests for the traffic police.""It is known that air pollution is carcinogenic as said by the World Health Organisation. Air pollution can cause cancer, which is completely preventable if measures are initiated to reduce the air pollution. Bengaluru has reached the air quality index of 157 in the last two days which is a worrisome factor,"" said Dr Vishal. The air quality index of 101 to 200 is termed as moderately polluted, which can cause breathing discomfort to people with lung diseases like asthma. Close to 50 percent of the air pollution comes from vehicular emissions, followed by rampant construction activities in the city.Dr Vishal added that various government machineries like pollution control board, urban development department, transport department should come up with an action plan to tackle air pollution. ""HCG is taking steps to help early stages of preventive initiatives to support traffic police in leading healthier lifestyles within their areas of work,"" Dr Vishal said. During the screening programme, the cops will also given N95 anti pollution mask. The hospital will be analysing the health conditions of the traffic cops based on the tests and will shortly be coming up with the findings of the impact of exposure to air pollution shortly. S Somashekaraiah, a traffic police said that it was difficult to stand on street for hours without wearing mask. ""We are exposed to air pollution throughout the working hours. I suggest that the two wheeler riders too wear masks as they are equally vulnerable,"" he said.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Breathing Bidhannagar air worse than smoking: Study,"KOLKATA: High level of abnormality of pulmonary function tests (PFT) on traffic police personnel in Bidhannagar, which is leafier and thus less polluted than core Kolkata, has revealed that breathing the city's air is worse than smoking cigarettes. According to a recent study, the abnormality prevalent in heavy smokers was found in the PFT of these cops, more than 60% of whom are non-smokers.Among 333 participants - mostly traffic constables and civic volunteers from nine traffic guards - who underwent the PFT, 17% were detected with abnormal results. Significantly, the zones where these personnel undertake their traffic management duty are not among the worst polluted zones of the city, said the study conducted by Narayana Hospital and Kolkata Clean Air./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/""PFTs are non-invasive tests that show how well the lungs are working. The tests measure lung volume, capacity and rate of flow, and gas exchange. People with abnormal PFT pump in much less oxygen than what their bodies demand, which gives rise to a series of health issues,"" said Dr S Roy Chowdhury, consultant physical medicine, Narayana Hospital, who led the study.Among the participants, 24% personnel attached with Lake Town and Baguiati traffic guards were found to have abnormal PFT. While 18% of Bidhannagar and Nabadiganta traffic guard personnel had abnormal PFT results, the figure was 16% for New Town and Rajarhat traffic guard personnel. The results were better for airport, Kaikhali and NSCBI traffic guard personnel, where the figure was 9%.Dr P K Hazra, head of cardiology, AMRI Dhakuria said, ""Air pollution is wreaking havoc with our health and the eco-system. Air pollution is changing the genetic expressions of our next generation by epigenetic mechanism. Degraded environment is impacting pregnant women and the foetuses.""""The city's air pollution is the fifth most causal-factor mortality. It is a major threat for acute and chronic respiratory illness and higher cardiac morbidity, increased incidence of cancer and genetic changes, especially in children,"" said Dr Suman Mallik, clinical director and chief of radiation oncology, Narayana Hospital.While Delhi is considered the most polluted city in the world, experts pointed out that Kolkata's air is just as bad. Kolkata's PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentration throughout 2018-19 did not abide by WHO's prescribed limits and the air quality Index (AQI) did not conform to the Central Pollution Control Board's prescribed limits.
