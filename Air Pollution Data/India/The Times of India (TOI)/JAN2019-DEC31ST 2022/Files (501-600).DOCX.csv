"Madhya Pradesh: Covid caution up in smoke, Diwali pollution gets worse","BHOPAL: ""Khub patakhe chalayen (light plenty of firecrackers),"" this was Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra's advice to people on Diwali-eve when daily Covid reports showed grim indications of a rebound./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/Bhopal - and all major cities in MP - seemed to have taken his advice and celebrated Diwali with such abandon that the air quality turned worse than what it was last year. Health experts' warning that winter and Diwali pollution may lead to a Corona disaster went up in smoke.AQI in Bhopal on the morning of Diwali was 158. The next morning, as the haze of fireworks hung over the city, the AQI needle hovered at 209. Last year, the day after Diwali, the AQI was 164. Winter was just setting in then (October 28-29).It was the same story in Indore, Gwalior and Jabalpur. The air was not fit for breathing on Sunday, and yet people began bursting crackers again in the evening.Air quality of Gwalior was 338 around noon on Sunday - the worst in MP and in the 'very poor' category, putting residents at risk of respiratory illness upon prolonged exposure. It was comparable with some areas of Delhi. Indore and Jabalpur's AQI the day after Diwali stood at 237 and 206.Compared to pollution levels of Diwali 2019, the Central Pollution Control Board data suggests that air pollution was nearly twice as bad this year, officials said, adding that appeals to people to avoid crackers went unheeded.MPPCB had issued advisory on cracker 'ban'The state pollution control board had issued repeated advisories to people not to burst crackers this Diwali.On November 9, Bhopal collector Avinash Lavania appealed to citizens to burst crackers only between 8pm and 10pm. But home minister Mishra - who was also health minister during the early days of the pandemic - said there is no such restriction.Asked about the collector's statement, Mishra had told reporters on Friday: ""He must have said it on the basis of some NGT order. Celebrate Diwali with gusto. Light plenty of crackers. There's no time limit. It's our festival, celebrate with joy and enthusiasm (khub dhoom dham se manaye. Khub patakhe chalayen.

Track the pollution level in your city,Air quality in Patna turns 'poor' hours after Diwali celebrations,"PATNA: Hours after Diwali celebrations, the air quality in Patna deteriorated to 'poor' category on Sunday, as people continued to burst firecrackers after 10pm on Saturday.The maximum noise level was recorded near Planetarium and in Patliputra Industrial area from 10pm on Saturday to 6am on Sunday while it was the minimum around Boring Road, areas near Beltron Bhawan and Parivesh Bhawan during the same period, as per the information provided by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB).The overall air quality index (AQI) of Patna plunged from 215 on Saturday to 275 at 4pm on Sunday. The air pollution level was 190 on Friday, 137 on Thursday and 129 on November 11, as per the CPCB. The prominent pollutant here was PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 micron), PM10 (particulate matter 10 microns) and O3.BSPCB public relations officer Birendra Kumar said in a press release that the noise and air pollution level increased after 10pm on Saturday. /""The PM10 was recorded at 424 to 522 micrograms per cubic metre while PM2.5 was registered between 503 and 356 micrograms per cubic metre at different stations in the city,"" he said.The BSPCB official claimed that the overall AQI of 217 was the average of AQI level of six air monitoring stations at BIT- Mesra, Patna (264), Eco Park (334), SK Memorial Hall (286), DRM office, Khagaul (108), Planetarium (372) and Patna City (288). A ""poor"" AQI essentially means that people may suffer from breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure to such air.Board chairman Ashok Ghosh said air pollution level increases after Diwali and Chhath, as people burst crackers which contain several harmful chemicals. ""In several areas, the pollution level was in 'very poor' category, including near Planetarium and Eco Park. The increase in pollution level was mainly due to bursting of crackers. Geographical formation, climatic condition and anthropogenic are the main reasons behind the poor air quality,"" he said.""The air quality in the city, however, was still better than previous year's Diwali time. In 2019, the overall AQI level was in very poor category even ahead of Diwali,"" he said.""Vehicle emission from the outdated automobiles, dust particles in the air, open construction, burning of waste and fuel are some of the reasons behind the haze during the winter season. Most of the brick kiln owners have adopted new technology that causes less air pollution,"" Ghosh said.Pradhan Parth Sarthi, professor at Department of Environmental Science of Central University of South Bihar (CUSB), said the pollution level shot up during daytime due to calm winds leading to accumulation of pollutants. ""Improvement in the air quality depends on climatic conditions, including cloud free sky, wind velocity and high outgoing long-wave radiation,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Tehseen Poonawalla enjoys an eco-friendly Diwali,"'Bigg Boss 13' contestant Tehseen Poonawalla, who is an entrepreneur, civil rights activist, columnist and political analyst, feels the need to celebrate Diwali as a responsible citizen and minimize the use of firecrackers and plastic bags. He says, ""Bursting firecrackers causes health hazards because of the resulting air pollution from the smoke of crackers. /Pollution is a big issue of the present-day world and has many ill effects on the environment. So, all we can do is increase self-awareness and try to find more eco-friendly ways to celebrate our festivals. Also, during the Deepawali celebration, one thing that gets everyone excited about is Diwali shopping! However, shopping means a lot of plastic bags. Let's say 'no' to plastic shopping bags and use cloth bags when going out for shopping.""The reality TV star returned home to  Pune, from Delhi to celebrate the occasion with his family. He says, ""The festival of lights is celebrated with much fanfare every year at my place. It symbolises the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. A special prayer is offered to goddess Lakshmi as this ritual is believed to bring prosperity and good luck. For us the festivities essentially means the awareness of the inner light. In a way, it is the celebration of the awakening and awareness of the inner light which has the power to outshine the darkness. But this year looking at the situation and risk of Covid-19 it was a private family function. I just came back to Pune to be with my family for the celebration. We celebrated an eco-friendly Diwali."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Smoke cloud turned darker and heavier for citizens lungs this year: IITR report,"LUCKNOW: Diwali this year was more taxing for the lungs than the last year. The average air pollution levels of six localities of the city were higher in comparison to 2019, revealed the IITR Ambient Air Quality report on Monday.Headed by senior scientist GC Kisku, scientists recorded pollution levels in six localities a day before Diwali (Friday), on Diwali (Saturday) and a day after (Sunday). Every area recorded a spike in PM10 and PM2.5 levels on Diwali day.Overall, the average PM10 concentration of Lucknow this year on Diwali day was 604 micrograms, 68 units more than last year's 536.Similarly, PM2.5 level was 402 this year, 56 units more than last year's 346 micrograms. /The PM2.5 level in Gomtinagar jumped by 153 units from 500 on pre-Diwali night to 653 micrograms on Diwali night. In Charbagh, PM2.5 level was 568 micrograms, Aminabad 537 and Alambagh 452.The PM10 concentration on Diwali night in Aminabad was 913.7 micrograms, 660 units more than pre-Diwali night. In Charbagh, PM10 level on Diwali night was 814.7 micrograms, Vikasnagar 771, Gomtinagar 647, Amausi 396, Alambagh 369 and Aliganj 315.7.These findings support TOI's independent analysis of the pollution board data.However, air pollution levels this year was less than 2018 as fewer crackers were burst and wind cleared at a faster rate.

"Govt air quality data claims 'satisfactory' level, pvt figures disagree","Nagpur: The city's air quality remained dismal on Monday too, revealed data uploaded by private agencies. After remaining on the blink for two days, the government data released on Monday did not match the private agencies.On Monday, TOI had reported that government pollution control boards did not reveal the air quality data for Saturday and Sunday, the two key days when crackers were burst during the ongoing Diwali festival. However, private agencies show that the levels were ""unhealthy"" for both days.On Monday at 9pm, the air quality monitoring data uploaded on the official website of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed the city's air quality index (AQI) to be 76, which comes under 'satisfactory'.Environment activists said the figure was ""unrealistically low"", considering the temperature and large-scale bursting of crackers. /On the same day and time, the AQI displayed by private agencies was almost double that of the government figure.As per IQ Air Map, the city's AQI was 152, which is ""unhealthy"". Another website aqicn.org, said the AQI was 151, again unhealthy. ""Logically, the data by private agencies seems to be more reliable. How is it possible that despite so much bursting of crackers, the air quality remains satisfactory? What is more surprising is the fact that the discrepancy in data is at the same location in Civil Lines,"" said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of environment NGO Green Vigil Foundation.At around 4pm, the city's AQI was around 71, as per the CPCB data. ""After firecracker bursting, it only increased to 76, which is too good to be true. Such low AQI levels are usually seen in monsoon. In this season, especially during Diwali, it can't be so low,"" added Chatterjee.The restrictions on bursting firecrackers were again breached, with people bursting crackers till midnight on Monday too. Following the National Green Tribunal's diktat that non-attainment cities should not burst crackers, city police had allowed only a small window for bursting crackers between 8-10pm. However, the norm was not followed in most parts of the city.Infographics:GOING UP IN SMOKE- After being unavailable for 2 days, govt agency displayed city's AQI- Activists say data is unrealistically low- Major discrepancy between govt and private data- Private figures of air pollution double govt figures- Time restrictions on bursting crackers not followed For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
National Epilepsy Day: Anybody with severe Covid may suffer seizures for the first time,"Nagpur: Doctors say that though epilepsy patients don't face any increased risk from Covid infection, others may be at a risk of suffering from seizures for the first time in life in case of brain involvement.Neurosurgeon Dr Chandrashekhar Meshram said with severe Covid the infection risk of severe encephalitis increases but patients can rest assured as it is a treatable disease.""Patients with epilepsy do not have more chance of developing Covid infection. However, due to infection and fever, the epileptic attack may get precipitated in those with epilepsy. Those who have severe Covid infection with associated encephalitis can develop an attack of epilepsy for the first time,"" said Dr Nirmal Surya, chairman of epilepsy foundation.Dr Sangeeta Rawat, head of the neurology department at KEM Hospital, Mumbai, said epilepsy can occur at any age. ""One in 200 persons has a chance of getting epilepsy during their lifetime,"" she said.The observations come ahead of National Epilepsy Day which is on November 17. To mark the day, the Indian Academy of Neurology, Nagpur Neuro Society, Nagpur Epilepsy Association, Psychiatry Society Nagpur, Orange City Cultural Foundation, Epilepsy Foundation, Epilepsy subsection of IAN and Saptak have joined hands for a public education and awareness drive. /Well known experts from the city and across the country will speak on different aspects of the disorder.""Epilepsy is a treatable and preventable disease of the brain. There are more than 50 million patients of epilepsy all over the world and 24 lakh people are newly diagnosed every year. Nearly 80% of the people with epilepsy live in low and middle-income countries,"" said Dr Meshram, who is president of the Tropical Neurology group of the World Federation of Neurology.Neurologist at CIIMS, Dr Neeraj Baheti, said epilepsy is considered a major social stigma in many parts of our country and there are various misconceptions about epilepsy so many patients do not consult doctors. ""Family members and people with epilepsy should not hide their condition. They should consult a doctor, take regular treatment and lead a normal life"" he said.Dr Gagandeep Singh, epilepsy specialist and secretary of the Indian Academy of Neurology, cautioned that there are other conditions which look like epilepsy but in actuality that's not the case. ""If epilepsy is suspected, don't hide it and consult your doctor for a proper diagnosis. If the treatment starts early then a majority of the patients with epilepsy can be cured. It's good news that whatever medicines are available in the western world for treatment of epilepsy are also available in our country. Proper diagnosis is crucial,"" he said.IT'S A CURABLE* 70% epilepsy patients can be cured and others can be helped to lead a better life* 80% patients in low income countries are still untreated because of lack of knowledge and non-availability of medicines* India has nearly 12 million persons with epilepsy. * Main reason for recurrent epileptic attacks is not taking medicines regularly* Pay special attention during festivals and functions* By and large, Diwali is not very happy for epileptic patients as some get breakthrough seizures* Possible reasons could be air pollution, sound pollution, change in diet, excitement, lack of sleep and skipping medicinesTYPES OF SEIZURESSeizures depend on which area of the brain is involved.

Air quality index 'satisfactory' in city after 40 days,"Jaipur: The city's air quality improved drastically on Tuesday and touched the 'satisfactory' level after 40 days. The last time the city recorded such a level of ambient air quality was on October 8. The city's air quality index (AQI) value was 98 on Tuesday, down from 205 on Diwali.Earlier, doctors were apprehensive that the city's air quality might worsen after Diwali, which could have had an adverse impact on health of patients, who had recovered from Covid-19, and those who were already suffering from chronic lung diseases. /Following this, the state government had imposed a ban on crackers.But since Diwali, the air quality has been continuously improving. On Diwali (November 14), it was poor, but for the next two days it improved and has now touched the satisfactory level.A senior health department official said the advisory committee on Covid had anticipated that the rising air pollution could spread Covid cases faster. The health department officials had advised people to take precautions to avoid the risk of infection before Diwali.The ban on firecrackers, which was partially effective, helped to maintain the air quality, which did not deteriorate to the level of severe on Diwali and the next day in the city.According to health experts, the hailstorm and rain a day after the festival also helped to improve the air quality. While comparing the AQI with 2019 Diwali, the index this year was 48.4% less at police commissionerate. The AQI was 411 on Diwali in 2019, but it fell to 212 this year.

"Toxic Dhapa fumes back with start of winter, city chokes in Covid season","Kolkata: The Dhapa fumes are back as the city approaches another winter, exposing thousands of Kolkatans in the rapidly growing area off the busy EM Bypass to one of the worst types of air pollution, capable of causing severe health problems, especially in the middle of the pandemic.Stubble-burning across Punjab and Haryana, which affects the air of north India - particularly Delhi's - from the start of the winter every year is primarily from organic forms of waste. The waste at Dhapa, Kolkata's largest garbage dump, contains, apart from organic forms, vast quantities of plastics, polystyrene, rubber, polythene and similar inorganic and non-biodegradable substances which, when ignited, spew a vast amount of poisonous particulate matter into the lowest levels of the atmosphere.Inhalation of air containing such harmful chemicals can trigger chain reactions in the body. Apart from breathing distress, it could cause a wide variety of complaints: from sexual disorientation, psychological ailments to even cancer, according to Amitabha Bandyopadhyay, a professor of chemical engineering at Calcutta University, an expert.The open burning of waste was made illegal in 2016 by the National Green Tribunal, which announced a fine of Rs 25,000 per violation. The Bengal environment department subsequently issued a circular banning open waste-burning.But Dhapa's fires, say KMC sources, is self-sustained (because of the methane generated) and thus difficult to stop. /""Since the fire is self-sustained, we approached the West Bengal Pollution Control Board for a solution,"" said a senior officer of KMC's solid waste management department. ""But dousing the fires using fire-tenders is a short-term solution, since even stray embers can, and do, re-start the blaze. We need to cut off the oxygen supply, for which we are exploring long-term solutions with experts.""Geophysicist Tapas Ghatak, a former head of KMDA's environmental cell, blames our ""primitive system"" of waste disposal, which most of the world has long since abandoned. ""Experts from the Asian Development Bank, who carried a study, suggested a complete dismantling of the mountain of waste, which has crossed its saturation limit a decade ago,"" Ghatak said.""That we are still dumping assorted waste there is a terrible wrong. The world has completely shifted to segregation of waste, composting of wet degradable waste to produce high-quality manure, recycling of plastic wastes to build roads. Most metros around the world no longer generate waste as landfill. Why are we still practising this most primitive system?"" he wondered.Kalyan Rudra, the chairman of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board, said the Dhapa fumes get swept across the city, especially when the northerly winds blow into Kolkata in winter. ""Last winter, we deployed two fire-tenders to douse the flames,"" he told TOI. ""This year, I have urgently requisitioned two fire-tenders for Dhapa. Those will be deployed there shortly.""Local residents, however, said it wasn't enough. ""The real problem is that several parts of the site are inaccessible to the fire-tenders,"" said Shankar Naskar of Unchupota, a locality just off Dhapa. ""These parts generate massive amounts of smoke.""The irony is that Dhapa is a ""gold mine of methane"", says environmental activist Subhas Datta. ""This methane, if tapped properly, could be used as clean fuel for electricity. Composing can generate bio-fertilisers and plastic for road-building granules. I have been fighting legal battles to get rid of the garbage mountain since 1998, but a series of judicial orders failed to persuade the administration to do anything.""

173 Covid patients who died in last 5 months had COPD,"Madurai: As many as 173 Covid-19 patients who died between June and October in Tamil Nadu had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as one of their comorbid conditions. On 'World COPD Day' observed on Wednesday, doctors highlighted the importance of preventing and managing COPD amid the fight against Covid-19.""COPD patients are at high risk for Covid-19 compared to normal patients. More aggressive treatment may be necessary as COPD is no longer just a respiratory disease but a systemic one. /Viral or bacterial infection can cause acute exacerbation of COPD and hence treatment would be difficult in Covid-19 patients with COPD,"" said Dr P Prem Ananth, interventional pulmonologist. He added that COPD patients are also prone to developing severe forms of Covid-19. ""COPD by itself can cause respiratory failure and a patient may even need ventilation in severe cases. So, in a case where Covid-19 also needs to be treated, there is a much higher risk,"" he said.""COPD is treatable and preventable. But, we see that cases are increasing every year, mainly due to exposure to smoke and air pollution. Anyone above 40 years who is facing difficulty in breathing and anyone with persistent cough, increased sputum production and breathlessness must consult a physician for COPD check-up,"" said Dr Suganya Chandrasekaran, pulmonologist. Dr Ananth also said that smoking is a leading cause for COPD and even second-hand smoking can be deadly. Spirometry tests are recommended to be done once a year to check lung condition.Doctors also warned against stopping treatment for COPD. ""Inhalers are used to most effectively treat COPD now. They can provide immediate relief with just 1/6th of the dose given in oral tablets,"" said Dr Suganya. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
High-rises approach PCB over Dhapa waste burning,"Kolkata: Residents of at least two highrise complexes off EM Bypass have approached the pollution control board and the civic authorities pleading their intervention to prevent illegal burning of waste at Dhapa and its surrounding areas, causing air pollution and severe health problems.TOI on Wednesday highlighted how the Dhapa fumes are back as the city approaches another winter, exposing thousands of Kolkatans in the rapidly growing area off the busy EM Bypass to one of the worst types of air pollution, capable of causing severe health problems, especially in the middle of the pandemic.After the article was published, several residents living in highrises and clustered communities on and off EM Bypass and even parts of New Town and Salt Lake approached TOI speaking about the problems they have been facing because of the waste burning. ""We had written to the state PCB and local police station in September this year alerting them about the situation. Apart from stubble, several items like rubber, scrap, plastic and other waste materials are also burnt regularly, leading to toxic fumes constantly billowing in this area. /In winter, its effect is felt maximum with a pall of smog lowly hanging in the area, especially affecting residents between second to eighth floors,"" said Indranil Chowdhury, secretary, resident welfare organization, Silver Spring Complex on EM Bypass.With six active patients and around 50 others recovering from Covid-19 in Silver Spring, the smoke is especially dangerous at this point as it can easily affect the weakened lungs of the Covid survivors. Urbana resident Jayanta Guha had moved into his 16th-floor apartment at the highrise complex at Chowbaga to escape the pollution of the city and breathe in fresh air that the vast green east Kolkata wetland produces in abundance. But to his horror, he now faces the suffocating smoke and unbearable stench. An official of Bengal NRI - the developers of the posh complex said they have already approached the local civic body over the issue and now multiple residents have also been registering complaints at the police station as well as at the PCB office, seeking government intervention. Urbana has 10 active Covid-19 cases and around 90 recoveries in the last six months.The open burning of waste was made illegal in 2016 by the National Green Tribunal, which announced a fine of Rs 25,000 per violation. The Bengal environment department subsequently issued a circular banning open waste-burning.But according to Kolkata Municipal Corporation sources, Dhapa's fires are self-sustained because of the methane generated and thus are difficult to stop. ""Fire tenders are deployed at Dhapa on a daily basis every year but dousing the fires using fire-tenders is a short-term solution. We need to cut off the oxygen supply, for which we are exploring long-term solutions,"" said a KMC official. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
MP's air quality improves 5 days after Diwali,"Bhopal: The air quality in major cities of Madhya Pradesh improved significantly five days after Diwali. The air pollution levels improved 100 points reaching satisfactory to moderate levels in Bhopal, Indore and Jabalpur. The air quality improved 100 points in Gwalior too but still remained in the poor category, said the Central Pollution Control Board. /Analysis of the air pollution of major MP cities points that the air quality was best in June during Unlock 1, which kept deteriorating with every other Unlock, peaking on Diwali. The air quality in MP cities had deteriorated significantly this Diwali. Air quality of major MP cities Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior and Jabalpur a day after Diwali was not even fit for breathing. The Air Quality Index (AQI) on Sunday (a day after Diwali) in Bhopal, Indore and Jabalpur was recorded at 'Poor' which means breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. The air quality of Gwalior was 'Very Poor' similar to New Delhi which may lead to respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. Air Quality Index between 0 and 50 is termed as good with minimal possible health impacts, Air Quality Index between 51 and 100 is satisfactory but may lead to minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people, above 100 is moderate and leads to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. AQI above 200 leads to breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure and AQI above 300 may cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure, as per the pollution control board.Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage, among others.PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Central Pollution Control Board data points that air quality of major MP cities improved majorly in lockdown. Officials said lockdown helped in cutting down air pollution to unexpected levels. But the cities were unable to maintain the low air pollution level after the unlocks. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
NGT: Ensure remedial action in 2 months,"Shimla: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the secretary, urban development department to ensure remedial action in two months and file a compliance report on the issue of violation of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 at Dughneri village of Hamirpur district.The order has been issued on a petition filed by Rita Sharma and a few others who stated that due to failure to handle waste, it is being burnt, causing air pollution beside resulting in diseases, loss of livestock and forest fires. Petitioners alleged that the waste has led to increase in the population of monkeys, feral dogs and scavengers like crows and vultures, etc. The dump site is overflowing and contaminating the water body, which is a source of irrigation, they said. /The applicant also produced relevant photographs and letters.The Tribunal, on January 14, sought a report from the deputy commissioner, Hamirpur, municipal council, Hamirpur and Himachal Pradesh State Pollution Control Board.The joint inspection report filed by the state pollution control board before the Tribunal on November 13 stated that the joint inspection committee (JIC) had directed the MC to join the corners of the RCC retaining wall with the hill side to avoid spillage of solid waste and provide proper fencing to prevent entry of stray animals inside the facility.

Lung cancer awareness month: Is pollution responsible for Lung Cancer?,"The National Capital has once again slipped into the 'very poor air quality' category and with anti-pollution measures being taken to bring down the severity, the exposure to pollutants is still a major risk factor for developing lung cancer. Air pollution levels can put a healthy human being at a huge risk in terms of pulmonary health.Dr Chandragouda D, Director and HOD medical Oncology, Akash Hospital, Delhi says ""Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world and the vast majority is caused by tobacco smoking but even in the absence of the habit of smoking, present air quality in Delhi is equivalent to inhaling the smoke of at least 30 cigarettes a day. So, environmental causes of cancer, including air pollution, has become a major concern too.""Dr. Chandra further said that high levels of air pollution triggers the development of diseases like Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and Acute bronchitis; more than 10 million cases has been reported per year in India and are increasing at an alarming rate among non-smokers as well. /COPD is the collective term for a group of conditions that damage tissues in the lungs and airways and this damage affects airflow in and out of the lungs, making breathing difficult.Lung cancer is a serious and potentially deadly disease that affects a person's ability to breath. With quality of air being compromised both indoors and outdoors, it has a direct impact on the health of children, expecting mothers, and senior citizens as their immune system is fragile. In case one experiences long stretches of wheezing along with trouble breathing. and feel persistent cough, chest pain and shortness of breath, consult with a doctor immediately as they can provide a more accurate diagnosis, considering the condition. Prevention is always better than cure, so taking few steps and bringing some lifestyle changes will be helpful to lead a better health.-Reduce indoor pollution by not using incense sticks or agarbattis-Quit smoking-Wear an N95 grade mask while stepping outdoors-Switch to a healthy diet to strengthen your immune system-Keep the nasal passage clean with steam and practice regular breathing exercise-Check the air quality before stepping out and step out only when its necessary Above all, the Covid-19 pandemic has created more challenge for cancer patients as they are already immune compromised. The coronavirus primarily attacks the lungs and the respiratory tracts. So, anything that harms the lungs can and result in more severe effects if people get infected. So as a society also, we must take necessary steps and adhere to government guidelines to help reduce pollution and risk of the virus at the same time. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Two fire-tenders start dousing Dhapa flames,"Kolkata: Two fire-tenders started dousing flames at Dhapa landfill site on Wednesday. The self-sustained fire at the landfill site, fuelled by a reserve methane produced from the municipal waste, is one of the major sources of air pollution on the eastern fringes of the city. West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) pressed into service the fire-tenders and firefighters in PPE kits were found dousing multiple sources of fire at the site. /They will work for 24X7 there.""We have been very concerned about controlling the fire at Dhapa. We have requisitioned four fire-tenders - two for Dhapa and the rest for Pramod Nagar landfill sites. The fire tenders will carry out the job till March. After that, meteorological conditions will facilitate dispersal of the smoke in the upper atmosphere,"" said WBPCB chairman, Kalyan Rudra.Besides, WBPCB officials have been keeping a surveillance on the Dhapa site so that no fire incident happens there. However, dousing the flames with fire-tenders is a short-term measure. ""Eventually, we will have to cut the supply of methane to the flames. We have some options like extracting methane, bio-mining the waste. The cost efficient and environment-friendly measure will be adopted,"" said an official of WBPCB. Unlike the burning of stubble across Punjab and Haryana, which spikes Delhi's pollution, noxious fume of Dhapa - one of the major sources of pollution in the eastern part of the city - is the dirtiest, thanks to constant burning of assorted garbage, including a large quantity of plastics, thermocol, rubber, polythene, heavy metals, paints, adhesives and kitchen wastes. Inhaling the air containing such harmful chemicals can trigger chain reactions in the body. The outcomes of such chain reactions are dangerous. A long list of diseases, including sexual disorientation, psychological ailments or cancer can be attributed to exposure of such pollution, said Amitabha Bandyopadhyay, an expert on the chemical reactions in the body due to waste burning and a professor of chemical engineering at CU.

"Thanks to Delhi's pollution, cases of younger people having respiratory illnesses have gone up: Doctors","It's no longer people with family history of respiratory illnesses or the older people, but cases of asthma and other breathing problems have gone up among under-30s due to pollutionThe worsening air quality and rising levels of pollutants in Delhi's air each year have given rise to increasing cases of respiratory illnesses and disorders in the capital. Doctors say they are seeing more patients with asthma and respiratory illnesses, mostly caused due to pollution. But while it is believed that the most vulnerable to the effects of pollution are the very young and old, data released by a healthcare service provider paints a different picture. According to the Practo Health Insights for October-November 2020, out of all queries on the Practo app and website related to respiratory and pulmonary health concerns, the maximum (34%) were from the age group of 21-30.Not more susceptible, but Youngsters more exposed to air pollution as they go out of the house frequently, say DoctorsHealthcare professionals maintain that high reporting does not mean that young people are necessarily more susceptible to respiratory illnesses, it could be caused by the fact that the younger generation is exposed to pollution more. /Dr Richa Sareen, Consultant, Pulmonology and Critical Care Medicine, Fortis Hospital Vasant Kunj, tells us, ""All are equally susceptible to the effects of air pollution and weather change, including the youth. People who have underlying asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or predilection to allergies are more prone to develop respiratory issues at this time. Youngsters are also more exposed to air pollution, as they go out of the house more often than others. Furthermore, they are also more prone to tobacco smoke exposure which worsens their symptoms.""Doctors add that there is a definite rise in cases of diseases like asthma in people under 30, which can be directly linked to pollution. ""We have seen younger asthmatic patients are coming more in numbers, this is again because of the pollution. And now it is getting worse because the pollution level is becoming so high and the severity of the symptoms has really increased,"" says Dr Sandeep Nayar, Senior Director and Head, Centre for Chest and Respiratory Disease, BLK Super Speciality Hospital.Have to travel with an inhaler now: Young DelhiitesThere are many 20-somethings across NCR who share this common story of developing breathing issues and respiratory illnesses over the last few years. Twenty-nine-year-old consultant Richa Shah tells us, ""I have to travel with an inhaler now, particularly in the winter months, because I have allergic asthma. As soon as it gets polluted, I can't breathe and develop a bad cold and cough."" Thirty-year-old Dwarka resident Mohammad Saif adds, ""I used to be an athlete in college, so this is a big letdown for me. I used to be one of the fittest in the room and now I can't even climb a flight of stairs if I am on the phone. It's a myth that pollution can affect you only if you are old or already prone to respiratory illnesses. I was in a marketing job and hence, had to be outdoors eight-10 hours a day. That is what caused my exposure.""What is alarming is that many of these patients have no family history of respiratory illnesses and are otherwise 'fit and healthy'. Rachit Arora, a 27-year-old IT professional from Rohini, says, ""I have had no history of any illness and my family has none either. So, when I started having difficulty in breathing last year, I assumed it was because of the cold I had. But it just did not go away, after which I was diagnosed with bronchial asthma. At 27, I am not supposed to be worried about my breathing.""And the double whammy is that due to an existing respiratory condition, they now have to be extra careful about a risk of COVID-19 infection as studies have shown that the coronavirus can be especially harmful to those with existing pulmonary and respiratory diseases. Ankita, a 25-year-old from Gurgaon who has had pollution-related breathing issues since she moved to NCR two years ago, says, ""My friend is the same age as me and he has asthma. He contracted COVID two months ago and it was hell for him. He barely made it out alive. That scares me because I already have weak lungs. How will I manage COVID, which attacks your lungs?""- With inputs from Riya Sharma For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Poor air quality may hinder fight against coronavirus: Doctors,"PATNA: With studies linking air pollution to more Covid-19 cases and deaths, health experts have advised Patnaites to remain cautious, wear face masks and follow social distancing norms.While the city's air quality has slipped from the 'poor' to 'very poor' category, its night temperature hovers in the range of 10-12 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature in Patna was 11.2 degrees C on Thursday and the air quality index stood at 319, which falls in the 'very poor' category.Dr Maria Neira of the World Health Organisation states that exposure to air pollution increases the risk of respiratory diseases. Besides, a study titled 'Regional and Global Contributions of Air Pollution to Risk of Death from Covid-19', which was published in 'Cardiovascular Research' of the European Society of Cardiology in October, points out that about 15% of deaths worldwide from Covid-19 may be linked to long-term exposure to air pollution.City doctors claim that particulate matter can remain suspended in the atmosphere for a longer time due to low temperature and deteriorating air quality, increasing the transmissibility of coronavirus.According to Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, nodal officer for Covid-19 at the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, pollution affects the respiratory system and lowers immunity. /""If your lungs are already weak due to pollution, the chances of contracting Covid-19 are higher. Hence, the usage of face masks is compulsory,"" he told this newspaper.Dr Ashish Karn of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences also said a surge in the level of pollution would lead to a fall in the Covid recovery rate.""Polluted air can enter the lungs and cause severe damage, increasing the risk of chronic respiratory diseases. Such people are likely to develop severe illnesses if they contract Covid-19,"" he added.Indian Medical Association (Bihar) senior vice-president Dr Ajay Kumar pointed out that air pollution directly affected the lungs and the respiratory system, making the immune system weak. He said, ""People should follow the safety measures strictly and maintain physical distancing. They should also avoid crowded events and not step out of their houses unless it is necessary.""

Air quality worsens across MP after Gyaras fireworks,"BHOPAL: Fireworks on Dev Uthani Gyaras on Wednesday night again increased the pollution levels of cities in Madhya Pradesh on Thursday.The air quality index (AQI) that measures air pollution went up to 50 points in Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior and Jabalpur in a gap of 24 hours between Wednesday and Thursday.Air pollution was more in Gwalior and Jabalpur in comparison to Bhopal and Indore. Pollution levels of Jabalpur and Gwalior were close to what it was a day after Diwali. On the day after Diwali, when pollution is at the peak due to fireworks in the night a day earlier, the AQI ranged between 200 and 250 in Bhopal, Indore and Jabalpur while the AQI of Gwalior was above 300. It came down a few days after Diwali, but again went up on Dev Uthani Gyaras.Air quality index of Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior and Jabalpur during Unlock 1 on June 25 - after lockdown due to corona - ranged between 50 and 75, which means it was the best.Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. /While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage, among others.PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads, while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases.CPCB data points out that air quality of major MP cities improved majorly in the lockdown. Officials said though it is debatable whether lockdown helped in controlling corona or not, but it definitely helped in cutting down air pollution to unexpected levels. But the cities were unable to maintain the low air pollution level after Unlock.The air pollution peaked during Diwali. It came down after Diwali, but remains high when compared to the air quality after the lockdown in major MP cities. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Gurugram: Covid symptoms worse in third wave, say doctors","GURUGRAM: As the number of Covid-19 cases keep rising in the city, the symptoms with which patients visit hospitals are also aggravating.Doctors at many hospitals pointed out that in the city's third Covid wave, they are witnessing worse respiratory problems, and patients are coming in with severe breathlessness and decreased oxygen saturation compared to the earlier waves. Also, there is a rise in pneumonia cases that is causing oxygen deficiency leading to breathing difficulty, chest congestion and tightness.Dr Sanjay Gupta, deputy medical superintendent (DMS) and senior consultant, internal medicine, Medeor Hospital in Manesar, said: ""In this third wave, we are noticing a rise in the mortality rate amongst the patients coming in our hospital. This is primarily because of patients developing severe pneumonia (ARDS) in about 75%-80% cases, up from 50%-60% patients earlier. /Also, we are noticing that patients are responding less to treatments that were used earlier.""Till November 8, the city's hospitals saw 690 Covid patients - a number that rose by 20% in the next 19 days, as on November 27 the figure stood at 830.""In the third Covid wave, morbidity and mortality arising out of pulmonary complications like severe pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome have been severe, requiring a larger number of ICU beds with oxygen support as well as ventilator support, typically affecting the elderly, diabetics, those with pre-existing heart disease or immune-compromised persons,"" said Dr Amitabh Parti, director, Internal Medicine, Fortis Hospital.Why is the third wave critical? According to Dr Manjeeta Nath Das, a consultant (internal medicine) at Columbia Asia Hospital, ""The factors that make the third wave different are the following: firstly, this wave is more widespread and intense in community spread. People have become careless and frustrated, and so, we are seeing more people getting affected than before. The falling temperature and increasing air pollution may be factors as well, but they are subject to further study. Also, this time, more patients are needing oxygen and ventilator support than the previous two waves. Thirdly, the fear of the pandemic is gone and people have started taking it as a common cold since 80% of the recoveries are happening without or minimal treatment. However, 20% of the patients get severely ill and sick, and a part of them account for the fatal cases as well.""Apart from other factors, the concerning issue is that the rate of transmission is faster at present circumstances. Dr P Venkata Krishnan, senior consultant, internal medicines, Paras Hospital, said ""Third wave is significant as the transmission is faster because of the cold. The criticality has increased because of pollution.""Doctors said that patients who need rehabilitation due to post-Covid symptoms have increased. They are coming to hospitals with complaints of fatigue, mild shortness of breath, muscle pains and mild nausea persisting for as long as 6-8 weeks. ""It must be emphasised that breathing exercises, steam inhalation, physical activity and good nutrition remain the mainstay of convalescence,""said Dr Parti. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Toxic air leaves toddlers gasping for breath,"Gurgaon: With the national capital region witnessing early winter and high levels of pollution this season, November saw a rise in respiratory problems in babies, doctors at several hospitals have said. Allergic reactions, common cough and cold as well as pneumonia and congestion in the lungs are the most common ailments the litle ones are being diagnosed with. About 70% of the babies coming to hospitals have breathing issues while 40% are suffering from bronchiolitis, a type of lung infection, doctors estimate. /Most of the babies admitted to hospitals during this period are aged between six and 36 months (3 years). Thus, parents are advised to take necessary precautions.Dr Rohit Arora, head of neonatology & pediatric, Miracles Mediclinic & Apollo Cradle Hospital, Gurgaon, said, ""Rising air pollution leads to increased irritation and inflammation in the lungs and precipitates infection. Earlier, such instances were confined to kids exposed to indoor pollution where chulhas and smoking was common but now it's everywhere thanks to the polluted air that has affected the community as a whole. Neonates are experiencing nasal block and are requiring observation/ admissions in neonatal intensive care.""He added that pregnant women also need to limit their time outside when the air quality is bad. ""Now, that winter has also come, we can clearly see a spike in cases of pneumonia among children. The first signs of pneumonia are flu-like symptoms such as high fever, cold and cough. It is important to give your child fluids frequently to prevent dehydration. Offer small sips of water and breastfeeds to infants more often,"" the doctor said.Doctors added that admission of Paediatric intensive care units (PICU) has seen a rise by 12% this month, which is a major concern. ""After Dussehra, PICU admissions have increased by 12%, with most of them suffering from breathing issues, allergic reactions, common cough and cold as well as pneumonia and congestion in lungs. About 70% of babies have breathing issues while 40% are suffering from bronchiolitis. According to a study, a mother's exposure to pollution may increase inflammation in her body and impair blood flow through vessels. This can particularly affect the placenta, which supplies oxygen and nutrients to the developing foetus,"" said Dr Sudip Chowdhury, pediatrician at Columbia Asia Hospital, Gurgaon.This is important to note that according to UNICEF a child dies of pneumonia every 39 seconds and around 50% of these deaths are associated with air pollution. Experts added that exposure to air pollution can alter children's trajectory through life, pushing them onto a path of suffering, illness and challenge.""Detailed investigations of the cases presented in the past few weeks in the NCR region suggest that not only viral and bacterial but also fungal infections are being precipitated by the hazardous levels of air pollution. Health effects experienced early in life increase a child's future risk of disease and can lead to lifelong consequences,"" said Dr Krishan Chugh, director and HOD, Paediatrics, Fortis Hospital, Gurgaon.

Mumbai's air quality deteriorates; ensure your mask fights COVID-19 and pollution,"The last few months during the lockdown saw the air quality index (AQI) in Mumbai being satisfactory, but recent reports give us a reality-check. The new findings show that the AQI has now reached over 200, which is said to be worrisome amid the pandemic. While wearing masks is part of the new normal, it has now become imperative to wear one at all times with the air quality in the city also deteriorating. It is important to protect those lungs from the virus as well as the bad air. /So what kind of masks should we turn to at a time like this? Experts weigh in...Wear a proper mask while stepping out amid pandemic and air pollution: DoctorsDr Arvind Kate, pulmonologist at Zen Multispecialty Hospital, Chembur, says, ""Poor air quality and air pollution are taking a toll on Mumbaikars. Changing climatic conditions are also adding to the problem. It's wise to wear a proper mask while stepping out amid pandemic and air pollution. The ideal ones are N99 and N100 masks that filter PM 2.5 like pollutants with around 99-99.97 per cent accuracy. These masks filter the dust particles and air pollutants in an effective manner. They come with good face coverage and in turn, will prevent you from inhaling pollutants. Use medically-approved masks that are of superior quality. N95 masks without a valve are also available, which can be used to filter small and large particles. It also fits the face properly and aids proper breathing. However, a triple-layer cloth mask is also good enough for people not exposed to a hospital environment.""Dr Harish Chafle, consultant intensivist and chest physician, Global Hospital, Mumbai, says, ""Mumbai's air quality has deteriorated and harmful gases and particulate matter have been noticed even above permissible limits. A good quality anti-pollution mask will minimise your exposure to pollutants and reduce its impact on your lung health. Look for N, R, and P-type masks to keep particulate matter (PM) at bay. Sports masks can also be used when you are stuck in heavy Mumbai traffic. Avoid using disposable or surgical masks that have thin layers and do not provide protection. One should not use regular masks while exercising or cycling. In fact, using a regular mask while exercising can make breathing difficult and it can get damp from inside with sweat, making it unsuitable for use.""Dr Sonam Solanki, pulmonologist, Wockhardt Hospital, South Bombay adds, ""A nano-filtered face mask can allow one to breathe freely and cover the whole face, while restricting the dust particles from entering your nose or mouth. Breathing in air pollutants can irritate your airways and may cause shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, asthma episodes and chest pain. Exposure to air pollution puts you at risk for lung cancer, heart attacks, stroke and in extreme cases, premature death.""Mumbaikars are not cautious about the mask they use: PharmacistWhile experts stress on the importance of wearing the right mask, Mumbai residents seem oblivious to it. Says Ravi Kumar from a pharmacy in the central suburbs, ""People never ask for specific masks, they are more concerned about the aesthetics and the style of the mask than the protection it can offer them. They aren't cautious or conscious about the type of mask they are buying, but wear them for the sake of it and to avoid being penalised by the police.""People exposed to poor air might fare worse if infected with COVID-19, say expertsMedical experts like Dr Arvind Kate caution that rising air pollution during the pandemic can worsen lung health. He explains, ""The small particles and pollutants tend to create irritation and obstruction in the respiratory tract. This can lead to bronchitis, a condition that involves recurrent episodes of coughing and breathlessness. It can also cause recurrent sneezing and watering of eyes. The rising pollution levels will make things worse for asthmatics and patients with long-standing respiratory illness.""Aaron Bernstein, interim director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, summed up the situation when he reportedly said, ""Given what we know now, it is very likely that people who are exposed to more air pollution and who are smoking tobacco products are going to fare worse if infected with COVID-19 than those who are breathing cleaner air, and who don't smoke.""Things to remember while buying a mask to fight the virus and pollutionLook for N, R, and P-type masks to keep particulate matter (PM) at bayWear masks with nanotech filter or N95 masks without valveN99 masks that come with many layers can be used in MumbaiMask must have viral filtration efficiency (VFE) and particulate filtration efficiency (PFE)Ensure the mask seals your faceCloth mask made from a t-shirt or thin material may not be usefulMasks used for long duration and for days are also not protectiveAvoid wearing a bandana, scarf or handkerchief as a maskSurgical masks and normal cloth face coverings are not effective against air pollution For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
45 hospitalised as mystery disease strikes parts of Eluru in Andhra Pradesh,"ELURU: Health and medical experts in West Godavari district were on tenterhooks on Saturday as a group of people from different parts of Eluru town were hospitalised with symptoms resembling epilepsy. In all, 45 people have been hospitalised. What has baffled doctors attending them is that the patients are not related and belong to different areas of Eluru. /They did not even participate or attend a common event.A medical expert team will visit Eluru and inspect the cases on Sunday to diagnose the problem. It is suspected that they may have been exposed to water or air pollution. Officials also do not rule out a mysterious disease.Blood samples have been collected for analysis to pinpoint the cause of seizures, which are accompanied by frothing and temporary loss of consciousness. The patients are of different age groups. A six-year-old girl was shifted to Vijayawada after her condition worsened. An emergency medicare centre has been set up in Vijayawada as a precautionary measure.All the patients have been admitted to Eluru government hospital. They belong to Kothapeta, Padamara Veedhi and Vangaya Gudem areas of the town. Health minister Alla Nani also visited the hospital and interacted with the patients.He also directed the district medical and health officer to conduct a door-to-door survey of the affected areas and keep emergency medicines available. Special medical camps will be set up in the town, he said, adding that health teams will inspect the area and check whether contaminated food or water was consumed by the affected people.District medical and health officer K Sunanda said all patients presented with symptoms like falling down suddenly, frothing, and shivering. Stating that the affected people recover all of sudden and again present themselves with the symptoms, she said there is no threat to any of the affected patients.

"Dec sees first 'severe' day, no respite today","New Delhi: Delhi recorded its first 'severe' air day of the month with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of 404 on Saturday, according to Central Pollution Control Board's daily bulletin. While the impact of stubble burning was classified as 'negligible' by agencies, unfavourable meteorological conditions like low wind speed and low temperatures led to a spike in air pollution over the last 48 hours, trapping emissions locally.Delhi also recorded shallow fog on Saturday morning with the visibility dropping to 600 metres.The city had recorded an AQI of 382 (very poor) on Friday and an AQI of 341 (very poor) on Thursday. The capital is currently receiving easterly winds, which bring more moisture to the region.Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at India Meteorological Department and head of the regional weather forecasting centre in Delhi, said the capital might see an improvement in air quality from Monday. /""Wind speeds are expected to increase as the wind direction changes and air quality may improve again. Wind speed on Saturday was around 5-6 km/hr, which did not allow dispersion. Shallow fog was recorded in the early hours with the pollutants mixing with the moisture to create a slight haze,"" Srivastava added.""The overall air quality is in the higher end of 'very poor' as forecast. Surface-level winds are moderate and east-northeasterly in direction. The boundary layer wind direction is southerly and not favourable for stubble fire-related transport. Stubble fire counts from SAFAR-multi-satellite products are still around 296 but its % share in Delhi's PM2.5 is negligible,"" stated System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting Research on Saturday, adding that AQI was only expected to improve on Monday and Tuesday, owing to better ventilation.Delhi had recorded nine 'severe' air days this November, the highest in the last four years. The highest AQI recorded in November was 477, largely influenced by a combination of meteorological factors and stubble burning.The capital recorded a minimum temperature of 11 degrees Celsius on Saturday - two notches above normal. The region has been recording sub-par temperature for the better part of two months now with the capital recording its coldest November in 71 years this year and also its coldest October in the last 58 years.IMD officials said mercury would again drop to around 9 degrees Celsius by December 11. ""Cold north-westerly winds come from the mountains and generally lead to a drop in temperature. This is what led to such low temperatures until last week,"" said a Met official.

Is Mumbai's Covid curve under control? Positivity rate down to key 5% mark,"MUMBAI: The decline in Mumbai's Covid graph was clearly evident on Saturday as the 'coronavirus test positivity rate' that was at times as high as 32% during the early phase of the pandemic dipped to 5%.Only 825 out of the 16,394 people tested on Friday were positive, according to a statement released by BMC commissioner I S Chahal early on Saturday. ""The Covid test positivity for the last 10 days looks promising, but we should not be complacent and should not lower our guard,"" said the commissioner. Public health experts have warned that cases could increase slightly by December-end, when temperatures drop and air pollution levels increase in Mumbai.The World Health Organisation has maintained that a positivity rate of 5% is significant in order to get the Covid curve under control.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force on Covid-19, said, ""Mumbai had been struggling with Covid-19. It had a high tally of cases as well as a high death rate. /But in the last month, the cases have been steadily declining. It has at last caught up with the magic number of 5%. It can now be said that Covid is officially on the decline in Mumbai.""The BMC statement on Saturday said the test positivity rate was 6.69% on November 25, when one of the highest numbers of daily tests -- 19,018 - were done and 1,272 tested positive.The rate increased to 6.84% on November 29, when 721 out of 10,538 tested positive.The positivity rate has been under 6% since December 1, declining steadily every day to 5.03% on December 4.However, a closer look at the testing numbers on December 4 showed that positivity rate for RT-PCR tests in government hospitals was still high at 31%: 54 out of 173 tested here were positive. In the private sector, which had done the bulk of the RT-PCR tests at 8,155, the positivity was 7%, with 603 patients. In BMC-run RT-PCR tests, only 27 out of 539 (5%) tested positive. BMC did more of antigen tests - 7,155 - on Friday, with only 113 or 2% testing positive.""In the initial days, when our testing capacity was low and we had a limited number of kits, we would only test symptomatic patients and on a few days we got a positivity rate of 36%,"" said a senior BMC doctor. Even now, the doctor said, the positivity rate among patients who get tested at hospitals is higher than the overall rate.At the national level, the daily positivity rate has been below 5% for a couple of weeks now. Around 10 lakh tests were being done on an average every day across the country, and positivity rate has been between 4.3% and 5%.""With a continuous surge in daily cases in European and the American countries, India is taking all cautionary steps to bring the trajectory of the disease under control. In view of the increase in Covid cases of some of the north Indian States, the Centre has advised all states and UTs to ramp up testing,"" said the health ministry statement.

"The multiplier impact of pollution, winter on influenza and COVID-19","With unlock India coming into picture, several cities are bearing the brunt of toxic air quality. Among the top cities battling poor air quality, Delhi is topping the charts with Air Quality Index as its almost touching between 400-500 in November owing to multiple reason including paddy stubble burning, Diwali and other various festivities. India being a tropical country, has observed a steady growth in the number of influenza cases since 2009 in both winter and monsoon seasons. /To add to that, pollution has been a silent risk factor for worsening respiratory illnesses including allergies, asthma along with influenza and Covid-19. Winter, air pollution and seasonal influenza together pose a grave threat to cities like Delhi amid the on-going pandemic.As India braces itself for the unexpected by shoring up its healthcare infrastructure, it is important to ensure that the public healthcare system is not burdened by the onslaught of other seasonal diseases. With an additional risk of co-infection between COVID-19 and Influenza, the combination can be disastrous. Fortunately, influenza - one of the common respiratory diseases - can be taken care of its severe form of morbidity and mortality through vaccination.High-risk groups such as pregnant women, elderly and children below the age of five and individuals with comorbidities like diabetes, respiratory ailments like Asthma and COPD should be administered with the latest recommended strain of influenza vaccine, every year. In Delhi, with the recent decision of re-opening schools for higher classes -10th-12th these children should also be protected against the known amid the unknown.The best time to administer a flu vaccine is October to December and April to June. However, in tropical countries like India, vaccination can be administered at any time. Influenza vaccines have been shown to reduce the related illnesses and the risk of serious complications by up to 60%.It is important to administer Influenza vaccine to entire family, including adults and children, and take necessary steps to take care of holistic health & development. Following healthy lifestyle, diet and exercise, especially respiratory exercises can help maintain immunity and wellbeing. As individuals, we must make the most of available healthcare solutions to keep our health in check in order to keep the economy going!Vaccines help the immune system to develop a protective shield against diseases.

Power plant emission in suburbs turns city air toxic,"Kolkata: Smog persisted for the fourth consecutive day in the city with a thick blanket of haze hanging low till late morning, reducing visibility and disrupting transport services - road, water and air. The city air quality index improved a shade on Friday with AQI swerving from very poor (301-400) to poor (201-300). Health experts have advised against any strenuous outdoor physical activities, particularly for people above 50.""Recent research evidence has also shown that as the state begins to feel a nip in the air, the city experiences high sulphur dioxide (SO2) concentrations, which in most cases are not locally generated but carried by the complex wind dynamics that dominate the Indian landmass,"" said a report titled 'State of Bengal's Air' by SwitchON Foundation and Bengal Clean Air Network (Bengal CAN).Due to the calm conditions, pollutants are persisting at the lower levels of the atmosphere. ""This calls for action for controlling secondary particulate matter pollution in Kolkata,"" said the report. /A CSE study has indicated that the local ambient SO2 concentration in Kolkata is quite low. The sudden increase in PM2.5 across Kolkata is largely due to emission from power plants and industries in the suburbs. In fact, Urban Emissions Info, which provides insight into air pollution in urban agglomerations to support public dialogue and policy discussions, indicates that this particular smog episode in Kolkata is influenced by power plant emissions and domestic use of solid fuel.On Friday, smog kept the sun hidden from view till after 10am that left the city cold and grey till noon. Meteorological conditions changed ever so slightly thereafter. The absolute calm that persisted for the last three days was broken by some vertical wind movement, dispersing some pollutants. ""The smog contains a very high concentration of finer particulate matter like PM2.5, which are ultrafine particles of diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. They can easily travel straight into the bloodstream,"" PCB scientists have warned.Weathermen said the fog could persist till the weekend since moisture - one of the factors that contribute to its formation - was still flowing into Kolkata. ""There's a high-pressure zone above Bay of Bengal that is supplying moisture. Since the wind speed is very low, the moisture is easily crystalizing into fog,"" said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Contaminated food may have caused Eluru mystery illness: Reports,"AMARAVATI: Reports of various research institutions indicate food contamination, while ruling out water or air pollution, as the possible cause for the 'mystery' disease in Eluru that has left over 600 people hospitalised since December 6.While the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) found mercury residues in rice and pesticides on tomatoes, the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology suspected that pesticides may have triggered the acute symptoms. All research bodies said they need more time to zero in on the exact cause. How lead and nickel, which were not present in water, entered the human body remained a puzzle. They said that they have also found abnormal level of organo phosphorus in the blood samples of the victims. NIN scientists said that high usage of pesticides in the region might have been the reason for the illness. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Patient count up by 90% as PM2.5 level rises 13 times since lockdown,"Kolkata: The number of patients with breathing distress jumped by 60%-90% at city hospitals since the unlocking started. These cases had dropped to an all-time low during the lockdown months, when the city's air quality was at its best. On Saturday, health experts linked all major ailments with deteriorating air quality in no uncertain terms at a webinar organised by the Bengal Clean Air Network (Bengal CAN) and SwitchON Foundation.Significantly, the average level of PM2.5 jumped 13 times from the cleanest week of August to the most polluted weeks of December in Kolkata. /In Howrah, it rose 11 times. Winter air turned dramatically toxic as the share of PM2.5 increased substantially. Senior pulmonologist Arup Haldar found a 90% spike in the number of patients with breathing distress compared to June-July-August in the outpatient department of private hospitals. Same is the opinion of Kautabh Chowdhuy, a paediatrician. According to Sanjukta Dutta, an emergency medicine expert, there was an increase of at least 60% in the number of patients compared to those during the clean air days.""Patients with asthma, COPD, upper-respiratory tract infection, allergic bronchitis and unexplained cough are queueing up in OPD everyday. They said they were so well during the lockdown that they thought they were cured of the disease and even stopped medication,"" said Haldar of Woodlands Hospital.""We initially thought that many patients were not coming to hospitals fearing Covid-19. But breathing distress and other ailments triggered by air pollution are such that they often need an emergency support system, which they cannot get at home. The lockdown is an example of how clean air can accelerate healing and allow us to live healthily,"" said Dutta.Suman Mallik, a radiation oncologist with Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, said the increase in the number of non-smokers falling prey to head and neck and lung cancer clearly shows the dangerous role of air pollution. Oncologist MV Chandrakanth added that the spectrum of malignancy vastly changes in cancer patients depending on the air quality of the area where they reside.As per the survey conducted by Bengal CAN and SwitchON Foundation, 95% doctors perceived that the current air pollution status of the city and state was a health emergency. Around 37% believe the air quality in the state has shown no improvement over the last couple of years. Around 10% believe that it had turned for the worse. The impact of air pollution, according to the doctors surveyed, are is worse among newborns and senior citizens.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Navi Mumbai breathes polluted air for most of the day: Study,"MUMBAI: Residents living in Kharghar-Taloja-Panvel breathe polluted air for most part of the day, found a month-long air-monitoring exercise by environment NGO Waatavaran Foundation. Five low-cost real-time monitors installed in the city found that the average PM2.5 (particulate matter lesser than 2.5 microns) over a 31-day period was nearly two times the Indian safe limits for the pollutants.The average PM 2.5 concentration for the five locations - MIDC and Navade in Taloja, Sector 13 in Panvel, Sector 36 and 7 in Kharghar, was 101.1 g/m3 (microgrammes per cubic metre) which is 1.7 times the Indian safe limit of (60 g/m3) and four times the WHO standard (25 g/m3). Of the five locations, the most polluted was MIDC, Taloja with a PM 2.5 concentration of 139.27 g/m3 during November 13 to December 13. ""The data has helped identify some useful trends of air quality in and around MIDC, Taloja. The daily data shows poor air quality that is much above the Indian Air Quality safe level. /Real-time monitoring of air quality with scientifically validated technology helps provide citizens with timely information which impacts their health and well-being,"" said Ronak Sutaria, Founder and Director Mumbai based air quality researchers Respirer Living Sciences. The company's monitors were used for the study.The study also revealed that the highest PM2.5 levels of 141.1 g/m3 were recorded at 7 am and levels were above permissible limits for 17 hours in a day. ""The pollutants can cause several health problems, including recurrent lung infections, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart ailments and stroke in the elderly. It is now up to the local authorities to take this issue seriously and plan strategies to reduce the levels of air pollution in Panvel using sustainable means,"" said Dr Sundeep Salvi, director, Pulmocare Research and Education (PURE) Foundation, Pune.The NGO will submit its report to the local and state authorities and demand Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations in Panvel. Bhagwan Kesbhat, Founder of Waatavaran Foundation and a resident of Kharghar said, ""The key reasons for initiating this first of its kind study in this area was to not only understand the air quality that people from the Kharghar-Panvel-Taloja were daily breathing, but to also highlight the fact that the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and the civic body have failed to provide real-time air quality monitoring system.""

Dry waste fire causes pollution in Lake,"Kolkata: Dry green waste, including grass, weeds and worn out tree branches, dumped on the sides of Rabindra Sarobar stadium, are often set on fire, causing severe air pollution and distress to local residents. Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA), the custodian of Rabindra Sarobar, has started deploying some of their security guards from Monday to prevent the nuisance. On Sunday night, some of the dry waste that had accumulated beside the auditorium went set alight and the entire area was engulfed by smoke. The KMDA authorities had to call in a fire tender to douse the same.""We have been raising the issue for some time that dry waste is getting dumped by the side of the lake. On Sunday night, such waste caught fire and the smoke spread to such an extent that we could not even stand on our balcony,"" said Prabir Kumar Bose, a former director of NIT and a resident of the area.

"At 1.4 lakh in 2019, Maharashtra No. 2 in toxic air deaths","MUMBAI: Maharashtra, which has safer air parameters than many north Indian states, is second in the statewise list of premature deaths due to air pollution in 2019. The state recorded 1.4 lakh air pollution-linked deaths while UP recorded the highest with 3.5 lakh deaths. The all-India figure is 17 lakh deaths - 18% of all the fatalities - in 2019; corresponding percentage for state is 16.7.Air pollution robs state's GDP of nearly Rs 7,200crMaharashtra is second in the country after Uttar Pradesh on premature deaths caused by air pollution in 2019. The finding is part of a scientific paper published by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in The Lancet Planetary Health. The study was conducted for ICMR's State-Level Disease Burden Initiative along with Public Health Foundation of India and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.Senior author of the study, Dr Lalit Dandona, said, ""The economic impact of this health loss due to lost productivity is huge, at 1.4% of the country's GDP in 2019, besides a roughlyestimated expenditure of 0.4% of the GDP on treatment of air pollution-related diseases."" /The paper put Maharashtra's economic loss at $972 million (over Rs 7,182 crore) which was above Uttar Pradesh's $876 million. The nationwide amount was calculated at $8 billion.Public health risk will worsen if other states compare pollution levels with Delhi or the Gangetic states and become complacent, warned Anumita Roy Choudhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi. She said new data on Maharashtra has reconfirmed what we know from science that most of the deaths occur at a level of pollution that is much lower than what we experience in Delhi.There is more bad news for Maharashtra. ""In terms of economic loss due to lost output due to illnesses attributable to air pollution, Maharashtra suffered the most,"" said Dr P C Gupta from Healis Health Foundation and a collaborator for the Lancet study.ICMR director general Prof Balram Bhargava said, ""While 40% of the disease burden due to air pollution is from lung diseases, the remaining 60% is from ischemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and neonatal deaths related to preterm birth, highlighting the broadranging impact of air pollution on human health.""Roy Choudhury further said that the findings should serve as a warning for the Maharashtra government to cut emissions from vehicles, industries, power plants and waste. ""In addition to particulate pollution, pay attention to growing ozone levels that is worsening the health risk,"" said Choudhury.Maharashtra has 18 non-attainment cities out of 122 cities identified under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) that aims to reduce the PM2.5 (respirable, pollution particles) concentrations by 20-30% by 2024 from the 2017 levels. ""It is also important to take steps at a regional scale and not be limited to cities because pollution blows across administrative boundaries,"" she said.A recent study by CSE found that even though the overall average level of PM2.5 for the 11 months in 2020 is considerably lower than the previous year due to the lockdown, PM2.5 levels in winter rose beyond the standard in the Greater Mumbai Region and the rest of Maharashtra.

Last year in November, chief minister Ashok Gehlot had raised concern saying Delhi's pollution was approaching Jaipur. Since, Delhi is one of the worst-affected states due to air pollution, Rajasthan is continuously measuring its air pollution levels and expressing concern over it.The report ""Health and economic impact of air pollution in the states of India: The Global Burden of Disease Study 2019"" says that the economic loss attributable to air pollution as a percentage of state GDP varied from 0.67% to2.15%. It was the highest in the states of Uttar Pradesh (2.15%), Bihar (1.95%), Madhya Pradesh (1.7%), Rajasthan (1.7%) and Chhattisgarh (1.55%), which have a relatively low per-capita GDP, and in Punjab (1.52%) and Uttrakhand (1.5%), which have relatively high per-capita GDP.""Rajasthan is spending 1% of its GDP on health but the economic loss due to air pollution which the state is facing is 1.7% of the GDP, which is much higher than the state is spending on health sector,"" said Dr Virendra Singh, city-based pulmonologist and one of the collaborators from the state in State-Level Disease Burden Initiative Air Pollution study.The economic loss due to lost output from premature deaths and morbidity attributable to household air pollution as a percentage of state GDP in the state was 0.79%.

Gurugram: Brace for fresh cold wave from Sun,"GURUGRAM/NEW DELHI: The city will witness a cold wave again from Sunday, according the meteorological department. The wave, a Met official said, will continue till January 1. During this period, the minimum temperature is likely to remain between 1 and 3C, while the maximum temperature will be around 16C.Cold wave is recorded when the minimum temperature is 4C or below that.On Friday, the minimum temperature was 6.5C and maximum was 23C. Dense fog engulfed parts of the city early morning on Friday. Meanwhile, the city's air quality remained in the 'very poor' category on Friday. /The air quality index (AQI) of the city was 302, a few notches less than that of the previous day, which was 361. ""We hope that the city's air quality will improve in the coming days as the wind speed is likely to increase. Also, wind from snow-clad mountains will bring some relief from the pollutants,"" said a senior official of Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB).Doctors pointed out that residents should be careful about the cold wave as there is a rise of 16% pneumonia cases in children, especially younger ones in the range of one to five years' old. Pneumonia is the most serious respiratory infection (ARI) and kills about 17% infants in India, according to experts.""Pneumonia is a viral and contagious respiratory disease that affects children more as they breathe faster than adults. We have received 18 cases since November. We attend to a maximum of 16 cases usually. Most children are in the age of 1 to 5 years. Those who are living in crowded homes or have parents who smoke are more at risk. Also, those who breathe air polluted by biomass fuels used for cooking are also at risk. As pneumonia weakens lungs, these children will be more at the risk of contracting Covid-19 and will need to be extra careful,"" says Dr Sudip Chowdhury, consultant paediatrician, Columbia Asia Hospital, Gurgaon.Meanwhile in Delhi, the minimum temperature was 4.6 degrees Celsius on Friday - three notches below normal - and the maximum settled at 22.4 degrees Celsius - one degree above normal. Moderate fog was reported in parts of Delhi as the visibility dipped to 200 metres at Safdarjung station during morning hours. A Met official said the minimum temperature was likely to decrease on Saturday but would again rise on Sunday and Monday.Delhi's air quality on Friday improved to the middle end of 'very poor' category. The AQI was 357 as against 423 on Thursday, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Delhi had recorded three consecutive 'severe' days from Tuesday to Thursday. However, as the wind speed picked up on Friday, it helped in pushing the city's air from 'severe' to 'very poor' category by clearing the accumulated pollutants. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pollution causes 1.95% of GDP loss to Bihar: Study,"PATNA: Bihar is the second worst hit state in the country when it comes to gross domestic product (GDP) loss due to increasing air pollution (outdoor and household), which affect health of people and lead to premature deaths of many.According to a latest study published in medical journal Lancet, Bihar stands at the second position among all the states in the country where GDP loss is recorded at 1.95%, exactly 0.59% higher than the national average of 1.36%. At 2.15%, Uttar Pradesh has suffered the maximum GDP loss.The economic loss per capita in Bihar was to the tune of $26.5. It was highest in Delhi at $62.The study, 'Health and economic impact of air pollution in the states of India: The global burden of disease study 2019', written as a collaborative effort by Indian institutions, including ICMR, says that the economic loss due to lost output from premature deaths and morbidity attributable to household air pollution as a percentage of state GDP in Bihar was 0.98%.Around 70% population in Bihar is still dependent on traditional method of cooking, such as wood, dung, agricultural residues, coal and charcoal.D M Diwakar, former director of A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies, said it's surprising that despite Centre's claim that Ujjwala Yojana has reached everyone, traditional cooking method is still used extensively in the state. /""People are so poor that they can't afford rising prices of LPG cylinder,"" he said.""The population using traditional cooking method is much higher than what the report says. In Bihar, there is only 11.3% urban population. The rural population is largely dependent on traditional cooking method,"" Diwakar added.Ashok Ghosh, chairman of Bihar State Pollution Control Board, said, ""We are trying our best to cut down the sources of air pollutants.

Mumbai sees 2020's worst air quality on New Year Eve,"MUMBAI: The city woke up to polluted skies on the last day of the year. Mumbai recorded an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of 313, the highest in 2020, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). The AQI marginally improved to 309 by Friday evening./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/AQI between 301 and 400 is considered very poor and triggers a health alert for everyone.On day one of the new year, SAFAR has forecast the AQI to be 293. An AQI between 201 and 300 is considered poor and people with heart or lung diseases and the elderly must reduce heavy or longer exertion and outdoor activity.This year's second-worst AQI was recorded on March 17-272. Mumbai's worst AQI-323-was recorded on January 1, 2016, the year SAFAR began monitoring air pollution levels.Researchers at SAFAR said that the high pollution levels were as a result of the wind conditions. ""AQI in Mumbai will continue to remain in the 'very poor' category due to inflow of continental air with low ventilation and hence, slow dispersion of accumulated pollution mainly from biomass burning areas of the city due to favourable wind direction,"" said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR.Among the 10 locations monitored by SAFAR, six areas-Malad, Mazagaon, Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), Chembur, Andheri and Navi Mumbai-recorded an AQI of over 300. The highest AQI of 363 was in BKC.This year, owning to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, Mumbai recorded a 76% decline in the NO2 level concentration, while PM 2.5 was down by 54% as opposed to the same period in 2019, according to a study by SAFAR.

Track the pollution level in your city,"Cheaper LPG may help the fight against pandemic, says PGI study","Chandigarh: Linking the supply of 'costlier' LPG during the lockdown and the spread of coronavirus infection, a study by PGI scientists has recommended reducing the price of the clean fuel to prevent insufficient access to clean energy, especially in the rural areas, which may aggravate the Covid-19 situation.In the study, published in a high-impact journal - Environment International, the researchers have reasoned that exposure to solid biomass fuels is associated with respiratory problems, such as reduced lung function and increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms, that could lead to exacerbation of respiratory diseases.""While the exact relationship between the exposure to air pollution and Covid-19 is not known, some evidences indicate that the areas in the US with higher air pollutant levels saw higher rates of Covid infection,"" said Dr Ravindra Khaiwal, corresponding author, department of community medicine and school for public health, PGI.The study mentions that in June this year, when 'Unlock 1' was announced, the rates of LPG cylinder were hiked nationwide after a consecutive price cut for three months. ""This will likely slow down the uptake of clean fuels. While transiting to clean fuel, price hikes should not punish the poor,"" said Dr Khaiwal.Even though during the economic slowdown in Covid-19, a relief package for free refilling of clean fuels was announced, considering the low financial stability of marginal households to afford clean fuels and to reduce the burden associated with air pollution, ""solid biomass fuels could not be entirely replaced by clean cooking fuels by just providing aid for three months"", mentions the study and adds, ""Governments can embark upon this issue by making the provision of clean cooking fuels as part of their standing emergency response plans.""Citing the instance of the Ghana government, which offered clean fuel at subsidised costs for the poorest consumers and also a 50% discount to other consumers, the researchers recommend such initiatives to address long-term challenges. /""Therefore, we recommended the creation of additional, targeted subsidies for at least a year following Covid as the employment scenario and the Indian economy recover. The cost of the LPG should be reduced as inferred,"" said Dr Khaiwal. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air pollution much bigger killer than Covid in India, finds study","Kolkata: Air pollution caused nearly 13 times the number of deaths in 2019 than the raging Covid-19 pandemic the following year in Bengal, according to a recent report published by The Lancet. And it's not just Bengal. The overall pollution-related deaths outnumber the countrywide Covid death figure by a huge margin.According to the 'December 2020 Lancet Planetary Health Report', 9,712 people died of Covid in Bengal last year, whereas pollution claimed 1.2 lakh lives (1,22,833 people) in 2019 and caused an economic loss of around Rs 15,516 crore.Looking at the data, it's clear which is the bigger killer across the country, even in a pandemic-ravaged year. Across India, there were as many as 16.7 lakh deaths attributable to pollution in 2019, while Covid caused 1.5 lakh deaths in 2020, according to data sourced from all state governments and the Centre. /Among the institutions that The Lancet collaborated with for the survey was Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which is at the forefront of strategizing the medical fraternity's response to Covid-19 in the country.Of the total deaths attributable to air pollution in India in 2019, the largest proportions were due to COPD (32.5%) and ischaemic heart disease (29.2%), followed by stroke (16.2%) and lower respiratory infections (11.2%).Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Bengal and Rajasthan accounted for over 50% of the air pollution-attributable deaths in India, according to data from The Lancet's report that was was conducted under the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative by ICMR, Public Health Foundation of India and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The estimation of the economic impact of air pollution, as the cost of lost output due to premature deaths and morbidity attributable to air pollution for every state of India, was done using the cost-of-illness method. ""Air pollution has clearly emerged as one of the biggest killers in India. Its impact on our economy is far-reaching. There is a long-drawn collective battle against it. A couple of doses of vaccine cannot prevent it. When Covid-19 has occupied the lion's share of our mind space, The Lancet study is a grim reminder of what we are missing out on,"" said Dr Arun Sharma, public health expert and professor of community medicine, University College of Medical Science, New Delhi. ""Air pollution is a major problem across India, and a much bigger issue across the Indo-Gangetic plain,"" said Centre for Science and Environment executive director and air pollution expert Anumita Roychowdhury. ""Bengal being at the tail end of the plain needs proactive steps to speed up action on transport, clean fuels in industry, clean power plants, waste management and biomass burning across the state."" Doctors, too, have reported an alarming rise in non-smoking COPD patients, primarily due to indoor and outdoor pollution. ""This is a bigger epidemic but currently going unnoticed because of our current obsession with Covid-19. The fast declining air quality in our urban areas has made even breathing injurious to health,"" said Dr Arup Haldar, a senior pulmonologist with Woodlands Hospital.Bengal Clean Air Network (Bengal CAN), which is spearheading a movement for better environment, is concerned about the current state of air quality in Bengal and the economic risk it poses to the population. ""We need an all-out collective effort to clean up the air,"" said Vinay Jaju of Bengal CAN. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Burning of wood, plastic now biggest air pollution factor","Mumbai: Harish Pandey, whose flat overlooks the Ganpat Patil Nagar slums in Dahisar, wakes up these days to the sight of a haze cloaking the neighbourhood. With mercury down, residents of the shanty settlement which adjoins a swathe of mangroves are burning wood to keep their tarpaulin-lined dwellings warm or to heat up water for bathing. ""The smoke travels into our homes and many in the area can't even keep their windows open,"" said Pandey.With winter setting in, wood or coal burnt for warmth or cooking and garbage set aflame for roadside bonfires are worsening the already polluted air. /Complaints of emissions from open burning of biomass and waste have increased as residents feel the impact on their health.For those who blame industry and traffic alone for blighting their ambient environment, a look at historical data may be sobering. According to System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), in 2016 as much as 27% of the PM 2.5 (particulate matter measuring lesser than 2.5 microns) generated in Mumbai came from use of biofuels in residential-slums, open burning, fires, etc. ""Not just slums or standalone homes, but the security staff at most housing societies also burn wood to keep themselves warm during winter nights,"" said Pandey.While the civic body's Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 prohibit waste burning, garbage is often burnt along bylanes or in industrial units with complete impunity. According to a factory owner from Mulund, ""There are various small industrial units right outside our compound. The society has refused to avail the civic body's services for their waste to be picked up. Instead, they burn it during the night causing harm to the health of the residents who live in the vicinity. The waste is toxic and one can feel an itch in the throat almost immediately.""Recently, activist Sumaira Abdulali wrote to state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray demanding tougher rules to prohibit open burning. Abdulali's NGO Awaaz Foundation measured PM 2.5 concentration along a stretch in Bhiwandi where garbage was being piled up and burnt last year and found it to be over 612 microgrammes per cubic metre. ""We found pollution levels had a direct correlation with the size of the garbage dump burning. It is impossible to control air pollution solely through generalized Air Quality Index (AQI) monitoring, unless individual sources are also identified and tackled one by one,"" she said.While the city's pollution levels are in check due to natural factors during the four monsoon months, AQI begins to spike as winter sets in because as temperature dips, the inversion layer - height beyond which pollutants cannot disperse - is lowered and pollutants stay closer to the earth's surface. On Wednesday, overall AQI was 309. AQI between 301 and 400 is considered very poor and triggers a health alert.

"Air quality drops with rise in garbage, overflow at landfills","Mumbai: As the problem of open burning rages across the city despite complaints, urban local bodies like BMC are coming under greater scrutiny for solid waste management and redressal mechanisms. Introducing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in the kitchens of the poor under a government scheme is one solution that has helped reduce burning of biomass like wood and coal to an extent in recent years. However, as waste continues to swell in volume, its disposal remains a challenge.Satish Sinha, associate director of Toxics Link, a Delhi-based NGO said, ""Urban local bodies need to provide resources to citizens to ensure that waste is disposed of in the right manner. Currently, waste collection isn't available at the last mile in several pockets of the city. /The civic body must provide for compost of dry garden waste which is often burnt every few days. Once there is a provision for disposal, the civic body can take penal action against those who do not use it.""A frequent hot spot for open burning is near recycling units such as in Dharavi. Hence experts suggest that government provide designated spaces for it. ""Unorganised, unregulated units burn all the waste they gather to separate metal from plastic. These fires are very harmful to human health. Instead, government must provide space away from residential areas where recyclers can set up their sheds and carry out their work,"" said Vinod Shetty, director, Dharavi Recyclers' Collective.Several non-profits are also aiming for micro solutions. For instance, Pune-based Samuchit Enviro Tech has developed a stove that uses dried leaves and twigs as fuel and emits less smoke. The group has been encouraging housing societies to provide these to security staff that use bonfires to stay warm during winters.Environment activist Sumaira Abdulali said awareness was the key not just among citizens but also authorities. ""People must report whenever they see an instance of open burning. Social media could be used to report with pictures as well,"" she said. Abdulali, over the last year, monitored air quality near open burning sites in Bhiwandi and found concentration of particulate matter was nearly 100 times the permissible limits.To cut pollution from solid fuels burnt for cooking, the Central mission for 'smoke free' status has gained momentum in the past four years with introduction of LPG in the kitchens of the poor. By replacing more than 3,000 wood-fired stoves with LPG in the state daily since 2016, as many as 44,22,390 households have now said 'No' to smoke and are using clean fuel for cooking.Under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) launched in 2016, LPG connections were subsidised besides providing a loan to meet the cost of LPG adoption. The scheme resulted in over 44 lakh new connections in Maharashtra, of which over a lakh were in Mumbai metropolitan region. The emphasis was more in rural areas where the problem was severe, but urban households, especially in the slum pockets, were covered, a senior official from an oil marketing company said.Household air pollution caused mainly by burning of solid fuels-firewood, charcoal, coal, dung, and agricultural waste-and ambient air pollution were the factors which led to the government launching the scheme nationwide in 2016 in 715 districts, including 36 in Maharashtra. During the pandemic, the scheme was a huge relief to beneficiaries as government gave free of cost LPG refills to Ujjwala consumers for three months -- April, May and June, 2020.

"IMA, TNPCB root for smoke-free Bhogi celebrations tomorrow","Coimbatore: The Indian Medical Association's (IMA) Coimbatore branch and the Tamil Nadu pollution control board (TNPCB) have requested people to refrain from burning old stuff on Wednesday to mark bhogi, as it will cause air pollution.Compared to earlier years, when people burnt organic waste like brooms, nowadays discarded tyres and plastic products are set on fire, producing carbon monoxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, benzene, formaldehyde and butadiene. ""When plastic is burnt, people can get exposed to dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyl and furan,"" said Ramesh Karthik, assistant engineer of Coimbatore north.Getting exposed to the toxins can be lethal for people who have recently been infected by Covid-19. Smoke may worsen the condition of wheezing patients and make them more vulnerable if they contract Covid-19.""Lungs will be the first to be affected by Covid-19,"" said pulmonologist Dr Nandagopal. /""For people whose lungs have been affected by the virus, it can lead to many complications when they inhale smoke from burning of toxic wastes. It could lead to more exacerbations and coughing, among others,"" he said. ""For people who suffer lung fibrosis, their airways are already shrunk, and when they inhale smoke, it can lead to issues like breathlessness.""Air pollution levels in the city is within the government-specified levels, TNPCB officials said. ""If large-scale burnings occur, air quality level may turn worse for a few hours. We have air pollution sensors at Saibaba Colony, Kavundampalayam, Kurichi and PSG College of Arts and Science. So far, air pollution has not been widespread enough to be caught on these sensors during bhogi,"" said Karthik. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Delhi's air worst since Nov 10, no relief likely before Monday","New Delhi: Friday was Delhi's worst air day in over two months, with the air quality index (AQI) touching 460 in the ""severe"" category due to a mixture of low wind speed, high relative humidity and a low boundary layer trapping pollutants closer to the surface. A visible haze blanket remained throughout the day and visibility was low. The last time Delhi had a higher AQI was on November 10 when it was 476, but stubble burning was then a factor. /The current scenario is all down to meteorological factors, with conditions not expected to improve much in the next 48 hours, said experts. At 429, AQI deteriorated to ""severe"" on Thursday.Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at India Meteorological Department and head of Regional Weather Forecasting Centre in Delhi, said the city was experiencing ""calm winds"", with speed only touching 5km/hour during the day. ""Only from Monday will wind speed pick up, with easterly winds influencing the region. Some dispersal may take place then,"" said Srivastava.""There is moisture in the atmosphere and pollutants are gradually accumulating in the air. The air quality has, therefore, worsened over the last 24 hours. The boundary layer is also low due to low temperatures. All these factors are combining to cause such a situation,"" he added.According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), this is likely to be the first prolonged ""extreme air pollution event"" of 2021 and secondary particulate formation may also occur. ""The minimum temperature is likely to fall further. AQI is forecast to deteriorate further and rapidly,"" SAFAR stated. ""The secondary particulate formation, which multiplies the finer particles under congenital conditions, have already started as predicted and will accelerate under present conditions,"" it added. Extremely low ventilation and shallow boundary layer height are adding to the severity. Delhi experiences greater visibility reduction than other polluted megacities under such conditions due to some unique chemical composition of particulates related to specific source emissions, SAFAR pointed out. According to CPCB's central control room, Delhi-NCR's 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration was over five times the standard at 335 micrograms per cubic metre at 8pm. The average PM10 concentration was 483 micrograms per cubic metre. The standards for PM2.5 and PM10 are 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"'Mahagenco using high ash coal, causing pollution'","Nagpur: Mahagenco has been using high ash coal in its thermal power stations, shows data obtained under Right to Information (RTI) Act by activist Anil Wadpalliwar. Meanwhile, Grahak Panchayat office-bearer Shriram Satpute has written a letter to chief engineer of Khaparkheda thermal power station asking him to take immediate steps to reduce air pollution in the area.Some years ago, the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) had asked thermal power plants not to use coal with more than 34% ash content. This figure was arrived at after detailed studies. /However, the ministry did away with this requirement in mid-2020.Information obtained by Wadpalliwar shows that Koradi thermal power station used high ash coal throughout year 2020. In May, the average ash content of coal was as high as 46.27%. The lowest was in September - 38.82%.Chandrapur super thermal power station used high ash coal throughout 2020 for units 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. The highest ash content was 41.89% in November. For the new units 8 and 9, Mahagenco used coal with ash content below 34% in January and February 2020, but more than this limit after that.Satpute in his letter to the Khaparkheda CE, a copy of which has been sent to Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), states that he had written letters to the CE in January last year regarding poisonous emissions from the power plant, but no action was taken in this regard.""Consequently, air pollution in Khaparkheda and neighbouring Chicholi area has increased in the following months. People living in the area are suffering from various respiratory ailments like cold, cough and asthma. I too have contracted asthma due to regular exposure to Khaparkheda emissions. The crop productivity in the area has also been severely affected,"" stated Satpute.Earlier, Sunita Gher, Congress's former zilla parishad member from Chicholi, had written a strongly-worded letter to Khaparkheda power plant CE charging him with doing nothing to reduce pollution. Under the RTI Act, Wadpalliwar had also obtained data of respiratory diseases, which showed high incidence in Khaparkheda area.According to data supplied by Chicholi public health centre (PHC) officials to Wadpalliwar, between January and October 2020, 639 people were afflicted by influenza-like illnesses, 2,956 suffered from common cold and cough, two had pneumonia and two suffered from bronchitis.

'Planned thermal plants could kill 8.4L people',"If India were to set up every coal-powered plant it has planned, its power generation capacity would go from 200GW in 2018 to 300GW by 2030. The cost of this expansion, however, would be 8.4 lakh lives.A study by researchers from the University of Maryland, Urban Emissions Info, University of Massachusetts Amherst and Texas Tech University, published by the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, has found that 78,000 deaths in India were already attributable to coal plants in 2018, the base year for the study. If all coal plants in the pipeline were set up, deaths linked to them would go up to 1,12,000 annually. And the lifetime impact of these new plants is estimated to be 8,44,000 premature deaths. /""We first run the model using estimates of emissions of PM2.5, NOx and SO2 from all sources except power plants in 2018... We run the model again, adding power plant emissions from 2018... In the third run, we add emissions from planned plants,"" lead author Dr Maureen Cropper told TOI. Then, mortality was calculated for stroke, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections, diabetes mellitus and lung cancer.They found that ambient PM2.5 in 2018 was 53.5g/m3 - higher in the Indo-Gangetic plain and in areas with high coal-powered plants than in southern India - which would increase to 55.9g/m3 if all planned plants started operating. With new plants, the share of coal-fired power plants to PM2.5 would go up from 9% in 2018 to 13% by 2030 across the country.""In Odisha and Jharkhand, where planned plants double installed coal capacity, deaths increase by 50%,"" the paper said. ""Bihar and West Bengal are downwind of large expansions of capacity in Jharkhand and Odisha and, under the assumption that current pollution control practices continue, will experience significant health impacts from cross-border pollution.""Two things could change the scale of this impact in opposite ways - households switching to cleaner fuels and full implementation of new air regulations. ""In Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh, over 75% households burn solid fuels for cooking; in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, approximately two-thirds of households do,"" the paper said. ""When people are already inhaling a lot of PM2.5 from household air pollution, the impact of power plant emissions is much smaller than if they were not exposed to household air pollution,"" Cropper explained.And while there are regulations for thermal power plant emissions, notified in 2015, they are not being enforced. The study calculated that mere implementation of the 2015 regulations would reduce coal power plant PM2.5 by up to 70% every year. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Toxic times: Air in major MP cities 'not fit for breathing',"Bhopal: Air quality of major cities in Madhya Pradesh -including Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior and Jabalpur - ranges between moderate to poor. It means the air quality is 'not fit for breathing' and may lead to discomfort, as per the pollution control board.Allocation of Rs 150 crore in the Union budget to clean the air quality of the four MP cities confirms the fact that there is need to take immediate steps to control the deteriorating air quality.As per Union budget, in the financial year 2021-22, around Rs 150 crore has been allocated to clean air pollution. It is part of the Rs 2200 crore kept for 42 cities in the country. /The sum would be given to six different departments - including urban administration, transport, agriculture, industries, environment and energy - to take steps to control pollution. Dust and smoke would be checked under these measures taken to control pollution.Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, increase in nitrogen oxide is caused by human activity, including vehicles and sewage etc.PM 10 depends on dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of these four, PM2.5 is the most harmful for health since it causes severe lung diseases, said officials.Air quality index between 0 and 50 is termed as good with minimal possible health impacts while air quality between 51 and 100 is satisfactory but may lead to minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people. Air quality above 100 is moderate and leads to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. AQI of Bhopal and Indore was between 100 and 200 on Tuesday.AQI above 200 leads to breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. The AQI of Gwalior and Jabalpur was between 200 and 300. AQI above 300 may cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure as per the pollution control board. In MP, Gwalior and Jabalpur are more polluted when compared to Bhopal and Indore, as per the central pollution control board. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Mumbai: Dry grass burning scorches four puppies in Kharghar; several trees damaged,"NAVI MUMBAI: A major fire following burning of dry grass led to the death of four newborn puppies in Kharghar near Navi Mumbai in Maharashtra's Raigad district on Wednesday afternoon.Several trees were also damaged. While the mother dog managed to escape the fire, she could not save her pups even though she tried to shift them to another sIte behind Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering building, where the grass burning took place in sector 7.A TOI photographer who was present on the spot at the time of the fire took photos of the charred bodies of the pups. Animal activist Vijay Rangare of People for Animals (PFA, Unit-2) said that he has contacted the Kharghar police in order to lodge an FIR in this matter.""Every year during this time, some unknown people burn dry grass which results in a lot of smoke and air pollution. /Green trees also get damaged while at times animals like cats and puppies living there are also killed. This madness of burning dry grass must be stopped by the authorities,"" said Rangare.Recently, dry grass burning was also seen along the Harbour Line railway track in Seawoods and at the Jewel of Navi Mumbai public park in Nerul.Earlier, in another location of Kharghar, wildlife species like mongoose and reptiles were found to be burnt to death due to such dry grass burning incidents.Local residents said that they have often called the fire brigade as well as the forest department officials whenever such fires are noticed in the developed nodes or along the hill slopes, but it is often a case of too little too late.While the Kharghar fire brigade personnel rushed to the site in sector 7 on Wednesday, smoke and minor flames due to restarting of the fire in an area of 10 acres continued for several hours.

Air pollution is a growing problem around the world. Is it linked to Lung Cancer?,"According to the World Health Organisation, air pollution or particle pollution is a significant cause of lung cancer. It is estimated that, lung cancer caused due to air pollution leads to 1.8 million deaths globally every year, accounting for 29% of all lung cancer related deaths. Smoke and dust from any source is the main cause of air pollution. It is usually generated through vehicle exhaust, coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources and can cause lung cancer. /While the bigger particles that we breathe in can be disposed from the body through sneezing and coughing, the smaller ones can get trapped in the lungs, affecting it. These particles interfere with the development and functioning of the lungs. Why it is crucial now more than ever to generate awareness about lung health issues caused by pollution?Air pollution causes serious damage to the respiratory tract. Research suggests that it can lead to lung conditions such as Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, emphysema (condition causing shortness of breath) and lung cancer in addition to worsening existing respiratory illnesses. It is commonly believed that smoking cigarette causes lung cancer. However, lung cancer can also affect those who do not smoke or consume tobacco. Factors like second-hand smoke and inhalation of radon and asbestos can also lead to lung cancer. The British Medical Journal (BMJ) has highlighted the increasing linkage between outdoor pollution and mortality and morbidity from non-malignant cardiovascular and respiratory disease and lung cancer. Despite the severe and permanent health damage caused by air pollution, people are still largely unaware of its fatal implications. Hence, there is a need to spread awareness about the perils of air pollution and undertake necessary precautionary measures at an individual level to prevent it from becoming a public health emergency. How does lung cancer begin and how it can impact an individual as it progresses?Lung cancer originates when the cells in the lungs start growing abnormally. They typically originate in the bronchi (tubes in the windpipe that enter the lungs), bronchioles (smaller branches of bronchi) and alveoli (tiny air sacs at the end of the bronchioles). The symptoms of lung cancer include persistent coughing which worsens over time, coughing up blood, phlegm or spit, shortness of breath, chest pain, hoarseness, bone pain, headache and unexplained weight loss. Lung cancer is a progressive condition and below are the different stages of the disease: Stage I: The cancer is located only in the lungs and does not spread to any lymph nodeStage II: The cancer spreads to the nearby lymph nodeStage III: The cancer in the lung spreads to the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest. This stage is also known as locally advanced disease Stage IV: This is the most advanced stage and is also described as advanced disease. In this stage, the cancer spreads to both lungs, including the fluid in the area around the lungs, or to another part of the body such as the liver or other organs What is the impact lifestyle and environment can have on the disease? The following preventive measures can be undertaken for reducing the risk of lung cancer from air pollution:Avoid smoking as it is one of the most common pollutants, both outdoor and indoors Household cleaning items may contain harsh chemicals, the fumes of which can be detrimental De-clutter the house and ensure it is well ventilated Use a dehumidifier and/or air conditioner to reduce moisture Vacuum and dust surfaces frequently Choose a cleaner commuteAvoid burning leaves, trash, and other materials Limit or avoid exposure to cancer-causing agents like in asbestos, radioactive ores such as uranium, inhaled chemicals such as arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, silica, vinyl chloride, nickel etc. If one is a regular smoker, what is their life expectancy when they are diagnosed with lung cancer?The life expectancy post diagnosis of lung cancer depends on the stage of diagnosis. When diagnosed early i.e. during Stage 1 and 2, cure is possible in most patients. However, when we reach stage 3, cure is possible in some cases by a combined treatment with Chemotherapy, Surgery and Radiotherapy. On the other hand, in Stage 4, we focus on controlling the cancer and not curing the disease. Thus, it is vital that we take all measures to prevent lung cancer and diagnose it as early as possible.

Air pollution and cold weather are the main reasons cited for the increasing number of patients suffering from skin and respiratory disorders.Meanwhile, 12 children have been detected with malnutrition, 470 people have been detected with hypertension, 301 with liver-related problems, 182 with anaemia, two with cancer and 16 with Hepatitis B. ""The Jan Arogya Mela could not be organised last year post-February due to Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, it was started this year from January 10. So far, we have screened 12,888 people in the district over five Sundays across 33 PHCs which include 15 in urban and 18 in rural areas. /Maximum patients were detected with skin related problems while at second number were patients with respiratory disorders at 18%. Mostly these cases have been related to air pollution and cold weather as people in rural areas are more exposed to extreme weather conditions with open fields etc.,"" said Dr Rajesh Sharma, the district malaria officer (DMO) handling the fair. Sharma adds that due guidelines and medication have been provided to those detected with skin and respiratory disorders such as moisturizing the skin with oil or lotion and avoiding dust and polluted air.""Many who are smokers have been given counselling while asthmatic patients have been strictly directed to ensure protection from smoke and dust,"" he said. While 2,002 people were examined at Covid help desks set up for the purpose, 1,299 people were tested with rapid antigen tests. None came positive. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"2 IITs, Teri to locate sources of pollution","New Delhi: After getting unsatisfactory results from the real-time source apportionment study carried out by Washington University, Delhi government has now approached IIT-Kanpur, IIT-Delhi and The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) to carry out the same.On Tuesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal met researchers from the three institutes and asked them to not only carry out the study, but also set up an advanced monitoring system for each source of pollution.Delhi government is looking to receive real-time data to determine the most polluting sources at any given time of the year, thereby allowing it to take action on a priority basis. Kejriwal said he had directed senior officials to start work and submit a proposal to the state cabinet.""IIT-Kanpur, IIT-Delhi and Teri have developed technology for real-time source apportionment of pollution. Had a meeting with their experts. /We will work with them to implement it in Delhi. If we know the source of pollution on a real-time basis, it will help us take immediate action,"" Kejriwal tweeted.Kejriwal said with the implementation of the electric vehicle policy, they were looking at actively bringing down different sources of pollution. ""Delhi government is focusing on the sources of pollution and working to curb them. This technique will give a clear idea about the real-time sources of air pollution at hotspots. It will also help us take immediate action against these sources,"" he added.With the help of technology, officials said real-time sources and the intensity of pollution could be detected. The technology would also give clarity on the factors responsible for the spike in air pollution at a particular spot. ""This technology will help in studying the real-time effects of vehicular emission, dust and smoke from factories. Based on the results, Delhi government will take the necessary action to curb the sources of pollution,"" said an official.The government aims to establish a super site and a mobile site to find the sources of pollution in real-time at any given hotspot. Work for this would first be done on a pilot basis. The entire project would be carried out under the guidance of professor Mukesh Sharma from IIT-Kanpur.A senior DPCC official said the proposal from IIT-Kanpur would be assessed by an expert committee and the project would commence after receiving clearances. ""The results from the Washington University study were not satisfactory. It did not meet the objectives and the methodology was also slightly different. Therefore, we did not proceed with them,"" added the official. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Why indoor air pollutants can be as dangerous as outdoor air pollutants,"With most of us having spent months within the confines of our homes during the pandemic, we haven't felt safer than before. What could possibly affect our health while we are indoors? Well, little do we know that while we may be safe from outdoor pollutants, there are certain indoor allergens that can make us prone to serious allergies. /We all believe that sweeping, mopping, dusting are enough to make your homes clean and allergy proof. There are traces of hidden dust consisting of cockroach allergens, dust mites allergens, dog allergens, mould, bacteria and fungi commonly present in surfaces where we eat, sit, play and sleep. And traditional methods of cleaning may not really help in fully eliminating them.Dr. Lancelot Pinto, Consultant Pulmonologist, P.D Hinduja Hospital & MRC, ""A common symptom reported by a majority of patients with asthma is the triggering of symptoms when they clean the house, remove clothes from closets, or when they notice mold in the monsoons. House dust mites, pet dander, smokes and fumes from poorly ventilated kitchens are all common triggers for worsening of symptoms and triggering of attacks, and these are all related to the indoor environment. At the workplace, poor air conditioning, dust from carpets and enclosed spaces all contribute to worsening of symptoms. We focus a lot on outdoor air pollution, but forget that it is not the only contributor to indoor air quality, and given that most of us spend a majority of our day indoors, we definitely need to focus more on improving the indoor air quality."" In a recent study conducted by FRAC and Dyson titled 'Indian Households Hidden Dust', there were some shocking findings. Most houses showed the presence of dog and dust mite allergens. Dust mite and cockroach allergens are common triggers of all-year round allergy and asthma symptoms. Moulds type of fungus that typically grows in damp areas within homes and cars in warm conditions trigger allergies. The study showed that fungi were commonly present in dust collected from car interiors. Moreover, the health risks to babies from pollutants in household dust may be 100 times greater than for adults.Not only this, the air in your home can contain myriad substances, from particles like dust, allergens, gases, VOCs, NO2 and benzene. These substances are known for their potential to cause respiratory and cardiovascular health problems. They can also irritate eyes, throat and skin leading to various allergic reactions. Long term exposure to high levels of dust can cause health problems especially amongst young children, elderlies, and ones with pre-existing respiratory and heart conditions. This creates a huge need to adopt more effective methods of cleaning and follow a routine clean-up to eliminate every ounce of those hidden dust, making our home not just germ free but also the safest place to be. Some of the techniques to use are Using natural cleaning productsVacuuming regularly if you have pets at homeVentilating and cleaning frequently to get rid of dust and pollen allergensMonitoring indoor air quality For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Core health depts have got significant Budget hike: FM,"NEW DELHI: Allocations for three core departments of health - department of health and family welfare, Ayush and department of health research - have increased significantly in Budget 2021-22, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Friday countering criticism that the actual rise is modest despite the 137% increase in health and wellness Budget.Comparing the Budget estimates for the three key segments, Sitharaman said the BE for department of health and family welfare increased to Rs 71,269 crore in 2021-22, up 9.6% from Rs 65,012 crore last year; the allocation for Ayush increased by 40% to Rs 2,970 crore from Rs 2,122 crore in BE 2020-21; and the allocation for department of health research is Rs 2,663 crore, up 26.8% from Rs 2,100 crore.She also said it was surprising that while sanitation and water were seen as essential to health objectives, these were being questioned. ""Let's not be carried away by this debate that you brought in water and sanitation here, you brought in Poshan here. The core three for which everybody looks up for figures, we have increased, increased and increased,"" Sitharaman said in the Rajya Sabha.The total Budget outlay for 'health and wellbeing' increased to Rs 2,23,846 crore in 2021-22, against only Rs 94,452 crore last year.Despite the exponential hike of 137% in the backdrop of pandemic highlighting importance of health, the budget was criticised as water supply, sanitation, and mitigation of air pollution etc were bundled under a new head of ""health and wellness"".Responding to such criticism, the FM quoted the World Health Organisation (WHO) to bring home the importance of safe drinking water and sanitation for health, particularly to prevent tropical diseases. /WHO mentions safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) as crucial to human health and well being. It says safe and sufficient WASH plays a key role in preventing numerous critical tropical diseases.""It was felt that by bringing drinking water and sanitation into health, we are probably not showing the entire picture and probably health - the core department of health and family welfare Budget has come down. If I compare just BE to BE that is not true,"" Sitharaman said.""The increase in allocation for water have been based on the objective to provide tap water to ensure health for all in the long run,"" the FM said.

"Air pollution behind at least 11,000 deaths in Hyd last yr: Report","Hyderabad: The city recorded an estimated 11,000 avoidable deaths and suffered economic loss worth Rs 11,637 crore due to air pollution in 2020, reveals the Greenpeace Southeast Asia Analysis of IQAir data, released on Thursday. The report titled 'Cost to economy due to air pollution 2021' analysed impact of particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5) on deaths and economy in major cities across the world. PM 2.5 is referred to as particulate matter that is found in smoke and haze and has different diameters. /It severely impacts heart and respiratory system, and increases the likelihood of deaths due to cancer and stroke, spike in asthma attacks. It also worsens severity of Covid-19 symptoms.The global action advisory group used a cost estimator, an online tool developed by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, to track real-time health impact and economic costs of PM 2.5 in six Indian cities - Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai and Lucknow.Despite a temporary reprieve in air quality owing to the nationwide lockdown, figures released by Greenpeace underscore the need to act immediately. Experts have attributed vehicular pollution as the single biggest reason for deteriorating air quality in Hyderabad in addition to fossil fuel burning, construction, opening landfill burning, landfill fires of solid waste.""Hyderabad is a part of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). However, just having a concept note on NCAP will not help. The government needs to have specific targets for pollution emitting sources and control them within a time-frame,"" said Avinash Chanchal, climate campaigner, Greenpeace, India. The damage is equally worrying in other Indian cities with Delhi recording the highest number of avoidable deaths (54,000) followed by 25,000 in Mumbai, 12,000 in Bengaluru, 11,000 in Chennai and 6,700 in Lucknow.Experts have called for a need to promote low cost, active and carbon neutral transport options, increased use of clean energy and clean transport. ""The fact that poor air quality claimed an estimated 1,60,000 lives in the five largest cities alone should give us pause, especially in a year when many cities saw lower air pollution levels due to less economic activity. Governments, corporations and individuals must do more to eliminate the sources of air pollution and make our cities better places to live,"" said Frank Hammes, chief executive officer of IQAir.

"Why air inside schools, colleges may be toxic","New Delhi: Schools and colleges in the city are at a higher risk of indoor air pollution due to poor ventilation and use of chalk and other items that increase the level of volatile organic compounds.This was revealed in a study released on Friday by IIT Delhi's Centre of Excellence for Research on Clean Air (CERCA). It added that schools and colleges had PM10 and PM2.5 concentration much beyond WHO standards. The PM2.5 input-output ratio was more than one in all the selected six schools.The baseline survey titled Project MAQUID (Monitoring of Air Quality in Urban Indoors in Delhi) was conducted by IIT-Delhi in association with Society for Indoor Environment and Kaiterra, an air quality instrument company, at 37 sites, including schools, colleges, hospitals, restaurants, residential buildings, shopping malls and cinemas, from October 15, 2019 to January 30, 2020. Monitoring was done 24x7 in most of the selected buildings using air quality monitors.""We want to raise awareness about indoor air quality because people spend more than 90% of their time in indoor environments,"" said CERCA founder Arun Duggal.The study mentioned that far less attention was paid to indoor air pollution in urban areas due to the complex nature and types of indoor environments. Multiple sources, such as tobacco smoking, building materials, occupant activities and poorly maintained ventilation systems, can co-exist in urban buildings and make the pollution levels worse.The pollutants of prime concern could be particulate matter, gases, biological aerosols and volatile organic compounds, according to existing studies on different buildings across the world, which can affect the health and well-being of the occupants.It was found that the concentration of both PM10 and PM2.5 was 2-5 times higher than the permissible limits set by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for ambient air quality and 10-15 times higher than the WHO 24-hour average limits. /It was also revealed that despite a ban on smoking in public spaces, it was rampant in offices, hospitals and colleges.The level of volatile organic compounds was the highest in hospitals and restaurants due to the rampant use of chemical cleaning agents, floor cleaners and cooking oils.CERCA has called for more education and awareness on the sources and effects of indoor air quality with mitigation solutions. ""There needs to be a comprehensive assessment of indoor air quality, including the presence of bacteria and viruses in existing public spaces. Also, national standards or guidelines on indoor air quality should be developed by Union ministry of environment and CPCB based on available scientific knowledge and research studies,"" the report stated.Meanwhile, during the webinar in which the report was released, hackers drew obscene images on the screen before the intrusion was removed.

IIT-G comes up with fuel-friendly cooking stoves,"GUWAHATI: The researchers at IIT Guwahati have come up with a cooking solution that can cut down on fuel consumption by almost 40% and emission of harmful gases thereby creating cleaner homes and environment. The innovative cooking stoves can run on any fuel whether it is kerosene, LPG or biogas and are fitted with especially designed porous radiant (PRB) burners.The USP of the innovation is the use of advanced combustion technology, which has made the cooking stoves energy-efficient, economical and eco-friendly. The research team believes the work will have a global impact on burner-based applications and their multi-billion-dollar market. /They plan to commercialize the technology in a year's time and corroborate with industrial partners to extend the reach of these stoves in the Indian market.""For domestic cooking applications, we can save about 30% fuel. For commercial applications, 40-43% fuel can be saved,"" P Muthukumar, who developed the technology with his research team, told TOI on Tuesday.Minimizing emission, which has been a prime concern in conventional burners, he said this innovation is a milestone. ""Highly harmful carbon monoxide emission can be reduced to one third as compared to convention burners, whereas nitric oxide emission is almost zero,"" he added. ""The findings of these developments have been patented and the PRBs can be effectively used for domestic as well as community and commercial cooking. The prototypes needed for the invention have been developed in-house and are rigorously tested against available BIS standards,"" Muthukumar said. He went on to stress that having access to reliable, clean and modern cooking energy improves the standard of living. ""The provision of clean cooking energy also addresses concerns related to food security, climate change and health care,"" he added.A recently published article in the Lancet Planetary Health Journal reported that household pollution led to 0.65 M deaths which amount to 6.5% of the total deaths in India. Similarly, household air pollution is also responsible for 4.5% of the total disease burden (measured as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)). These deaths and morbidity eventually add up to huge monetary losses that further add to the economic burden of the country. Household air pollution is caused mainly by the use of polluting cooking fuels and inefficient cooking stoves. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
No summer respite from air pollution,"Hyderabad: It's the onset of summer but air pollution levels in the city continue to be as bad as they were during winter. As per the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) figures, the air quality index (AQI) in the city is steadily rising with Sanathnagar slipping into the 'poor' category by recording AQI of 201 on Thursday. In the last one month, the AQI level has been in the moderate category hovering between 100 and 150. Though winter is over, the air pollution in the city continues to remain in the moderate category with the air quality index recorded at 143 at the seven monitoring stations in the city on Thursday. /""Due to release of pollutants of industrial origin in the air, I often get headaches and nausea. Multiple complaints to the pollution board has yielded no result. The condition is much the same throughout the year irrespective of the season,"" said Divya B, a resident of Hafeezpet. Except Sanathnagar, other stations remained in the moderate category by recording AQI of 121-140, causing slight breathing discomfort to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. According to experts, during summer, radiation from the sun is stronger due to which nitrogen oxide reacts with hydrocarbons and other chemicals thereby polluting the quality of air. ""Typically, winter season has highest air pollution levels due to the change in wind pattern followed by summer. The air pollution during the monsoon season is the lowest due to rains,"" said Prasad Dasari, senior scientist, TSPCB. ""Last year, due to the lockdown, there was a slight drop in pollution levels in summer. With normalcy restored, the construction activities, dust particles and vehicular emissions are only going to add to the rise in AQI this season,"" he added. The air pollution is not only prevalent outdoors but also indoors. A global study conducted by Dyson in collaboration with Fungicide Resistance Action Committee indicates that houses in Hyderabad had one of the highest percentages for particle size more than 20 um. The dust samples were collected from 27 surfaces in areas such as Attapur, Somajiguda among others. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Flouting norms, contractor's men burning garbage at Ajni Van","Nagpur: A day after TOI reported about a National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) report claiming there was no pollution in the city, workers of the agency's contractor were spotted burning toxic waste openly in the lush green land at Ajni.On Tuesday morning, environment activist Kunal Mourya spotted workers of Nagarjun Construction Company, which has been allotted the contract for constructing inter-modal station at Ajni by NHAI, burning garbage openly at Ajni Van. On Wednesday evening too, Mourya spotted heavy layer of smoke, indicating trash burning.According to activists, this is clear contempt of court. In December 2016, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) imposed a complete ban on burning of waste in open spaces, and announced a fine of Rs 25,000 on each incident. /Taking serious cognizance of air pollution, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court had also prohibited open burning of waste.Flouting all norms, waste items continue to be burnt at Ajni. ""It is not just causing air pollution but is also posing serious threat to nearby trees. Strict action should be taken against the agency,"" said Mourya.Mourya also tweeted about the incident, following which CPCB immediately directed the authorities to take action.It is not clear what work the agency workers were doing at Ajni. Earlier, they were spotted carrying out soil testing survey. ""They have started damaging the lush green property even before the DPR and final plan is ready. The authorities can't start the work before getting an environmental clearance,"" activists said.As reported by TOI, NHAI recently called for tenders to prepare DPR for the project. While IMS is proposed to come up on an area of 44 acres, the total project area, which is spread over four phases, is around 490 acres.A day back, TOI had reported about the lacunae in Environment Assessment Report (EIA) prepared by a private agency for IMS project. The report states that there is no pollution or environmental damage in the city. This at a time the city's air quality has constantly been deteriorating, making it one of the most polluted cities in the country, with open burning of garbage being one of the major causes.

""We have covered all the causes of air pollution - vehicular, industrial, construction, road dust pollution and open air garbage burning - under the plan,"" Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, told TOI.""Plying of electric buses for public transport including establishment of adequate charging stations, maintaining at least 33% forest cover in the city, and launching extensive drives against open burning of biomass, crop residue, garbage and leaves, are some of the measures suggested to bring down air pollution levels in the city,"" he added.Meanwhile, IIT Delhi would also be providing technical support and knowledge to UPPCB in GB Nagar matters of air quality monitoring and pollution control. However, there is no funding for the district till now.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Track the pollution level in your city,Patna's air quality dips to poor category on 'Holika dahan',"PATNA: After being 'moderately clean' before March 28, the city air quality slipped to poor category on Holi because of smoke and fire emanating from 'Holika dahan' the previous day.A study conducted by Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) before, during and after 'Holika dahan' shows that the air pollutants were higher on March 28 and 29 compared to being moderate on Saturday and Tuesday.Air pollution in the city saw a significant increase on Sunday and Monday with PM 2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 micron) rising almost 2.5 times more than the permissible limit of 60 microgram per cubic metre (mpcm). The average PM 2.5 level was recorded at 138.9 mpcm.The air pollutants data was collected through continuous ambient air quality monitoring centres at SK Memorial Hall, Patna City, BIT-Mesra, DRM office Khagaul and Eco Park and two manual centres at Beltron Bhawan and Parivesh Bhawan.As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the overall air quality index (AQI) of Patna was recorded at 187 on March 27, which was under 'moderate' category. The next day, the AQI shot up to 209, bringing the city air quality under 'poor' category while post-'Holika dahan', the AQI value further spiked up to 220.BSPCB public relations officer Birendra Kumar said an ambient air quality study had been conducted for the first time at Patna, Hajipur, Gaya and Muzaffarpur. /""At Hajipur and Muzaffarpur, the pollutant level was normal on the 'Holika dahan'. But the air pollutants at Patna and Gaya were higher that day mainly because of burning of all kinds of waste, including tyres, plastic, tubes and polybags besides firewood,"" he said.Kumar further said that the air pollutants, however, were not alarming because of the awareness drive conducted by the board at several places through 'nukad nataks' and 'sabhas'.On March 27-28, the average PM 2.5 level was recorded at 108.9, while it was 123.7 on March 28-29 despite the less vehicular movement on Patna roads.Kumar said the main reason behind the air pollutant was vehicle emission on March 27-28, but on March 28-29, the major source of air pollutants was burning of waste on 'Holika dahan'.

"Lockdown cut health risk index in Hyd by 17%, cancer risk by 36%: Researchers","Hyderabad: The Covid-19 lockdown helped in the reduction of risk for various diseases, including cancers, for people living in Hyderabad. A research study covering four mega cities in India including Hyderabad has revealed that the overall health risk index of Hyderabad came down by 17% thanks to the restriction on the movement of motor vehicles. Any reduction in the health risk index means good quality air and fewer number of diseases linked to vehicular and industrial pollution. /The cancer risk index for Hyderabad came down by 36.3% during the lockdown period.According to researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad and Patna, and the National Institute of Technology, Warangal, though Hyderabad stood last among four major cities that include Delhi, Bengaluru and Kolkata in terms of reduction in health risk index, it is because Hyderabad is less polluted than the other cities of its size. The study published in the scientific journal, Environmental Research, showed that the maximum reduction in health risk index for Hyderabad was 17% as against 41% for Delhi, 31% for Bengaluru, and 19% for Kolkata. The chronic health index average value in Hyderabad dipped by 36.02% while the acute health index average value for the city came down by 28.36% in 2020 as compared to 2019.The study revealed that transportation is the main source of carbon pollution in Hyderabad with a total urban commuting load of particulate pollution of about 900 kg a day. However, the air pollution load came down considerably during the lockdown.According to researchers, the area around University of Hyderabad benefited the most. This area has high movement of vehicles thanks to IT sector and the outer ring road. The study said air pollution in Hyderabad reduced with a drop of of ""49.82%, 12.95%, and 21.52% in values of photochemical ozone creation potentials (POCP), acidification potential (AP), and eutrophication potential (EP) respectively."" At industrial zone of IDA Pashamylaram station, POCP decreased from 1012 micrograms per cubic metre to 415 micrograms per cubic metre. Acidification potential fell from 56.02 micrograms per cubic metre to 34.11 micrograms per cubic metre. Health risk indices, cancer risk, and chronic health index plunged by 20.22% and 22.25%, study said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Forest fires worsen air pollution, elderly finding it difficult to breathe in smoke-filled hills","Dehradun/Nainital/Uttarkashi/Pithoragarh: The high carbon content in the air due to rampant forest fires in Uttarakhand is turning the pristine hill state into a smoke chamber and beginning to impact the health of the people, especially the elderly, in the affected areas. Many are complaining of low visibility due to smoke while some are complaining of irritation in the eyes and difficulty in breathing.""My mother is 80 years old and she recently got the Covid-19 vaccine. However, the fire and the smoke around us is becoming so toxic that she is now complaining of irritation in the eyes. /The air here has become more polluted than Delhi in winters,"" said Pulak Shukla, a resident of Bhimtal. He added that both the locals and the police are aware of the persons who set fires in forests but no action is being taken.Notably, in the last six months, Uttarakhand has reported over 1,200 forest fire incidents mainly in the hills.The doctors say that the situation is also affecting the 'psychological well-being' of the people as they are fighting a battle against Covid-19 and the deadly smoke simultaneously. Dr Manoj Sharma, chief medical officer (CMO) of Pauri, one of the worst-affected districts, said, ""It is true that besides the usual side effects of pollution, the smoke cover is also leading to psychological issues.""Visibility has also dropped significantly due to the air pollution. ""Our morning walk looks like evening walk as the visibility has reduced from 10,000 metres to just 200 metres here in the hills,"" says 71-year-old Rajmata Devi, a resident of Pithoragarh.Confirming that the smoke is causing myriad health-related issues, Dr HC Pant, chief medical officer (CMO) of Pithoragarh, said, ""There is an increase in the number of patients suffering from irritation in eyes, respiratory issues and uneasiness. The number of patients suffering from dermatology issues has also increased.""The residents of Pauri - where the wildfires have claimed more than 500 hectares of forest cover - are complaining of uneasiness as the sky remains covered with a dense cloud of smoke round the clock.""Children and elderly people in the house are persistently coughing due to the high concentration of poisonous gases in the atmosphere,"" said Sangeeta Devi, a local resident in Pauri.The forest fires have also become a cause of concern for the villagers of Uttarakashi district, where losses to the tune of Rs 5.16 lakh have been recorded due to the blazes.

Next pandemic after Covid will be due to air pollution: Doctors,"Nagpur: The next major pandemic after Covid-19 will be due to air pollution, warn medical experts, highlighting that it kills around seven million people worldwide annually.Senior medical practitioners from Nagpur, Mumbai, Pune and other cities participated in an online convention organized by Mumbai's Waatavaran Foundation on World Health Day on Wednesday. The idea was to discuss impact of air pollution on health and its link with Covid-19.Among several alarming submissions by the medical fraternity, doctors expressed fears that very soon prescriptions issued to patients would be recommending 'access to clean air'. Stating that a majority of people believe the source of problem is outdoors and ignore indoor air pollution, Dr Sundeep Salvi, director of Pulmocare Research and Education, Pune, said, ""It would be a mistake to ignore indoor air pollution. Burning of mosquito coil inside a house causes the same amount of hazardous pollutants as it does when we smoke about 100 cigarettes. An incense stick burnt in house is equivalent to the smoke coming from 500 cigarettes, causing dangerously high pollution levels indoors.""Like Covid-19, air pollution has been observed as a major cause of lung disease, also responsible for affecting the overall immune system. /Explained Dr Sameer Arbat, interventional pulmonologist at KRIMS Hospital, Nagpur, ""Today, the Covid-19 pandemic has gripped the entire world. Although the direct link between air pollution and Covid is not clear yet, it cannot be ignored that the next major pandemic after Covid will be due to air pollution. Therefore, it is important to control this threat.""Air pollution has not spared children too. Dr Aditi Shah, paediatrician at Mumbai's Nanavati Hospital, said infants and children are the worst affected since their lungs are not fully developed. ""If they are constantly exposed to polluted air, they may end up suffering from chronic lung diseases. Polluted air also interferes with the brain development of children and as a result, they can have memory problems.""Adding that there has been rise in incidences of such diseases in the last 10 years, Dr Shah said, ""Cold, flu, and coughs are more common in children. However, in view of the rising air pollution, it is time to prescribe clean and pure air for all as a mandate."" Dr Amita Athavale, professor and head of chest medicine at KEM Hospital, Mumbai, said apart from children, women and the elderly are most exposed to the health hazards associated with indoor air pollution. ""Indoor air pollution is becoming a major cause for concern and we are ignoring it. It needs to be studied and addressed parallelly with outdoor sources,"" she added.Dr Salvi pointed out that one of the main causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in rural areas was use of stoves for cooking. ""It would be wrong to assume that air pollution is caused by only vehicles and industries,"" he said.During the discussion, it was also highlighted that Maharashtra, with highest number (19) of non-attainment cities, is the second largest state in the country after Uttar Pradesh to have seen one lakh deaths due to air pollution between 2017 and 2019.

Six to eight-hour agonising wait for kin at electric crematoriums,"Lucknow: Long queues outside two electric crematoriums -- Baikunth Dham and Gulala Ghat -- in the city can be seen these days due to surge in Covid-19 deaths. As electric cremation is advised in such a case, people have to wait for six to eight hours for their turn to cremate their loved ones.""The two electric crematoriums have two machines each. On an average 30 bodies -- from Lucknow and adjoining districts -- are coming for cremations at the two places. /Since it takes at least two hours to cremate a body with full Covid protocols, there is a long waiting list. So much so that we have to issue tokens to people for their turn,"" said LMC chief engineer RN Tripathi.At Baikunth Dham, Aasha Devi, a resident of Sitapur, had come along with the family to cremate her father who died due to Covid-19 while under treatment in Lucknow. ""We came here around 11 am and got the fifth token number. It is around 3:30 pm now, but we are still waiting. Such a long wait is torturous after days of mental trauma of first seeing our father suffering from Covid and then losing the battle with the disease.""Jeetu, whose elder sister succumbed to the deadly virus, said ""We are waiting for the past three hours and still don't know when my sister's last rites will be performed. My family members have not eaten anything since last night after the casualty. First, you have to wait for a long time to get custody of the body and then for cremation.""Caretaker at Baikunth Dham Munna said, ""About 105 bodies have come for cremation in the past one week. Last rites of 18 were performed on Thursday. Everyone involved in the cremation has to wear a PPE kit and machines have to be sanitised after each funeral.""Greenatorium to be installed soon: The pressure on the two electric crematorium is expected to ease with the start of the 'Greenatorium' in the next few days. It will be the first Greenatorium of the city, said city mayor Sanyukta Bhatia. Two machines for cremations have already been installed in Baikunth Dham. Officials said that the greenatorium used a technology in which cremation is performed in a traditional way without causing air pollution. The machine has a cascade where the body is put on the pyre. After performing last rituals, the pyre is lit up and the chamber is closed. The chamber uses about 150 kg wood to generate enough heat required for burning of the body. The mechanism also has a filtration that prevents emission of toxic gas into the atmosphere. Cost of cremation in Greenatorium is between Rs 300-500. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

The strong smell arising out of rituals saturates the entire atmosphere.""Mishra added that locals fear going near the ghat as infected PPE kits are scattered all over the place. /""Municipal workers and relatives of deceased persons are throwing away medical waste in the open before leaving which is also a major cause of concern,"" he said.Another resident Nawlesh Kumar said, ""My children fell ill due to the prevailing atmosphere and I was forced to shift to my relatives house.""Meanwhile, in a letter to Ranchi deputy commissioner and Ranchi Municipal Corporation another resident Dheeraj Kumar, who is also the treasurer of Advocate Association of Jharkhand high court, said, ""Residents are facing the risk of contracting Covid-19, while toxic medical wastes and the fumes from the pyres are suffocating and causing air pollution."" He also said that rate of infection in Ghagra is growing and several people have succumbed to the disease.He demanded the cremation ground to be shifted elsewhere as the fire is also posing threat to the overhead bridge.Kumar suggested two full electric cremation furnaces to be installed in Ranchi and the number of cremations at Ghagra to be restricted. He stated that more places must be identified for the last rites in the city.Asking the administration to look into the issues, Kumar said, ""The disposal of medical wastes in the open must be stopped.

"Pollution adds to woes, city gasps for breath","Noida: Even as residents are striving to keep themselves protected with double masks to prevent Covid-19 infection, air pollution levels have spiked in parts of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad, adding to breathing problems of many.In Noida Extension, for instance, residents have been waking up to smog every morning for the past two days. A forecast by the weather department has predicted 'poor' air quality in NCR in the next couple of days.""Every morning we wake up and try to go to the balcony to get some fresh air, but the air quality does not permit us. While we are putting on double masks to prevent Covid-19 infection, such poor air is making it worse for our lungs,"" said Manish, a resident of Noida Extension. /On Thursday, all three cities - Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad - reported 'very poor' air quality levels, which according to the Central Pollution Control Board, can 'trigger breathing problems on prolonged exposure'.The AQI of Ghaziabad was recorded at 372, while the Loni AQI station registered 390. Greater Noida's overall AQI was recorded at 318, with Knowledge Park 5 station registering 356. Similarly, Noida's overall AQI was recorded at 319, with Sector 116 showing 335. The Loni air monitoring station in Ghaziabad has reported severe AQI (above 400) both on Wednesday and Tuesday.A weather forecast by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted 'poor' air quality in NCR over the next couple of days, due to inflowing wind from northwest of Delhi loaded with aerosol from crop burning in neighbouring states. The current prevailing wind speed in NCR ranges between 5-15kmph. ""We have been informed by IMD that the smoke visible locally is flowing in from outside. It is a mix of the weather condition with a low wind speed combined with crop burning gases. Overall this is leading to a smog situation,"" said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UPPCB, Ghaziabad.But the Greater Noida UPPCB office says that it is yet to receive a clear explanation for this hyperlocal pollution.""We will investigate this, though wheat has just been harvested in the fields of Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring states and there could be crop burning too. We are usually not affected by smog during this time of the year. However, a low wind speed is also a reason for this sudden dip in AQI as it leads to low pollutant dispersion,"" Sapna Srivastava, regional officer, UPPCB, Greater Noida, said.

"Air quality improves as streets vacant, biz shut in Madhya Pradesh","BHOPAL: Corona curfew has hit the business, but there is no denying the fact that it plays a vital role in breaking the Covid chain. There is another positive to it; it has sharply improved the air quality of the state. Close to a month of lockdown,has brought down the air pollution steeply in all the major cities of Madhya Pradesh.Air quality index of Bhopal on April 12 was 170 that came down to 62 on Wednesday. /Similarly, the air quality index of Indore came down to 88 from 128 in a month.In Gwalior, the air quality index was at 109 that improved, which came down to 72 and in Jabalpur the air quality index came down to 67 from 78 on April 12, as per the central pollution control board data.Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage etc.PM 10 is caused by dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases.Air quality index between 0 and 50 is termed as good with minimal possible health impacts while air quality between 51 and 100 is satisfactory but may lead to minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people. Air quality above 100 is moderate and leads to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases.AQI above 200 leads to breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Officials said the air quality was best during the corona restrictions last year while air pollution sharply went up in major cities this year. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
HC seeks PMC reply on crematorium pollution plea,"Mumbai/Pune: The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday adjourned a petition filed by a Pune resident over concerns of air pollution in the vicinity of crematoriums located within the city.The HC bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni placed the petition on May 19 to enable Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) counsel Abhijit Kulkarni to place its affidavit in reply on record.The public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a man, who said he is a retired civil engineer, stated that there is a 'lot of load on the crematorium situated near SM Joshi Hall, Navi Peth, Pune' and the additional load had been leading to increased pollution in the surrounding environment due to the constant smoke.His counsel Asim Sarode with Ajinkya Udane had sought an urgent order as he sought to submit that some crematoriums in the city were handling 80-100 last rites everyday causing pollution.The court then asked the petitioner what he had been doing for so long.The Central Pollution Control Board had laid down norms for disposal of dead bodies and the HC asked PMC counsel Kulkarni what steps the civic body had undertaken for implementation of the norms put forward by the board. The HC remarked that the crematoriums are sometimes situated in thickly populated residential areas of urban areas.Navi Peth residents want facility to move elsewhere The increased load at Vaikunth crematorium at Navi Peth has raised concerns among those residing in the vicinity. /Residents have demanded that the crematorium be shut down as soon as possible and shifted to a less inhabited area of the city.""The crematorium is a major concern for our health and should be closed down. We have come to know that more cremation facilities are going to be installed at the premises, which will lead to even serious problems for us. We oppose this move,"" said local resident Vikrant Latkar.""Many residents are facing issues due to this facility. Now, the bodies of patients, who have died due to Covid-19, are also cremated here. This is causing even more concern for us,"" said Suresh Naik, another resident.Officials from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said, on an average, 40 bodies were cremated every day at the facility before the pandemic. Since the civic administration has allowed cremation of people, who have died of Covid-19, the number of cremations has increased to 75.""We are taking proper care of the crematorium. Eco-friendly material is being used for cremation of bodies here. Due diligence is done before and after cremation of bodies to avoid pollution,"" said Shrinivas Kandul, a senior official of the PMC.

Neeri develops technology to control air pollution emanating from cremations,"Nagpur: When a human body is burnt, nearly 5kg of dust, along with toxic gases, is released into the atmosphere. To address this major source of air pollution, the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) has developed a technology to mitigate dangerous emissions from open pyre green crematoria.At a time when crematoriums are flooded with bodies due to the on-going Covid-19 pandemic, the technology can prove useful for addressing concerns related to public health. In a pilot experiment, the technology has been successfully implemented at four pyres at Nigam Bodh ghat in New Delhi, where significant emission reduction has been observed. /""Massive piles of firewood are burnt in the open during the cremation process. Apart from particulate matter 10 and 2.5, toxic gases like ozone, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide and other are also released, which are extremely harmful for the human health,"" said chief scientist Padma Rao.Explaining the technology, the scientist said the system comprises of fume collection and handling facility, scrubbing and processing, and utilities and waste handling systems. ""A especially-designed canopy is built on the open pyres followed by a ducting system through which the emissions get captured and passed into the scrubber system. The scrubber has a liquid which reacts and treats the emissions of smoke, oil or grease, greenhouse gases and particulates. There is a specially designed common hood and Induced Draft (ID) for capture and treatment of toxic emissions produced during cremation of bodies. The clean gas flows out of the chimney for safe release of the treated emissions,"" added Rao.The technology also has an effluent treatment plant through which waste liquid can be treated and recycled.Highlighting benefits of the innovation, Rao said, ""If implemented on a large scale, it can potentially reduce the burden of huge emissions at more than 50 open pyre crematoria in New Delhi and other cities. This will lead to massive reduction in exposure of toxic pollutants to humans and improving the air quality. The technology also aids in achieving the country's commitment under Swachh Bharat Mission and sustainable development goals.""Neeri is in talks with some municipal corporations which are willing to adopt this technology. The institute is working towards technology transfer of the innovation.The technology was recently appreciated by Union science and technology minster Dr Harsh Vardhan, who inaugurated the pilot project. The minister stated that the innovation can also be applied to mitigate dispersed air pollution emitted from unorganized and informal industrial sectors. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Human activities to blame for bad air in city: Data,"Nagpur: It is now certain that human activities in the city are responsible for increasing the toxicity in the air we breathe. Air quality monitoring data reveal that like last year, during this lockdown too the air is much cleaner compared to normal days. In the month of April, there was not a single day when levels of major pollutants went above the safe limits.This was revealed by an analysis of data done by environmental group Green Vigil Foundation. It showed compared to the months of January and February, the city's air quality improved significantly in April when lockdown restrictions were increased.The NGO used data from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). While improvement in air quality is evident at various monitoring locations across the city, the organization focused on data of monitoring station at Civil Lines which is sent to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for calculating the city's Air Quality Index (AQI).MPCB monitors three main pollutants - sulphur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM). In January, there were at least six days when the RSPM levels crossed the permissible limit and were over 100. As per CPCB, this range can cause breathing discomfort to people with lung and heart diseases, apart from children and senior citizens.On some days, levels of SO2 and NOx too were more than the safety mark. /The situation was almost the same in the month of February too. However, data for the month of April showed that there was not a single day when levels of all three pollutants went above the safe limit. According to experts, this clearly proved reduction in human activities has a direct impact on air quality. ""In Nagpur, vehicular pollution and emissions from construction activities have been the major contributors of air pollution. During the lockdown period, hardly 30% of the vehicles were plying. Though the government had permitted construction activities, they also reduced by 50-60%. This led to the improvement,"" said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of Green Vigil.As reported by TOI in April last year, scientists at the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) had also stated that overall air quality of the city witnessed dramatic improvement during the nationwide lockdown.Now that the major sources are known, experts feel government should work on curbing pollution caused by them. ""Synchronising traffic signals is crucial to avoid traffic congestions. The more the vehicles wait at junctions, more are the emissions. Also, construction activities, which have drastically increased in the city in last few years, should be time-bound so that emissions are controlled,"" added Chatterjee.Surbhi Jaiswal, team lead at Green Vigil, said the civic body should also focus on saving the green cover. ""In all these years, there has not been a single strict punishment against illegal felling of trees. We all know that trees play a major role in controlling air pollution. Even when giving permissions to fell trees, the civic officials should try and find a middle way that can save maximum number of trees possible,"" she said.GROUND REALITY- Like last year, this time too drastic improvement in city's air quality during lockdown- Air quality in April improved compared to January and February- RSPM, NOx and SO2 parameters within permissible limit- Vehicles and construction activities major sources of air pollution- Synchronisation of traffic signals and time-bound construction needed For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Gujarat's green solution to tackle smoke pollution,"Vadodara: Delhiites may soon enjoy 'clear' wintry mornings without choking on smoggy air caused by rampant burning of stubble in farms across Punjab and Haryana. A Gujarat-based biotech firm has come up with 'multi-microbial consortia' that will not only put a lid on the environmental mess, but also improve the soil quality as a bonus. Headed by Padma Shri Dr M H Mehta, Gujarat Life Sciences Ltd (GLSL) also recently bagged a national award for 'Leadership Role in Post-Harvest Stubble Burning Solution' for its innovation. /""We had been working on solving the stubble burning problem in the northern states for many years. GLSL did research and development to come up with a solution - Relife - that can put an end to this air polluting menace that is also causing political problems between Delhi, Punjab and Haryana governments. We managed to make microbial consortia about three years ago and then approached the Punjab government,"" Mehta, a scientist and GLSL chairman, told TOI.""The Punjab government roped in the Punjab Pollution Control Board and a few NGOs and farmers' bodies to convince the tillers to use microbial consortia. Relife is being used on about 400 acres of land and the results have been very encouraging. Within a couple of years, we expect that about few lakh acres of land in Punjab will be covered by microbial consortia,"" Mehta, former vice-chancellor of Gujarat Agricultural University, said. He added that farmers in Haryana too are using Relife. All that the farmers have to do is mix Relife with water and spray on the stubble. The microbial consortia converts the stubble into bio-compost that dissolves in the soil during ploughing.""In India, rice, wheat, sugarcane and cotton are prone to maximum crop residue. Stubble burning is often blamed not only for air pollution but also deteriorating soil fertility. It is also a major source of greenhouse gases. If the state governments adopt microbial consortia, this problem can be dealt with effectively,"" Mehta added. GLSL, a biotechnology firm based in Vadodara, was established in 2000 with an aim to develop agro products that eco-friendly, cost effective and organic. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Experts, activists urge people not to consume tobacco products","BHUBANESWAR: On the eve of World No Tobacco Day, experts and anti-tobacco activists on Sunday appealed to people of the state not to consume tobacco products which are unhealthy for the body in the long run. It can cause many types of cancer.Lalatendu Sarangi, director of the Acharya Harihar Post Graduate Institute of Cancer (AHPGIC) Cuttack, said tobacco products are the major contributor of cancer and other lifestyle diseases in the state. ""If you stop consuming tobacco products, you can prevent 50 per cent of cancer diseases. /So prevention is better than cure,"" he added.He said people will get oral cancer and lung cancer if they smoke tobacco. If anybody chews tobacco, he/she may get oral cancer and esophageal cancer. Tobacco affects every organ in one form or another, he added. ""Previously, people were developing cancer after chewing tobacco for 10 or 15 years, but now I find the pouch containing tobacco products creates serious danger for the younger generation who gets cancer after consuming smokeless tobacco for four to six years. It is high time we should stop it at source,"" said Sarangi. The state government has imposed a ban on the manufacture, storage, sale and distribution of gutkha and panmasala containing tobacco or nicotine as ingredients since January 3, 2013. The then health minister had assured that the government will implement the regulations with all sincerity, but it remains on paper only.Activists alleged that many shops do not obey the ban order of the state government and sell these gutkha and panmasala products containing tobacco. They demanded strong actions against sellers and manufacturers of these banned products. Mostly Pan shops and ration shops sell these items without fear and question, they added.Padma Charan Nayak, noted prohibitionist and anti-tobacco campaigner, said the state government should implement its ban order in letter and spirit. Police should conduct raids and impose fines on the manufacturers and sellers across the state. ""Public should refrain from consuming these tobacco products for their own health benefit,"" he added. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2013 had classified air pollution like tobacco products as the cause of cancer. Global Adult Tobacco Survey's Odisha Fact Sheet 2016-17, released in January, 2018 revealed that 42.9 per cent of the population in Odisha chew tobacco and their number is double the national average of 21.4 per cent. The survey, conducted jointly by the Union health ministry and the WHO, said 8.6 per cent of the people in the state used betel with tobacco, 16.9 per cent used khaini, 9.4 per cent used gutkha and 8.6 per cent consumed paan masala with tobacco.

Govt seeks closure of 10 thermal power plants in SC petition,"New Delhi: Delhi government has filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking closure of the ten thermal power plants situated in the vicinity of Delhi that have been using old/outdated polluting technology. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said that 10 coal-fired thermal power plants in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were contributing significantly to the air pollution in Delhi-NCR. Rai said the government had been taking several steps to improve the air quality of Delhi under the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal. /""We have been writing to the government of India and requesting their cooperation regarding pollution from thermal plants. However, no action has been taken against these thermal plants, and instead, they are being allowed to pollute with total disregard for the health of citizens. We hope that the Supreme Court will take the necessary steps and direct closure of these plants on an urgent basis,"" he added.The Union ministry of power had revised the timeline given to these thermal plants for compliance to December 2019 as against the earlier deadline of 2018. ""However, the CPCB arbitrarily extended the deadline for compliance with the emission norms beyond December 2019 to 2022. Further, according to the new notification, non-compliance by these power plants will not lead to the closure of the polluting units but they would continue to pollute subject to the payment of a mere penalty amount,"" said Rai.The environment minister said various studies had highlighted the effects of the pollutants from such coal-fired power plants on the health of communities. The ill-effects are more pronounced for vulnerable individuals, children, pregnant women, the elderly, and persons suffering from asthma and lung diseases. He also quoted a 2018 study by TERI, which stated that 60% of the PM 2.5 in Delhi originates from sources outside Delhi.The ten thermal power plants are-Dadri NCTPP and Harduaganj TPS in UP; GH TPS (Lehra Mohabbat), Nabha TPP, Ropar TPS and Talwandi Sabo TPP in Punjab; and Yamunanagar TPS, Indira Gandhi STPP, Panipat TPS and Rajiv Gandhi TPS in Haryana.

Tree cutting is injurious to health,"In school, we were taught the critical importance of trees for the physical and mental health of everyone. Climate scientists taught us that trees should not be destroyed for the sake of development as they can solve some of the world's thorniest problems. Why is it then that our policymakers are continuously underestimating the power of trees and treating them as disposable? Trees transplanted for the sake of 'modernization' are not growing any faster but definitely dying younger. On World Environment Day, top doctors of the city remind 'those in power to save lives' how killing thousands of age-old trees at Ajni will eventually lead to severe respiratory ailments, mental health disorders and various other health issues. /Ironically, the policymakers who are manufacturing and buying artificial oxygen in this pandemic are mass killing natural oxygen generators with disdainNagpur: While the government plans to go ahead with its ambitious project of building an inter-modal station (IMS) at Ajni, top doctors in the city have come forward to warn that such large-scale destruction of green cover will be a death knell for public health.As is being reported by TOI, thousands of age-old trees planted during the British era are facing axe for the IMS project. For phase-1, over 5,000 trees will be chopped off. The lush green area, one of the few remaining green patches in the city, is a thriving biodiversity habitat.According to medical experts, such kind of deforestation will lead to health-endangering pollution in the city. Interventional pulmonologist Dr Sameer Arbat says, ""Trees have the ability to take in carbon dioxide and generate oxygen, fairly opposite to what the human body does. The presence of trees gives us the advantage of having more oxygen in our surroundings. Also, when it comes to particulate matter, the presence of trees leads to accumulation of dust around them and they act like air-filters, thus controlling air pollution.""The recent Covid-19 pandemic has exposed a lot of chinks in our armour when it comes to development and growth, the doctor adds. ""India as a country talks about development in terms of road transport, communications sector, economic growth etc but where we failed miserably was healthcare. The fact that the entire country was gasping for oxygen shows our apathy towards basic resources. This was a wake-up call on the importance of oxygen. Since we are short on artificial sources of oxygen, cutting down the natural sources is nothing but a big joke,"" says Dr Arbat.Pulmonologist and director of Respira Chest and Critical Care Hospital, Dr Vikrant Deshmukh, warns that cutting thousands of trees at Ajni will affect the air quality and will lead to a rise in lung-related problems. ""The number of trees that needs to be sacrificed is huge. Rather than unilateral planning, policymakers need to involve citizens and environmental groups,"" he says.Chopping off an urban forest will lead to an exponential rise in various non-communicable diseases, says Dr Jerryl Banait. ""Ailments like hypertension, diabetes, asthma and other pulmonary diseases have been on a drastic rise. This is due to changes in lifestyle, which is directly linked with environmental degradation. Pulmonary infections are on the higher side at places having less green cover as the air pollution levels are high,"" explains the young doctor who is also an environment activist.Apart from respiratory issues, cutting trees at Ajni may lead to other health problems too. Dr Banait further says, ""It will cause a decline in groundwater table which will further bring up diseases like fluorosis. Also, trees are biodiversity in itself as they are home to not just birds and insects but also microbes. These microorganisms feed on the dead flesh. If trees are cut, the microbes will stop functioning which will be a starting point for severe diseases.""For Dr Anup Marar, convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA), it was catastrophic to hear about the forthcoming mass removal of ""over 30,000 lungs and kidneys of our city"". Calling it a sheer carnage, Dr Marar says, ""Trees are recognized as lungs because they exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with the atmosphere. But, trees are also kidneys as they regulate the flow and use of water by intercepting rain and releasing it slowly to the ground, which is then absorbed by plants for use in photosynthesis.""Dr Marar adds that it is ironical of policymakers to buy artificial oxygen concentrators and promote bulk construction of oxygen plants but gleefully join hands for this mass killing of the biggest natural source of oxygen.Just like doctors, the policymakers should weigh risk and benefits of a project before coming to any decision, suggests consultant pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnakar. Recently, Dr Swarnakar, who heads Get Well Hospital, had appealed to all the Covid-19 recovered patients to plant 10 trees to give the oxygen back to nature. ""A least now we should realize the importance of oxygen. Bringing up this project in Ajni will lead to major air and sound pollution. Is the project need-based? It is a big threat to age-old greenery and the planning authorities need to consider this,"" adds the secretary of the Indian Chest Society.In the opinion of Dr Sushrut Babhulkar, director of Sushrut Hospital, trees more than 75 years should be declared as national heritage and permission to cut or translocate them shouldn't be given. ""Cutting these trees will adversely affect the senior citizens whose lung capacity has naturally reduced with age. Due to lack of fresh air there is bound to be a steep increase in respiratory disorder,"" he says.Highlighting the public health benefits, Dr Babhulkar says, ""Approximately, 7-8 trees produce oxygen required for one person. Trees like Banyan and Neem give large amount of oxygen due to their vast foliage. Development projects should be planned in a manner so as to cut minimal trees as possible.""Not just respiratory problems, air pollution also has effects on the brain. ""The Global Burden of Disease study, carried out by an international team using data from 188 countries, found that up to 30% of the stroke cases in the world are due to pollutants in the air. In addition to stroke, initial findings suggest it could play a role in autism, attention deficit disorders and memory impairment in children, dementia and the development of Parkinson's disease in adults,"" says Dr Chandrashekhar Meshram, President of Tropical Neurology and member of Environmental Neurology group of World federation of neurology. DOCTORS' VOICES* Large-scale destruction of green cover at Ajni is a big threat for public health* Trees act as air purifiers, chopping them will increase air pollution* This will lead to respiratory ailments, mental health problems* Can also have effects on brain and cause strokes, autism, attention deficit disorders, dementia and memory impairment in children* Non-communicable diseases like diabetes, asthma, hypertension etc might also rise* Learn lessons from the pandemic, value resources of natural oxygen For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Impact of forest fires? In March & April, Dehradun was as polluted as Delhi, recorded poor AQI levels","Dehradun: The spate of forest fires earlier this year may have caused Dehradun's air quality to plummet to 'poor category' with air quality index (AQI) levels hovering between 201 and 300 for two straight months - March, when the AQI was 237, and April, when it was 225. This put Dehradun in the same category as Delhi, where the AQI hovered between 190 to 250, putting the air quality in the 'moderate to poor' category during March and April.""In all likelihood, the pollution rise in Dehradun in these two months can be related to the forest fires with other factors like construction works and vehicular pollution also contributing,"" said SP Subudhi, member secretary, state pollution control board. Rishikesh, which neighbours Dehradun, also witnessed poor AQI of 221 during March although in April, the AQI level in the town had become moderate (194).Incidentally, the Covid curfew seems to have had little impact on the environment of Uttarakhand this time, unlike previous year's lockdown, when the air quality in March and April remained in 'moderate and satisfactory categories' with AQI levels between 51 and 200 across the state. This, according to Subudhi, may be because Covid curfew was announced only towards the end of April this year whereas lockdown was imposed in the state soon after Holi in March last year.The period between March and May this year saw a brutal second wave of Covid with affected persons reporting breathing distress and impaired lung functions. /Whether air pollution also had a role to play in aggravating the symptoms is something experts are not sure of, although poor AQI levels, as per Central Pollution Control Board indicators, does lead to ""breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure."" That forest fires will have a detrimental effect on air quality was a fear being expressed by environmentalists even when the state's jungles were blazing. In March, the state lost 868.4 hectares of its forest cover to 627 fire incidents whereas April saw 1807 fire incidents and lost 2418.65 hectares of forest cover.The intensity of forest fires this year could be gauged by the fact that in April, IAF choppers called from Bareilly for fire-fighting in Kumaon could not take off because the smoke from the fires was extremely dense. Locals in many areas in the hills had also complained about the severity of forest fires this year, with some terming their areas as having turned into 'smoke chambers'.TOI had reported in early April that the high carbon content in the air due to rampant forest fires was beginning to impact the health of the people, especially the elderly, with many complaining of low visibility due to smoke while some were complaining of irritation in the eyes and difficulty in breathing.

Why Winter Measures Aren't Enough To Clean Up Delhi Air,"New Delhi: While the country had seen a drop in pollution levels last summer, following the complete lockdown as blue skies dominated the news, data from major cities this year showed despite the partial lockdown in place, pollution levels remained above Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and World Health Organisation (WHO) standards in a number of key locations.The analysis compiled by air pollution experts through the NCAP tracker found the top 10 most polluted locations across the country had an average PM 2.5 level reading between 99 and 120 micrograms per cubic metre. During summers, dust also plays a key role, pushing PM 10 readings up.NCAP tracker data showed out of the 10 most polluted locations across the country, five of these were in Delhi, including Bawana, Mundka, CRRI Mathura road, ITO and NSIT Dwarka. The most polluted location was found to be the RIICO Industrial area in Bhiwadi, Rajasthan, with an average PM 2.5 concentration of 120 micrograms per cubic metre from March till May, followed by Sector 62 in Noida, with an average concentration of 113 micrograms per cubic metre. /Bawana in north Delhi was the third, at an average reading of 109 micrograms per cubic metre, data showed.NCAP tracker, a comprehensive review of India's national clean air programme implementation and impact, was developed by CarbonCopy and Respirer Living Sciences to analyse air pollution data through the year.Experts and health professionals said the data highlighted that knee jerk reactions should be avoided during peak winter pollution months and instead action was needed throughout the year. ""Air pollution isn't a seasonal problem and hence mitigation requires long-term planning, which is missing even in the current clean air action plans for non-attainment cities. It is important to prioritise the problems, identify timelines and resources and set accountability. Everyone discusses high pollution levels during the winters and focuses on emissions from crop burning, but we need to look at prioritising and reducing emissions from transport, industry and so many other sources as well,"" said Dr Sagnik Dey, coordinator of Centre of Excellence for Research on Clean Air (CERCA) at IIT Delhi.Dey said while in 2020, during the Covid-19 lockdown, pollution levels were at an all-time low, these were still three times the WHO annual safe limit of 10 micrograms per cubic metre.NCAP data from January till June, meanwhile, showed Ghaziabad to be the most polluted city, followed by Bhiwadi, Greater Noida and Baghpat. Delhi was ninth on this list.""Like in the winter months, air pollution will have similar effects on one's health even in summers. High pollution levels may lead to increased instances of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergies, bronchial asthma, etc. The nature of the pollutants may have an impact and is something that must be studied by health professionals,"" said Dr Arun Sharma, president, Society for Indoor Environment.

Air quality near crematorium to be assessed,"Pune: The civic body has planned a third-party assessment of air quality near the Vaikunth crematorium.For this purpose, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has engaged the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI).The civic administration planned the assessment following complaints of poor air quality by residents, who claimed that cremation of bodies - including those of Covid-19 victims - was causing air pollution in the vicinity.The presence of carbon particles and other pollutants has increased in the vicinity of the crematorium, residents claimed. ""The assessment will be completed in the next six months. /It will check if cremations are causing or intensifying air pollution,"" Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee, said. The committee approved a proposal regarding the assessment on Tuesday.The facility has three electrical crematoriums, one gas crematorium and six stands for wood pyres. PMC has set up separate blowers and scrubbers to prevent pollution. The smoke is discharged through a chimney that is 30 metres tall. PMC has installed sensors for air quality monitoring near Vaikunth.PMC limits have 24 cremation facilities, including electric and gas-operated crematoriums.As per civic administration data, around 10 to 15 Covid deaths were recorded per day. The number of deaths went up 80 during the peak periods of the pandemic. Per day, around 300 bodies were cremated across the civic limits, officials said.Among other decisions, the standing committee took the call to scrap the revenue committee constituted under the chairmanship of municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar. The standing committee approved Rs 6.71 crore for a city library and study room for students preparing for competitive exams. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'10-unit rise in PM 2.5 causes 7 hospital admissions in Delhi each week',"NEW DELHI: A 10-unit increase in PM 2.5 leads to more than seven hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases in Delhi each week, said a study conducted by Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC)./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/The report of the15-month study, which started in April 2019 to assess the impact of air pollution on health, was submitted to Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) around three months ago, an official said. MAMC was asked by DPCC to conduct the study.A team led by Dr Nandini Sharma, former dean and the head of department of community medicine, MAMC, collected data from Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Lok Nayak, Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Guru Teg Bahadur, Lal Bahadur Shastri and Madan Mohan Malviya hospitals.According to the report, the rate and trend of the cardio-respiratory morbidity in terms of hospital admissions were corroborated with the change in values of Air Quality Index (AQI), PM10 and PM2.5 levels. It showed that ""an increase of 10 units of PM 2.5 leads to 7.09 new cumulative respiratory admissions per week, keeping other factors constant"". ""The increase in respiratory admissions (bronchitis, bronchial asthma) is directly proportional to increase in AQI,"" the report read.The study has been able to generate evidence that cardiopulmonary admissions in hospitals increase significantly with rising air pollution. ""An increase of 10 units of PM2.5 will increase 1.1 new cumulative cardiac admissions in these hospitals each week,"" it said.The team also collected community-based data on the restriction of activity, perceived stress, awareness about the cause and perceived interventions required for improving air quality from1,879 people in all11 districts of Delhi.

Track the pollution level in your city,"Post unlock, air pollution surges in MP","Bhopal: Corona curfew not only breaks the Covid chain, but also helps in improving the air quality. Around 50 days of lockdown between April and June had brought down the air pollution substantially in major Madhya Pradesh cities. But after unlock, the pollution levels have again started rising in most of the cities across the state. /Air quality index of Bhopal on May 30 was 77 that rose to 98 on July 8. In Indore, AQI was 73 on May 30, which went up to 101. In Gwalior, AQI was 53 on May 30 which rose to 84 on July 8 while in Jabalpur AQI was 80 on May 30, which hovered around 76 on July 8.Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, the increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage, among others.PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases.Air quality index between 0 and 50 is termed as good with minimal possible health impacts while air quality between 51 and 100 is satisfactory but may lead to minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people. Air quality above 100 is moderate and leads to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases.AQI above 200 leads to breathing discomfort for most of the people on prolonged exposure. Officials said the air quality remained best during the corona restrictions.From April 8, the government announced weekend lockdowns in city limits across the state due to a surge in Covid-19 cases.

Stroke caused 7 lakh deaths in India in 2019: Study,"NEW DELHI: The share of non-communicable and injury-related neurological disorders such as stroke, headache disorders, and epilepsy to the total disease burden has more than doubled -from 4% to 8.2% - in India between 1990 to 2019, whereas the contribution of communicable neurological disorders reduced during this period by threequarters, a new scientific paper published in the Lancet Global Health shows.The paper highlighted aging as one of the main factors behind increasing burden of non-communicable neurological disorders. The paper is a collaborative effort between the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and a number of other organisations.Stroke (37.9%), headache disorders (17.5%), and epilepsy (11.3%) are the leading contributors to neurological disorders burden in India, with stroke having caused 6,99,000 deaths in India in 2019, which was 7.4% of the total deaths in the country. Stroke also caused 68% of deaths due to neurological disorders, followed by Alzheimer's and other dementias (12%), and encephalitis (5%).The total burden of neurological disorders due to noncommunicable disorders is 82.8%; 11.2% is due to communicable and 6% is injury-related disorders, the paper says. /The paper underlined high blood pressure, air pollution, dietary risks, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index as the leading contributors to neurological disorders.""The rise of non-communicable disease related risk factors, as leading contributors to neurological disorders and resultant disability in India, is not a surprise. It reflects the demographics, socio-economic and nutrition transitions that have steered the shift in our epidemiological profile over the past 30 years,"" PHFI president K Srinath Reddy said. While communicable diseases contributed to the majority of total neurological disorders burden in children below 5 years age, non-communicable neurological disorders were the highest contributor in all other age groups.Communicable neurological disorders include encephalitis, meningitis, and tetanus, whereas injury-related neurological disorders include traumatic brain injuries and spinal cord injuries.

"Bandhwari landfill fire: Serious lapses by Haryana government, says NGT","Gurgaon: There appear to be ""serious lapses"" and continuing failure on the part of the Haryana authorities to provide a clean environment and uphold the rule of law, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has said days after the Bandhwari landfill site caught fire.These remarks were made by a bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel while hearing a plea alleging failure to maintain environmental norms in handling the Bandhwari landfill site on Monday. The tribunal also constituted a three-member committee to submit a report within a month on the causes of fire, reasons for unauthorised persons working at the landfill site, progress on remediation of the site and setting up of the waste processing plant.The committee comprises an official each from the Central Pollution Control Board and Haryana State Pollution Control Board and Gurgaon's district magistrate.""We are of the view that effective remedial measures, including an effective monitoring mechanism, is required in view of the seriousness of the situation. A state can hardly be oblivious to its constitutional obligation to the citizens for protection of public health, particularly when failure to prevent outbreak of diseases results in mass destruction of human lives. /No enemy is needed. Failure of the administration and neglect of responsibility is enough for destruction,"" the bench said.Moreover, the tribunal has also said the errant officers have to be made accountable for the continuous failure in handling the landfill site. After the three-member panel submits its report, the Haryana chief secretary will have to respond about the remedial action taken and steps taken against the errant officers within a month.After the landfill caught fire on July 11, MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja had directed the officials concerned to submit a report on the causes of fire. ""I have not received the report yet. I will be able to decide the further course of action after receiving the report,"" he said.Sanjay Sharma, deputy CEO of Ecogreen, the concessionaire of solid waste management in Gurgaon, said: ""We have already initiated an inquiry to investigate the cause of fire at the landfill site. As soon as the report is filed, we will submit it to MCG. The corporation is also conducting an inquiry at its level.""According to petitioner Poonam Yadav, waste is being burnt at Bandhwari, causing air pollution. It has the potential to affect not only locals but also the flora and fauna at Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, the plea says. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Experts suggest ways to check pollution,"Pune: A team of experts from National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) have suggested that another scrubber be added in the chimney at the Vaikunth crematorium for enhanced filtration of smoke. The team members have also suggested other improvements in operational practices.The team visited the Vaikunth crematorium to check the pollution levels following complaints from residents. /Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials said the experts' suggestions include training staff operating electric crematoriums and improving the way in which the bodies are handled.The chimney already has a couple of scrubbers. With the addition of another scrubber, the smoke coming out can be better filtered. The issues of location and height can be sorted out up to a large extent with the additional scrubber, experts claimed.""The team's suggestions will be implemented. The experts have also given suggestions to control the smoke and improve the standard operating procedures,"" said Shrinivas Kandul, a senior PMC official.The civic body has installed sensors to check the air quality at residential and commercial establishments located around Vaikunth. The presence of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur particles will be checked. The air quality of the area will be compared with other neighbourhoods in the city, to see if locations around the crematorium are more polluted.The team of experts has also installed temporary sensors to monitor air pollution in real time for their study. There are 24 electrical- and gas-operated cremation facilities within PMC limits. Civic officials claimed that they are using eco-friendly methods, like the use of white coal, to cremate bodies.

"High level of metals, PM 2.5 found in Chennai's air","CHENNAI: Air quality across the city is consistently poor with high levels of particulate matter, a study released by a Chennai based environment and health advocacy group on Monday said. More worrying is the detection of high levels of silica, manganese and nickel, which can cause neurological disorders, cancer and respiratory disorders.The samples were taken by Healthy Energy Initiative India, a team of public health experts, and Coastal Resource Centre, which works on environmental issues, in February and March from across the city, mostly from near industrial areas in north Chennai, and sent for testing to Chester Labnet in Oregon, US. The group has released similar studies once a year since 2016.The study shows 17 of the 20 samples had levels of Particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5) higher than the 24-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 60 micro gram per cubic metre by 1.1 to 3.8 times. /The highest values of PM2.5 were reported in samples taken from Tirusulam, Vyasarpadi and Parry's.As far as other pollutants were concerned, a benchmark for their acceptable levels in air has not yet been set by India, necessitating comparison with international standards.Similarly, 19 of the 20 samples reported silica levels higher than the limit set by California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), a US government body. The OEHHA recommends annual average exposure of 3 micro gram per cubic metre. Tirusulam reported the highest value. Silica is present in coal ash and construction sand and acute exposure causes silicosis, a lung disease.Twelve of 20 samples reported manganese levels exceeding the US's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reference concentration of 0.05 micro gm/ cubic metre. Two samples even had higher values of manganese, a neurotoxin, than recommended by the WHO's annual health based guidelines of 0.15 micro gm per cubic metre.Levels of nickel, a carcinogen which affects respiratory and immune response in the body, in 19 of 20 samples exceeded the WHO annual health guideline value of 0.0025 micro gm per cubic metre, the report said.The samples were taken from rooftops of residential homes, a child care centre's roof, a temple roof and from commercial buildings.Vishvaja Sambath, one of the three researchers who worked on the project, said they were collating data to document the presence of these metals in Chennai's ambient air. ""Studies have shown those with respiratory ailments are more vulnerable to Covid-19. Greater Chennai Corporation should take action to ensure cleaner air,"" she said.G Sundarrajan of Poovulagin Nanbargal, an environmental organisation, said lung diseases caused by such pollutants affects economic activity of people. ""TNPCB should improve its air monitoring systems,"" he said.The corporation is chalking out plans to work on the air pollution issues in industrialised north Chennai, an official said.
