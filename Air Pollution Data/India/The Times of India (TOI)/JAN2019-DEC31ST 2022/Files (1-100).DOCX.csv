Telangana pride flew high and how!,"The end of 2018 is here, and before it does, here's a final thought: What a bombaat year it was for Telangana! For the uninitiated, bombaat is Telangana slang for spectacular, and perfectly sums up the go-getting spirit of India's youngest state and it's trailblazing youth icons who made the world sit up and take notice of our path-breaking achievements. Here's to 2018!Bathukamma and Bonalu found a place in the Oxford dictionaryTelangana's state festivals, Bathukamma and Bonalu garnered worldwide attention as they debuted in the English dictionary, quite literally. It was a matter of pride for the whole state as Bathukamma and Bonalu festivals found a mention in the Oxford English Dictionary. /And what's more, this year, Bathukamma celebrations scaled a new high as four bikernis made history by playing Bathukamma up in the air. Hyderabadi girl pipped Rohit, Virat to set new T20 record She is the poster girl of Indian women's cricket and boy, did she have a fabulous year! Mithali Raj added another feather to her hat by becoming India's highest run-getter in the T20 format, surpassing Rohit Sharma and Indian men's cricket skipper Virat Kohli. The Hyderabadi girl achieved the feat on November 15 when she scored an elegant 51 against Ireland. With 2283 runs in 85 matches at an average of 37.43, the 35-year-old is also the first women to score the most number of half centuries in the T20 format in the year. In June, during the T20 Asia Cup, Mithali became the first Indian to breach the 2000 run mark in the shorter format of the game. Need we say more!Make way for India's highest-paid female athlete!This year has been phenomenal for badminton ace PV Sindhu. The Hyderabadi may have fallen seven positions from 13th in 2017 to 20th in the 2018 Forbes India Celebrity 100 list, but the 23-year-old's medal tally across tournaments grew remarkably in 2018. The Olympic silver medalist not only bagged a gold and silver in the mixed team and women's singles event in the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia but also made history to become the first Indian woman to win the season-ending BWF World Tour Finals tournament in China. The current World No. 3 also bagged a silver in Asian Games 2018 and with an earning of USD 8.5 million, became the 7th and only Indian female athlete to be in the august company of 10 highest-paid female athletes in the world.Hyderabad ranked best city to live in India For the fourth continuous year, Hyderabad was ranked the best city in India, in the Mercer's Quality of Living rankings 2018. Hyderabad ranked 142 in the list of all the countries in the world, sharing a spot with Pune. The relatively low crime rate and pleasant weather conditions have helped it hold on to its top rank among Indian cities in the survey. A separate ranking on sanitation, which analysed cities' waste removal and sewage infrastructure, levels of infectious disease, air pollution, water availability and quality - all important aspects of a city's attractiveness for both talent and businesses, was also introduced this year. In this list, Hyderabad was ranked at 209 in the world. Guess there is always scope to improve.Telangana's first Sangeet Natak Akademi awardeeKuchipudi danseuse Deepika Reddy made Telangana proud with her Sangeet Natak Akademi award win earlier this year. It was a fitting honour for her dedicated efforts to make Kuchipudi relevant to the younger generation by discussing social and women centric issues through her productions.Telangana's first transwoman to contest in assembly electionsIt was the first ever time that a transwoman from Telangana got a ticket from a party to contest in a legislative assembly election. Muvva Chandramukhi, representing the Goshamahal constituency as a member of the Bahujan Left Front, was nothing short of an inspiration and epitome of hope to her fellow LGBTQI+ counterparts in the State by taking the political plunge. Despite losing out to BJP's Raja Singh, her desire to be a change maker in the society was well appreciated.Hyderabad boy who made a splash in HollywoodIndian-American filmmaker Aneesh Chaganty, who is originally from Hyderabad, made waves internationally with his debut film Searching. The Hollywood thriller enjoyed both critical acclaim and commercial success, and created quite a buzz at the Sundance Film Festival. In India too, Searching went on to become a huge success and Telugu boy Chaganty won a whole new set of fans. First Telangana man to win royal fellowshipOne of the finest photographers of Telangana, Kusuma Prabhakar made the state proud when he bagged one of the most coveted fellowships in the field of the photography - Fellow of The Royal Photographic Society (FRPS) of Great Britain. Prabhakar became only the second photographer from the Telugu states to be awarded the fellowship, 31 years after the legendary Late Bandi Ranjan Babu. The native of Warangal was conferred the prestigious fellowship for a set of 20 black-and-white photographs that he shot 24 years ago at the Mother Teresa Destitute Home in Warangal. Prabhakar, who gave an interview to Hyderabad Times before he passed away due to a cardiac arrest on November 22, said, ""I wasn't awarded this honour for some routine photographs that everyone clicks in Ladakh, Jaisalmer or at Kumbh Mela, showing camels and chillum-smoking babas. My pictures show emotions, be it of living beings or objects. Everyone can click a photograph these days, but only a few can show emotion in it.""T'wood stars raked in the moolah like never beforeIn a first, as many as 11 Telugu celebrities featured in the coveted 2018 Forbes India Celebrity 100 List. While badminton powerhouse PV Sindhu topped the list among mana celebs at 20th position with earnings of `36.6 crore, Power Star Pawan Kalyan sat pretty at 24th spot with `31.33 crore. The others who made it to the coveted list included NTR on 28th, Mahesh Babu on 33rd, Nagarjuna on 36th, Koratala Siva on 39th followed by others.

5 new sensors to monitor air quality,"PATNA: The air quality index (AQI) at Muzaffarpur was the worst in the country at 477 on Friday, followed by Patna at 452. The air quality in both cities were under ""severe"" category, which can affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases.But, the PM2.5 (suspended particulate matter less than 2.5 microns) concentration in Patna remained the highest in the country for the third consecutive day with the maximum recorded in Kankarbagh at 717 micrograms per cubic meter (?g/m3), followed by Mithapur (535), Phulwarisharif (508) and Boring Road (444) areas. The findings were based on the monitoring of air quality by sensors installed at different places in Patna by Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), in association with the Centre for Environment, Energy and Climate Change (CEECC) at ADRI.The sensors have been installed in Boring Road, IGSC planetarium, Phulwarisharif, Kankarbagh and Mithapur areas to measure PM1, PM2.5 and PM10, in addition to temperature and humidity in the air of the particular location.BSPCB officials said the air quality assessment in Patna was being done so far only by the monitoring station at planetarium, which was not enough to give a holistic picture of the pollution level in the city.""Since the planetarium is located in the heart of the city, the vehicular density there is also quite high, which escalates the PM2.5 figures. /This further translates into higher level of AQI. In order to make a wider assessment of city air quality, we have installed five small-intensity pollution monitoring sensors at different locations and they are functioning,"" BSPCB chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh told TOI.The findings of the sensors oscillates between 'very poor' to 'severe' at all times in a day. However, the air pollution remains under 'very poor zone' during noon (2-5pm) at Boring Road, Phulwarisharif, Kankarbagh and Mithapur. The pollution level escalates during 5-10pm.CEECC experts said high level of air pollution can lead up to 15% increase in household budget. ""The neighbourhood monitoring clearly depicts that traffic congestion leading to higher emission of black carbon during the peak hours, open littering of garbage, along with road dust and biomass burnings are major sources of air pollution in the city. Most of the vehicles plying in Patna are more than 15 years old. The other unique feature is the fuel used in the commercial eateries are coal and other biomass, which substantially contribute to the PM level in the city,"" said Abinash Mohanty, director-cum-ENVIS-coordinator at CEECC.

'Higher air pollution levels linked to Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis',"Jaipur: Rising level of air pollution is proving to be increasingly hazardous to the lungs. Toxic gases emitted by vehicles and sources of indoor and outdoor pollution are making people more susceptible to Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP), which is an interstitial lung disease (ILD). The odds of developing HP were 7% greater for every 10 g/m3 increase in the air pollution (PM2.5 level), shows a study spearheaded by a Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital doctor, which was presented at Rajpulmocon 2019 in the city on Saturday.""Higher proportion of patients diagnosed with HP lived in cities with higher levels of air pollutants,"" says the national-level study, 'Hypersensitivity pneumonitis and its correlation with ambient air pollution in urban India', which has been accepted for getting published in the European respiratory journal. Out of the 842 patients included in the study, 202 belonged to Jaipur. In Jaipur, the percentage of ILD cases diagnosed with HP was more than 48%, which indicates that higher pollution levels in the city is making people more susceptible to HP. /ILD is an umbrella term for a large group of disorders that cause scarring (fibrosis) of the lungs. Dr Sheetu Singh, assistant professor (Institute of respiratory disease), SMS Medical College, presented her study on association of ambient air pollution and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) at Rajpulmocon 2019 in Jaipur on Saturday. ""In our study, it was found that cities, in which there was more pollution indicated by PM2.5 levels, the percentage of HP cases was more. One-unit increase in PM2.5 levels lead to 0.7% more chances of developing HP, rather than any other form of ILD,"" Dr Singh told TOI. HP is a type of ILD which causes shrinkage of lung. The symptoms of the disease are, dry cough and difficulty in breathing while walking or climbing stairs. The disease is caused due to trigger factors such as birds like pigeons and parrots, mold growth, contaminated air coolers and air conditioners. She further elaborated that the proportion of new-onset ILD cases clinically diagnosed as HP increased with higher levels of air pollution in several Indian cities. ""This is a striking hypothesis which needs further substantiation with studies with longitudinal design and comparison groups,"" she said. The study was conducted in 19 centres across 11 cities in India, patients with all types of ILD were recruited. In the ILD India registry, 842 out of 1,084 (78%) patients diagnosed with ILD were residing in cities with high PM2.5 levels during the study period available for analysis. Among those ILD patients, 386 out of 842 (45.8%) were diagnosed with HP. The annual mean PM2.5 levels were obtained retrospectively from data provided by the state pollution control boards to the World Health Organization.The study talked about the increasing levels of air pollutants in urban areas over the past decade, including particulate matter less than 2.5m in diameter (PM2.5), which can reach the alveoli. ""Among measures of air pollution, PM2.5 levels have the greatest health impact; higher PM2.5 levels are associated with early mortality. Recently, the role of particulate matter less than 10m in diameter (PM10) has been associated with increased rate of decline of lung functions in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF),"" says the study.

Kolkata chokes as Dhapa fire rages unchecked for five years,"KOLKATA: A fire raging continually for at least five years at various locations in the city's largest dump yard, Dhapa, has been identified as the biggest contributor to Kolkata's spiking air-pollution levels.This fire - out of sight and, therefore, out of mind - may be even more dangerous to the city's long-term health than the practice of stubble-burning across farms in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, which has been blamed for Delhi's rising pollution levels, say environmentalists. Stubble-burning may have a greater geographical reach but the Dhapa fumes contain a far more potent cocktail of toxic pollutants because of the vast range of waste materials that go on burning in this open-air incinerator throughout the year.Smoke from burning waste at Dhapa dumpyard.Fish farm workers and rag pickers living on the edges of Dhapa say they saw smoke emerging from the dump for the first time around 2013. But the footprint of the fire has gone on increasing over the years and the emerging smoke has grown denser and more acrid. ""The smoke is an almost all-year phenomenon except for the two heavy-monsoon months. The fire is raging constantly deep in the dump's core,"" Gour Das, a resident of Unchopota village to the east of the mountain of rubbish, said. /""It's just that the burning core expands and the smouldering flames become visible in the dry season. The acrid smoke spews out and smothers the entire locality, making breathing difficult, round the year,"" he added.Dumpyard fumes worse than vehicular emission: ScientistsThe damage to human lungs is not confined to people staying on Dhapa's fringes. A wide swathe of Kolkata's population - on EM Bypass's western flank from Ultadanga to Chingrighata to Ruby and beyond - is affected by this cocktail of noxious gases. Many have to taken to just keeping their windows shut throughout the year. But the situation deteriorates in winter, when the dipping temperature and the fog keep pollutants close to the ground, making it difficult for people staying in this belt to even step out after dusk.""The entire EM Bypass stretch gets enveloped in a thick of layer of smoke - unbreathable and suffocating - nearly every evening this season. We just run to catch a bus to escape the foul air,"" said Ankita Sharma, an employee of an FMCG firm located near Ruby crossing.Environment scientists at the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri), who are conducting a pollution apportionment study in Kolkata and Howrah, say the effect is not restricted to just this belt but contributes significantly to the city's worsening air quality. There is no air quality monitoring station on EM Bypass to measure pollutants spewing out of Dhapa, but West Bengal Pollution Control Board chairman Kalyan Rudra admitted they get swept across the city, especially when the northerly winds blow into Kolkata in winter.""The effect of air pollution is far more widespread, unlike noise pollution that impacts the immediate surroundings,"" Rudra said. He has written to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation on the need to douse the fire. KMC officials admit there has been no attempt to control the fire yet, which would be a mammoth challenge given the volume of garbage that has been dumped at the site for decades.All this has contributed to the city's ever-worsening pollution levels. The daily average air quality index at the Victoria Memorial monitoring station touched 389 in December despite being located in the middle of the city's largest green belt, the Maidan. ""The smoke emitted from Dhapa is responsible for the unusual spike in air pollution recorded at the Victoria Memorial Hall station more than 10km away,"" said emission expert Somendra Mohan Ghosh.Environment activists say the debilitating effect of the fire raging under the surface has been most pronounced in 2018, indicating that it has gained critical mass. ""For the first time, I have had to wind up the car's window whenever it hit EM Bypass in December 2018. The air is choking. It turns the air toxic for rest of the city as well,"" said environmentalist Subhas Datta, who has been the main mover behind many of the city's green norms.The fire will never be short of fuel, given that 4,500 tonnes of unsegregated garbage are dumped at Dhapa daily and the putrefying mass releases the highly inflammable methane. Locals corroborate this expert view, saying the fire has spread to multiple locations within the the 23-acre yard.Inhaling fumes from the dump 24x7 is far worse than exposure to vehicular emission, say scientists. ""The garbage at Dhapa is everything that we should never burn. The white smoke contains ultra-fine particulate matters like dioxins and furans,"" said Calcutta University chemical engineering professor Amitava Bandyopadhyay.""Air containing such harmful chemicals can cause chain reactions in our bodies, right from disrupting our endocrine system (causing sexual disorder) to cancer,"" explained preventive care expert Debasish Basu.

'34 lakh homes got clean fuel in 3 years in Maharashtra under PM scheme',"MUMBAI: Santosh Nivendkar, state level coordinator (oil industry), Maharashtra, said on Saturday that Prime Minister's Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) was a revolution which removed smoke from kitchens of poor households in the country by providing them access to clean cooking fuel. Air pollution due to smoke from firewood, coal or kerosene burnt by over 34 lakh homes or families in slums, semi-urban and rural areas of the state had been ""taken away"" in the past three years, as six crore homes/families had adopted clean fuel LPG cylinders in the country, he said. /Launched in May 2016 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, PMUY has provided six crore LPG connections, of which 34 lakh are from Maharashtra. Experts claimed better quality of air we breathe now in the state since the two-and-half-year-old initiative has started bearing fruits. The state is now 96% LPG-connected and the rest is expected this year. Around 88% of 34 lakh refilled cylinders after availing of connections. Around 78% opted for loans while availing cylinders. Following the overwhelming response to the scheme, the ministry of oil, petroleum and natural gas has set a fresh target of another three crore LPG connections, which is expected to virtually make the country 100% complaint in using clean fuel for cooking.In Maharashtra, BPCL has released 12.40 lakh connections, HPC 14.0 lakh and IOCL 8.22 lakh till December 2018.

'Bucket challenge' to thwart Bhogi pollution,"Madurai: The city municipal corporation, which is planning to celebrate an environment-friendly Bhogi festival this year, has thrown up a 'bucket challenge' for residents. The corporation will place buckets at 50 places for a period of 11 days where public dump waste, which they are planning to burn for the upcoming Bhogi festival falling on January 14. People can collect cloth bags for the waste they deposited.The buckets would be placed between January 11 and January 22 on all working days at the 50 designated places. According to the corporation officials, tonnes of waste is being burned during Bhogi every year. /It not only creates respiratory problem for children and elderly people but also damages the environment. Various old things including clothes, plastic waste, mat and electronic wastes are being burnt. The initiative is being taken in association with Kuppaikaran, an organization which deals with trash. According to officials, all the waste which people are supposed to keep aside to burn on Bhogi could be deposited. Cloth bags, which are in great demand after the state government banned single use plastics from January 1, will be issued to those who deposit. The buckets would be kept at the following places: Corporation zone I office on TB Road, Arappalayam bus terminal, Velliveethiyar girls higher secondary school, UPHC Sellur, Arappalayam Cross Road at Kalaivanar Hospital, Bypass Road (Subramaniyapillai Irakkam), Ansari Nagar ward office, near Income Tax Residence on Kulamangalam Main Road, ward office on Koodalnagar Main Road, bus terminal at Thabal Thanthi Nagar, Sundar Residential Association at Sammatipuram road.

Meanwhile, the district collector has called upon the people to ensure that Bhogi festival is celebrated in a smoke-free, dust-free manner. He said that burning of plastics, rubber and clothes could lead to emission of dangerous gases such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and others which could cause health hazards. It could also lead to air pollution and smog.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
TNPCB plans surprise checks in city to prevent Bhogi bonfires,"Trichy: Tamil Nadu Pollution control board (TNPCB) has decided to carry surprise inspection across city on Monday to prevent people from burning things as part of Bhogi festival that would lead to pollution.Bhogi bonfire is one of the rituals where useless household articles are thrown into fire. But in recent times, this ritual of bonfire has become the cause of immense air pollution due to burning of plastic items and rubber tyres.Trichy district environmental engineer, R Lakshmi said that teams have been formed to carry inspection to prevent such happenings in the city. Some of the locations have been identified in the city where officials would carry inspection to prevent incidents of burning pollutants like plastic or rubber, Lakshmi added.""While there are no plans to penalize people as of now, however, they will be instructed not to indulge in such activities,"" she said.Smoke emitting due to the bonfire remain in atmosphere for the next few days and as it is winter season, visibility remains low during the early hours due to fog and it will be further affected if smoke from bonfire remains in the atmosphere, she added.The fundamentals of Bhogi festival are to eliminate the old and unused materials but that can also be done in other ways. /People can donate their unused articles like clothes and other material to people in need, she said. K C Neelamegam, secretary of Thaneer - a city-based environmental organization, said that such incidents have come down in the recent time. This is mainly because most of the houses do not have tyres or unused plastic materials, which have already been removed as part of the anti-dengue initiatives.Students are being made to take oath in the morning assembly against burning of pollutants as part of Bhogi festival, said chief educational officer, M Ramakrishnan.

Watch lungs on billboard pump and choke on bad air,"LUCKNOW: An artificial pair of lungs was installed in Jhandi park opposite Lucknow Municipal Corporation on Thursday to monitor the air pollution level in the city.To make people visualise the quality of air and the impact of air pollution on health, the artificial lungs installed for 10 days will inhale and exhale ambient air round the clock.Two exhaust fans blow the air into the lungs made of white high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters which trap the pollutants while the air passes out. The artificial lungs will turn black on the presence of high particulate matter.""The HEPA filters and fans used in the structure make these lungs work like human respiratory system. When these lungs start changing colour, it will make people understand the impact of air pollution,"" said head of respiratory department, King George's Medical University, Dr Surya Kant.He said earlier only lungs of smokers were found with black or grey spots during examination, but now most patients suffering from respiratory problems have dark lungs due to high pollution levels.In New Delhi, the artificial lungs had turned black in just six days. The number of days in which the pair turns black will indicate the level of air toxicity in the state capital. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"As winter smog increases, Mumbai gears up for an air battle","Love winter? If you are someone who heads out in the morning for that early walk or run, you may feel breathless and it's not just from the fitness exertion. As the city sees a rise in pollution levels - with alarming increase in smog - Mumbaikars are left struggling to breathe right. For those who can't avoid the outdoors, it's a bleak situation, pun intended!/ For morning walkers and runners, there's no escapeKranti Salvi, city-based runner and international marathoner, says, ""These days the level of smog is high and visibility is also poor during the early hours at about 6 am. Though the weather is cooler, it is a pain to get outdoors and exercise. In fact, we runners dread this 'pollution season'. But since our training cannot be missed as we have everyday schedules, some of us wear anti-pollution masks at this time. I wish we had a greener cover in Mumbai to help protect us from the level of pollution."" Adds Savio D'Souza, who heads a runners group in South Mumbai, ""There is not much escape from the pollution in Mumbai. What choice we do have? Some areas like Chembur are worse. And runners do get up with coughs and colds as a result of the pollution, but nobody gives up their fitness regimen. I would say running by the sea is a better option due to the breezes, so we to Priyadarshini Park at Breach Candy and to Marine Drive once a week. When you want to run you run, pollution or not.""City-based baker Manish Gadia has been suffering from bronchitis owing to the high pollution levels. ""My daily travels are in rickshaws from Malad to Andheri and owing to the smog levels in winter, it gets very bad. One cannot avoid traffic pockets, especially on this route, so it's a complete health horror. I developed bronchitis a few months ago and it has gotten worse since winter started. Unfortunately, the city's brown infrastructure overtaking the green has led to this."" Richa Awasthi, who takes a bus to Marol from Dadar every day, recounts her distress. ""I leave home by 8 am and I wear a scarf around my face though the smog exposure is unavoidable. It's the same when I return in the evening. This situation is scary and we can't avoid taking public transit, so it's only at the individual level that we can take steps to protect ourselves. What else can we do?"" she asks. City docs sound a warning Chest specialist Dr Aditya Agrawal, says, ""Fog, pollution and cold air create a deadly cocktail at this time. This is especially worse for the very young and old, patients with chronic lung and heart diseases and diabetics. The cold dry winter months may mean frequent attacks and severe breathing difficulties. Stay indoors as much as possible during early morning hours and if you cannot do so, have lots of citrus fruits, drink milk and have lots of water."" Adds pulmonologist Dr Sushil Jain, ""There has been an increase in viral infection cases, over the last 10 days with people suffering from coughing and wheezing. Smog is unsafe; it's a mix of fog and pollution. And though it is inevitable part of life in the city, you have to be careful if you are outside walking or running. Do not venture outside to exercise during heavy smog. Try using an anti-pollution mask. Avoid main arterial roads and head to opens spaces and gardens."" Fitness expert's advice: Take the exercise indoorsIf you can't beat it, find a way around it, is the mantra! Says fitness expert, Madhuri Ruia, ""This season, when it the smog levels are high and you get unhealthy air pollution readings on the phone all the time! There are also with strange viruses doing the rounds. So, coming to the gym is a good idea now more than ever. Indoors, you can do things to suit the upper and lower body, from lunges to jumping rope, agility ladders, and even marathon training.If you are at work, try stair fitness workouts, such as stairwell running and brisk walking.""Hampers work productivityApart from its serious affecting implications, prolonged exposure to air pollution is said to reduce an employee's productivity. A definite drop in work output was witnessed when measured for more prolonged exposures of up to 30 days, said researchers.

"Phase out BS-III vehicles, induct electric buses: KSPCB to BMTC","Bengaluru: To reduce air pollution in the city, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) has directed Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) to phase out BS-III vehicles in its fleet and induct electric buses.Currently, BMTC has 3,067 BS-III and 3,423 BS-IV vehicles. However, the corporation's long-pending proposal to induct electric buses has been delayed after DC Thammanna, who's been pushing for the purchase of these buses over the more feasible lease option, took charge as transport minister. Responding to KSPCB, the BMTC said all BS-III buses would be scrapped in a phased manner when they are eligible for scrapping as per norms. /While the Centre implemented BS-III norms across the country in 2010, BS-IV is now in place for all new vehicles from April 2017.While the state government in 2017-18 announced the addition of 3,000 buses (1,500 on purchase basis and 1,500 on lease model), the National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked the BMTC to induct only environment-friendly vehicles like CNG buses to reduce pollution level in the city. However, operational and maintenance cost of CNG buses are much higher than the electric ones. BMTC cannot induct new diesel BS-IV buses because of the NGT ruling. The delay in taking a decision on electric buses is also affecting both the BMTC and the passengers.Further, the BMTC stated that the Union ministry of heavy industries has sanctioned financial assistance of Rs 1 crore for AC electric buses and Rs 74.7 lakh for 80 non-AC electric buses. ""These buses are proposed for operation on gross cost model (lease model) and the tender process is finalised. The letter of intent was issued to the successful tenderer for operating 60 AC premium and 20 non-AC electric buses,"" said BMTC in its response to KSPCB. The transport minister has given the nod to procure these buses. However, the government is yet to decide on whether to lease or purchase them, it added.BMTC officials said their operational jurisdiction has been extended up to 25km beyond BBMP limits. ""BMTC is operating 1,024 schedules, with 16,078 trips to city areas and 5,152 schedules, with 53,125 trips to suburban areas,"" they said.""BMTC buses are being subjected to emission checks on a monthly basis, for which all depots are equipped with computerised smoke-testing facilities. Action will be taken to withdraw buses from operation if they emit smoke beyond permissible limit,"" they added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
It's more than 'a couple of years': Experts to minister,"KOLKATA: The state environment minister hit the bull's eye when he said on Wednesday that ""air pollution was reducing lifespans"" and ""some people could have lived a couple of years longer"" had our air not been so polluted. Experts on Thursday agreed with Suvendu Adhikari but quoted a recent study to show that citizens were paying with more than ""a couple of years"". Air pollution had led to a reduction of 6.1 years in Bengal's average life expectancy, the last such study done jointly by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and the National Centre for Atmospheric Resrearch in 2016 revealed.This reduced average life expectancy was only second to Delhi's, which stood at 6.4 years. Diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, asthma, bronchitis and respiratory allergies were a direct fallout of high levels of PM 2.5 (particulate matter 2.5 microns or less in size), which could enter human lungs and bloodstream much more easily because of their small size, environmental experts said on Thursday.""The city has been covered by a cloud of poisonous carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide fumes since last November,"" Fortis Hospital internal medicine consultant Joydeep Ghosh said.'Pollution directly responsible for severe lung ailments this winter'Winters have always been a high-pollution period but this time this has been longer than usual. /The counts show that it has been getting worse every passing year and this is evident in our clinics. COPD patients have found it difficult to cope with this winter and asthma and bronchitis attacks have been very severe. Pollution is directly responsible for this,"" Joydeep Ghosh added.Chronic bronchitis and emphysema or the lung turning inelastic have become common in Kolkata, according to Debashish Saha, consultant at AMRI Hospital. ""These are the two most common forms of COPD and the number of patients has been spiralling sharply. Prolonged exposure to pollution is responsible for this. The number of patients suffering from respiratory distress and breathlessness is rising every year and, more alarmingly, the severity of these ailments is now markedly higher,"" Saha said, adding that this could be attributed to the higher pollution intensity.""The continual high levels of pollution, which have stayed in the 'severe' category almost every day this winter, contribute directly to the dip in life expectancy that the 2016 study speaks about,"" he added.Respiratory allergies are now arguably the most common form of illness in Kolkata, say doctors. A constant onslaught of carcinogenic gases is putting the respiratory tract under severe stress. ""Allergic cough, sneezing, wheezing and shortness of breath strike more frequently than ever before. Those with COPD are suffering more severe spells of breathlessness or acute COPD,"" Belle Vue Clinic critical care expert Samarjit Naskar said. ""Pollutants like benzene and sulphur dioxide act on the nucleus of cells and alter them. This could lead to diseases like cancer that reduce our life expectancy,"" said Naskar.The 2016 study also says that 70% of Kolkata's population suffer from pollution-induced respiratory disorders. More severe bouts of asthma attacks were an important indicator of the rising intensity of pollution-induced ailments, confirmed consultant Arindam Biswas.""It confirms that pollution is infiltrating the lungs more frequently now. Over the last five winters, asthma patients in Kolkata have had repeated attacks. Asthma patients are usually more sensitive to the air they breathe in and are the first victims of pollution. Such repeated attacks have made them depend on medication, which will definitely shorten their life-span. The same holds true for COPD patients and even those with a cardiac condition since the lung and the heart are closely related,"" said Biswas.Smokers were far more vulnerable than the rest, according to Ranjan Das, pulmonologist, CMRI Hospital. ""We now find that smokers suffer more frequently from upper and lower respiratory tract infections than ever before. This is especially true in winter when the pollution load rises sharply. It can be linked to the city's rising pollution,"" said Das. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Delhi has become gas chamber, no longer a liveable city: SC","NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over the life-threatening pollution level in Delhi which is getting worse with each passing year, the Supreme Court on Thursday said that the city has converted into a gas chamber and is no liveable place.A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta said more efforts are required to be made by governments to deal with the menace of pollution and traffic jam in the city and sought explanation from Delhi government on delay in implementing new parking policy and constructing Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System(RRTS) which is intended to de-congest traffic on Delhi roads.""It is better not to live to live in Delhi. It is very difficult to live in Delhi. I do not wish to settle here... It is like a gas chamber,"" Justice Mishra said. /He also said that he got stuck in a massive traffic jam while on his way to Supreme Court in the morning and somehow managed to reach on time for swearing-in of two judges.Ill effects of air pollution on the health of Delhi residents have been well documents and as per one report, its impact can be compared to smoking of 15-20 cigarettes a day. As per Berkeley Earth, science research group report breathing in air with a PM2.5 content of between 950 to 1,000 is considered roughly equivalent to smoking 44 cigarettes a day.Advocate Aparajita Singh told the bench that 82 km long RRTS corridor under-development is the most important project but it is getting delayed as the Delhi government refused to provide its share of the fund. She said that there is a complete stalemate and pleaded the court to intervene.Delhi government contended that it has no fund to spare for the project and it had requested the Centre to also bear the burden of its share in the project. The total cost of the project is around Rs 22,552 crore out of which Delhi has to pay Rs 11,038 cr and the Centre has to pay Rs 5686 cr. Rest of the amount is to be paid by Uttar Pradesh government.""Delhi government is also not agreeable to the revised alignment of RRTS corridor due to change of station at Sarai Kale Khan from underground to elevated. It is of the view that the change of plan would seriously delay the redevelopment of Sarai Kale Khan ISBT being undertaken by the government,"" Delhi government said in its affidavit.Taking strong exception to Delhi government's stand, the bench said that the project cannot depend on its ""mercy"" and it is the government's duty to provide funds as the project is very essential for the city. ""You are bound to provide the fund. You cannot act like this,"" the bench said. The court also questioned the Delhi government on for objecting on constructing elevated station as the decision was approved by experts.The bench directed the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) to convene a meeting of all stakeholders in the project within a week to clear all the hurdles and streamline the project. The Court also directed the Delhi government to notify new parking policy within ten days to decongest roads. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Fossil fuel use turns every breath poison in Kolkata: Study,"KOLKATA: A near-complete dependence on fossil fuel by the transport sector in the city - both private and commercial - is the biggest contributor to air pollution in the city, specifically that of PM2.5, the most harmful particulate matter, the first comprehensive study pinpointing individual sources of pollution in Kolkata has revealed.The source apportionment study, conducted by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) spread over two seasons, was commissioned by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board and covers the twin cities of Kolkata and Howrah.Apart from finding out the various polluting sources, the idea was to fix ways to effectively combat the situation.PM 2.5 is a fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometre or less. These tiny particles are the ones that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are high. More dangerously, PM 2.5 particles are very easily breathed in, and are responsible for causing a host of diseases, including cancer. Global studies have shown that there is no safe level for this particulate matter. /A 2013 study in nine European countries showed that for every increase of 10 microgram per cubic metre, the lung cancer rate increased by 36%.PM 10, the other particulate matter that was the subject of the NEERI study, are larger, with a diameter between 2.5 and 10 micrometres, and are only slightly less harmful. The same 2013 study in Europe showed lung cancer rates increasing by 22% for every increase of 10 microgram per cubic metre in PM 10. The NEERI study has shown that PM 10 levels across Kolkata and Howrah are also alarmingly high, and the blame for this should be shared by dust and vehicle exhaust, but mostly road and construction dust.The interim report of the source apportionment study was prepared on the basis of an exercise undertaken in the summer of 2017, following an analysis of pollutants collected from seven stations in Kolkata and two in Howrah.""This is quite understandable because of the skewed diesel and petrol vehicle ratio,"" said green crusader Subhas Datta, who has relentlessly pursued the National Green Tribunal on Kolkata's falling air quality.Moulali was worst polluted in winter of 2017-2018, says studyGreen crusader Subhas Datta said, ""In Kolkata, the growth of diesel vehicles has far outpaced that of petrol vehicles in the last decade. Diesel vehicles are the single biggest source of particulate matter. Laboratory analyses of particulate matters of diesel exhaust by the American Lung Association of California had revealed more than 40 toxic contaminants, of which 26 are carcinogenic.""Of the nine stations in Kolkata and Howrah, in the winter of 2017-2018, Howrah Maidan topped with a PM2.5 count of 379 microgram per cubic metre. In Kolkata, Moulali was the worst polluted, with a PM2.5 count of 263 microgram per cubic metre.While the overall scenario, so far, suggests that the dependence on fossil fuels was the biggest contributing factor for both forms of particulate matter in Kolkata and Howrah, the study also hints at seasonal variations in the air pollution count.In the air quality report of the winter of 2017-2018, the provisional PM2.5 emission estimates (in metric tonnes per year) showed hotels and restaurants on top (2,692.5), followed by households (1,650.7), construction (164.4) and then transport tailpipe exhaust (710.8). These provisional samples need further analysis for a conclusion to be reached, said experts.The source apportionment exercise undertaken with ambient particulate matter samples in different seasons is expected to generate varying contributions from various sources, depending on the presence or absence of these sources in each season and the seasonwise strengths and weaknesses of the source activities.

Vaccine refusal a key threat: WHO,"NEW DELHI: Refusal or hesitation to get vaccination against deadly diseases despite availability of vaccines is seen as one of the top threats to public health, according to World Health Organisation (WHO). The UN agency recently released a list of what it considers the top 10 threats to global health for 2019, which include air pollution, obesity and antibiotic resistance. This is the first time that vaccine hesitancy has made it to the UN agency's list of ten biggest threats to world health. ""Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective ways of avoiding disease - it currently prevents 2-3 million deaths a year, and a further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccination improved,"" it said. In India, lack of awareness and information coupled with apprehension of adverse event following immunisation are seen as the major reasons for children not getting vaccinated. The two factors together account for around 65% of the children not getting vaccine coverage, as per government estimates. Between 2014 and 2018, India's annual immunisation growth rate has risen to 4% from 1% previously. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Wild swing in results of PUC checks done the same day,"Pune: Have you ever tested your vehicles for emissions more than once the same day? The results could surprise you. A couple of such tests tried by TOI - within a span of just 40 minutes - show that carbon monoxide (CO) levels changed by over 300% for a BS-II standard motorcycle and a BS-IV standard scooter, while hydrocarbon (HC) levels altered by more than 400% for the same motorcycle and over 950% for the scooter.Automakers are preparing to roll out vehicles meeting the relatively cleaner Bharat Stage (BS) VI emission norms from April 2020, but the after-market infrastructure to check actual emissions leaves a lot to be desired. ""All you have is this yellow slip (the certificate). No one checks the values, only the dates,"" one pollution under check (PUC) van operator said.Another operator prepared to issue a certificate without testing the vehicle, and refused to issue one when this correspondent insisted that he test the two-wheeler. /""You can take (the certificate) from someone who is willing to check,"" was the operator's brusque response, as he binned the certificate. Interestingly, certificates issued after testing by one PUC van operator for the motorcycle (on January 9) and the scooter (on January 22) had the same values - 0.370% (CO) and 160-180 ppm (HC). Pune's regional transport officer Babasaheb Ajri told TOI that they were aware of such malpractices and certificates being issued without due checks. He said there was undated plan to improve the system by uploading the captured data to a common database for further action. ""The RTO does carry out some random checks on vans to see if the machines used meet norms specified by Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI),"" he said.However, during the checks done by TOI, the numbers on the machines were not legible. Moreover, the machine switched off the moment the testing probe was removed. Explanations issued by the operators didn't quite pass muster - ""If the number keeps changing, then your vehicle is polluting"", or, ""the readings change because it is likely that the fuel was mixed at the filling station"".At one PUC centre at a filling station, the operator offered to issue a certificate without testing. When TOI insisted that the vehicle be checked, the operator claimed the machine was non-functional. Testing of vehicles is done as per the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. The testing should be done after the engine had run for at least 15 minutes in normal traffic conditions. ""During the test, the vehicle engine shall be running at idling speed and the sampling probe shall be inserted into the vehicle exhaust system to a depth not less than 300mm. In case CO and/or HC emission values recorded are not within the limits, the testing shall be discontinued and the vehicle owner shall be advised to resubmit the vehicle after repair/service,"" the rules read. Vehicles account for about 20-30% of the air pollution, according to a study in the National Capital Region by ARAI and Delhi-based The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). This is evident in the thick black cloud of smoke that forms on busy roads of the city. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Mumbai: Veg reduces cancer risk? Diet of 2 lakh monitored,"MUMBAI: India has lower cancer rates than the West, but registers a larger death rate among patients. Given India's population, even the lower percentage means the number is huge. Over 11 lakh new patients are diagnosed with cancer every year in India. /As lifestyle and environmental factors are believed to be factors, there seems to be a stark urban-rural divide. ""While the cancer rate in Mumbai is 120 per 1,00,000, it is 50 in Barshi,'' said Dr Rajesh Dikshit, head of Tata Memorial Hospital's Centre for Cancer Epidemiology (CCE). It is believed that the Indian vegetarian diet along with spices such as turmeric provides better antioxidant support to cells, thereby reducing the risk of cancer. ""However, this is a loose theory with no scientific backup. We are hence carrying out this long-term ISHA study,'' he added. Incidentally, a previous study done by the hospital's doctors had shown a link between gall bladder cancer and a diet of fresh water fish and mustard oil in the areas along the Gangetic plain. The other study that CCE's doctors are excited about is the link between lung cancer and air pollution. CCE, which is located in Tata Hospital's Khargar campus, has teamed up with the IIT-Kanpur to develop an air pollution monitor. ""We will place these monitors in the homes of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients who come to the hospital for treatment,'' said Dr Dikshit. Similar monitors will be placed in nearby homes of people not affected by cancer. The idea is to look for epigenetic signatures or changes in blood/DNA caused by air pollution. ""We are working with University of Bristol's specialists who recently published a study on epigenetic markers among smokers,'' he added.

"Tata Memorial Hospital monitors daily diet, air quality of lakhs to gauge cancer risk","MUMBAI: With lifestyle and environmental factors emerging as key reasons for the rising incidence of cancer, two mega studies have been conceived by Tata Memorial Hospital to gauge if diet and quality of air impacts on overall health.  In the first study, the hospital's doctors are closely monitoring the daily diet of 2 lakh people living in Solapur district's Barshi town and 362 surrounding villages. In another study, the hospital's doctors will start placing indigenously developed air pollution monitors at the homes of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients to establish a correlation if at all.  These studies seem significant in the backdrop that genetic causes can only be attributed to 5% to 10% of all cancers while lifestyle and environment factors such as the food one eats and air one breathes reportedly play a large role in cancer causation. / ""There has been a change in our country's cancer epidemiology in recent years. While the incidence of breast cancer has increased, the incidence of cervical cancer is decreasing. There also are regional differences to cancer rate. It is to study such epidemiological patterns that Tata Memorial Hospital's Centre for Cancer Epidemiology (CCE) has undertaken various studies,'' said CCE's head Dr Rajesh Dikshit.  Apart from exploring the extent of diet's contribution to cancer risk, CCE's dietary study-the Indian Study for Health of Adults (ISHA)-may also provide an answer to whether the India diet that is mainly vegetarian offers better protection than a non-vegetarian against cancer. Cancer rates in the West are double or triple India's rates, said the doctor. For instance, the cancer rate in the US is 300 per 1,00,000 population, while the corresponding figure is 100 per 1,00,000 in India. ""Even within India, we see a stark urban-rural divide. While the cancer rate in Mumbai is 120 per 1,00,000, it is 50 in Barshi,'' said Dr Dikshit. It is believed that the Indian vegetarian diet along with spices such as turmeric provides better antioxidant support to cells, thereby reducing the risk of cancer.

Hospital admissions jump by 15% due to bad air quality,"Mumbai: A nagging cough worsened by air pollution has left Sadananand Bhaskar (71) housebound for nearly two months. The Dadar resident says this December he was diagnosed with asthma, a debilitating lung condition that severely restricted mobility and increased hospital visits manifold. He required hospitalisations twice since then.Thousands of Mumbaikars have been bearing the brunt of viral diseases and respiratory ailments since December, their conditions aggravated by a deadly cocktail of widespread construction activity, bad air quality, low humidity levels combined with a prolonged dip in day and night temperatures. As a result, doctors say, patient footfalls in chest outpatient departments had increased by 5-30%, while admissions rose by at least 15%. The average duration of hospitalisation ranged between 8-10 days, with some, including people with no prior history of lung ailments, requiring aggressive intervention, such as oxygen support and non-invasive ventilation.A 34-year-old Bandra resident rushed to a chest specialist when cough left him breathless. /The doctor was surprised to see that he had full-blown pneumonia. ""Any delay would have landed him in serious life-risk,"" said his wife. She said he used to be a smoker but never suffered such a critical lung problem before. They spent nearly Rs 2.5 lakh on treatment.Physicians say there was a visible spurt in cases of people with prolonged dry cough, throat irritation, allergic bronchitis, rhinitis and asthma. ""In my OPD, people who came with severe cough, bronchospasms, and needed nebulising treatment to even ventilator must have gone up by 12-13% this season,"" said Dr Salil Bendre, pulmonologist at Balabhai Nanavati Hospital, Vile Parle. Chest and allergy expert Dr Sanjeev Mehta said at one point he had three patients with bad pneumonia in a ward. ""Multiple zones of their lungs were badly affected,"" he said. The doctor added that this season he has witnessed a near 50% increase in hospitalisation of people with lung ailments.Dr Amita Athavale, who heads the department of chest medicine at Parel's KEM Hospital, said persistent lower humidity levels of less than 40% can spell bad news for respiratory infections. ""That's when mucous starts accumulating and worsening things for lung patients. But lack of hydration, low vitamin B complex and D levels can make things worse,"" she said. Chest physician Dr Sujeet Rajan concurred that Mumbaikars are not used to continuous minimum temperature levels of 17-20 degrees. ""Many of these infections, particularly bronchitis, are the body's defence system trying to fight it,"" he said. Dr Athavale advocated pneumococcal and influenza vaccination, particularly for the elderly.Maximum temp drops further, minimum still highMumbai: The city's maximum temperature on Wednesday dropped further, compared to the last two days. But the minimum temperature continued to be on the higher side. The maximum recorded by IMD Colaba and Santacruz on Wednesday dropped to below 30 degrees Celsius. This was significant considering that the maximum recorded two days back had crossed 35 degrees. The maximum recorded at Colaba was 29.2 degrees and at Santacruz, 28.8 degrees. IMD officials said the drop in maximum temperature was due to coastal winds turning northerly to north-westerly. The minimum recorded at Colaba and Santacruz was 21.2 degrees and 20 degrees respectively. At Colaba, the minimum was 1.7 degrees above normal, and at Santacruz, it was 2.5 degrees above normal. tnn For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

""Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) is emerging as a vital component in detecting respiratory diseases. Nitric oxide or NO is found in air as a part of air pollution which can cause severe respiratory ailments depending on the exposure. However, when the patient exhales the gas, the amount of it present in the body helps in determining how severe the ailment is,"" said Pethe.""It is 100% accurate, safe and a fairly simple test in which patients are asked to blow into the machine. It is helpful in determining disorders especially if all other traditional methods like spirometry fail,"" he added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

There is a need to ensure availability of improved equipment in agriculture sector and spread awareness about the ills of stubble burning. /Investment in clean industries is also required,"" Kelly said.While WHO's 2018 air pollution global ranking puts around 30 areas in the UK at 10 micrograms per cubic metre above the permissible limits or just at the limit, India's 14 cities top the WHO ranking with PM2.5 levels being more than 3 or 4.5 times higher than the national standards, which are more relaxed in comparison to the WHO AQI standards. There is no comparison between the air pollution levels that each country is facing - the scale of the problem that India is dealing with is a national health emergency.If India reduces particulate pollution by 25%, under the National Clean Air Programme goal, residents of Delhi and UP could live almost three years longer, according to a recent report from the Air Quality Life Index, a pollution index that translates particulate air pollution into its impact on life expectancy.""Each year, on average, we have 10 air pollution episodes (in London). On a scale of 1-10 where 10 is the worst, we have three episodes. Those episodes will be seen here as 'moderate'. We no longer reach 100s of micrograms like Delhi. (The) problem is considerably less (in UK). But we know that it's still impacting children's lung development. It is having an effect on the other end of life like neo-degenerative diseases. It also causes heart ailments and COPD,"" he said.Both India and the UK recently introduced national clean air plans. NCAP looks at reducing PM2.5 and 10 levels by 20-30% by 2024, whereas the Clean Air Strategy aims to reduce PM2.5 levels across the UK so that the number of people living in locations above the WHO guideline level of 10 micro grams/m3 is reduced by 50% by 2025. ""We need to move to a point where people are not suffering with these conditions and costing our national health service hundreds of millions of pounds. In London, the mayor has introduced a series of progressive measures that will lead to marked improvement in air quality. Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) will start from April 2019 to create stricter emissions standards for diesel vehicles, 24 hours, 7 days a week, entering the city,"" Kelly said.By 2020, London has committed to the use of electric or hydrogen buses for all 300 single-decker buses in Central London, and hybrid buses for all 3,000 double-decker buses in the same area. For the iconic black cabs, from January 1, 2018, any new vehicle to be licensed had to be electric. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Lack of doctors hits healthcare services,"PATNA: The Economic Survey report tabled in the state assembly on Monday stated that 57% posts of regular doctors and 77% posts of contractual doctors are lying vacant in government hospitals in the state.Of the 7,249 sanctioned posts of regular doctors, only 3,146 are currently filled. Similarly, of the 2314 sanctioned strength of contractual doctors, only 533 positions are filled.According to the report, there has been a fall in overall bed occupancy rate in the health establishments across the state from 84% in 2015-2016 to 62% in 2017- 2018. The survey observed that performance of government healthcare centres has dropped and participation of private facilities increased in the state.The survey said acute respiratory infection (ARI) was the leading disease in the state in 2017-2018. Around 12.8 lakh people suffered from ARI during this period mainly due to air pollution. On a positive note, the survey found that the number of patients visiting hospitals per month increased from 9,871 in 2014 to 10,446 in 2017-18, an increase of 5.8%. Between April-September 2018, the average number of patients visiting hospitals per month was around 9,952.""The rise in footfall of patients in government hospitals was the result of comprehensive health services with provision of free medicines and quality care,"" the survey noted. /The state has 37 district hospitals, 70 referral hospitals, 55 sub-divisional hospitals, 533 PHCs, 9,949 sub-centres and 1,379 APHCs. Thus, there are about 99 health centres in the state per 10 lakh of population. To meet the challenge of infrastructural deficiency in healthcare facilities, the state government has targeted to upgrade 399 of 533 six-bed PHCs to thirty-bed community health centres (CHC), the survey said.

Air pollution deaths among highest in Bengal: Study,"Nimli (Rajasthan): Bengal has the highest air pollution-related deaths among states in the mid socio-demographic index (SDI) segment, according to a report published by Centre for Science & Environment (CSE), a Delhi-based public interest research and advocacy organisation.According to the annual report, released on Monday by former Supreme Court judge Madan B Lokur, nearly 40% of air pollution-related deaths in India in 2017 were reported from UP, West Bengal and Maharashtra. Of all states, Bengal's rank is fourth. According to the SDI classification, however, the state tops its category. /Uttar Pradesh is in the low SDI category, while Maharashtra is in the high bracket.SDI is measured based on average income per person, educational attainment and total fertility rate (TFR). Low SDI represents the lowest income per capita, lowest educational attainment and highest TFR.The report says that air pollution is responsible for close to 13% deaths in India, with its burden highest mostly in the northern belt of Delhi, Punjab, UP and Haryana, apart from Bengal. The report also points to more disability-adjusted life years (DALY) lost due to respiratory infections triggered by air pollution than tobacco consumption. ""In fact, an average Indian will live 1.7 years longer, if the country is able to clean its air,"" said Sunita Narain, CSE's director-general. Kolkata's air quality, in fact, has been particularly poor this winter. On the first day of 2019, the AQI at the air quality monitoring station at Rabindra Bharati University, BT Road, hovered around 500 between midnight and 2am. Thereafter, it had remained close to 400. Even the air quality monitoring station at the Victoria Memorial never dipped below 350.In December, the AQI was severe on seven days, very poor on 21 days and poor for just a day. It was moderate on December 18 and 19, thanks to untimely rain. ""This is the worst-ever December as far as the city's air quality goes. On most days, we are far worse than Delhi,"" said Ajay Mittal of Kolkata Clean Air, a platform for environmentalists and activists.The latest study revealed that Delhi's air quality, though poor, was showing definite signs of improvement following steps that had been taken in the wake of increased public consciousness. ""A cohesive action from key stakeholders is needed to battle Kolkata's declining air quality. The 2018 graded action plan for Delhi is a lesson for every city,"" said Narain.It was Justice Lokur's order that had led to the comprehensive action plan for NCR. ""Air pollution is a great leveller. It affects the rich and poor alike. So, some action has been noticed. But there must be an investigation where the pollution is being shifted,"" the retired judge said, releasing the report. He expressed regret that Calcutta High Court had discontinued the Green Bench, with the commencement of the NGT.Auto emission consultant Somendra Mohan Ghosh, too, felt urgent measures were needed for Kolkata, such as those adopted in Delhi. The impact of air pollution on death, disease burden and life expectancy across states by Lancet attributed 93.3 deaths to pollution per a population of 1 lakh in Bengal in 2017.

Meet the authors writing debut novels in their 80s,"Shukla Lal's daughter would often find her squinting at her phone early in the morning. She'd tell her mother, who had just turned 80, not to be on her phone when she had barely woken up. Turns out, Lal wasn't just sending good morning messages to family members - she was writing. ""It started with poems,"" Lal says. /""I wrote 29 nazms in the space of a month. I would be inspired by something, like watching a tree shed leaves or a house being dismantled, and the words would just flow out of me.""Her collection of poems was followed by a novel about a partition-era love story, which she wrote in the span of three months. And after that novel? Well, she wrote another - this time it was 'Floating Logs', a historical romance book set in the Calcutta of her youth. Lal, now 82 and working on her third manuscript, compares the flood of writing to a ""vertical avalanche"" of inspiration.Lal may be unique in the sense that writing seems to be a meditative experience for her, but she isn't the only Indian author who has penned their first book at an older age. Jharna Banerji, 82, began writing her novel, 'Perched on the Periphery,' while her husband was ailing with Parkinson's disease. Her book is about an older widow who has been made to immigrate to live with her children, and how she grapples with finding her own identity. ""It took me a long 10 years to write this book as I was a full-time caregiver and a spare time raconteur of this tale. The process of writing was cathartic, because when you write you are never alone or lonely,"" says Banerji, who started writing the book at 65.Older authors have a wealth of experience, at a basic level, simply because of the changes they seen. Inspired by her reflections about how much India has changed since she was a child, Lal enjoys writing historical romance novels. They combine her inherently romantic nature with her desire to bring people into the India she grew up in. ""The post-Partition India where my kids grew up was peaceful. There was a strong awareness of and respect for other communities. I wanted to convey that harmony,"" she says.Banerji agrees with the idea that being older gives one valuable perspective. ""I feel that having such a broad spectrum experience of life as the elderly do, if they can remain rational, and see the past and the present in a balanced manner, then they have the wherewithal to do wonders with it,"" says the Pune resident.For others, post-retirement life allows them the opportunity to look back not only at the way the world has evolved, but also at their own careers and accomplishments. For Kiran Doshi, 80, it took retiring from the IFS to start writing about his experiences. 'Birds of Passage,' his first book, was a satirical look at diplomatic circles set in the world of India-Pakistan-US relations. His most recent book 'Jinnah Often Came to Our House' is a fictionalised account asking the question, ""Why is it so difficult to improve our relations with Pakistan?""Reflecting on his decision to start writing fiction after retiring he says, ""As a career diplomat I had to write a lot all my working life. Yet I have no doubt that if I had started writing fiction when I was much younger, I would have become more skillful at it by the time I turned 60."" While that may be the case, he adds, ""What the older writer says has greater depth, I feel. The reason? He can see more.""Parth Mehrotra, commissioning editor of publishing house Juggernaut, says, ""Especially in non-fiction, an older author brings a lifetime of experience. A journalist or a civil servant or a politician or a doctor, looking back on their career can have invaluable insights.""Kamal Meattle, 74, is perhaps the ultimate exemplification of this kind of non-fiction writing. His book, 'How to Grow Fresh Air,' is about his work as an environmentalist, specifically in air pollution management. He reflects on how he tackled pollution in Delhi and offers solutions to readers about how they can better the air they breathe.Meattle was inspired by his younger son who compared him to an Ayurveda who has found a solution for himself but won't share it with others. ""In the 1990s, I became allergic to Delhi's air and the doctors told me to leave. I would go away and be OK, but as soon as I came back, there would be problems,"" he says. ""My friends are here, my life is here, why would I want to disappear?"" So, instead, he focused on finding his own solutions, including a cleaning system he installed in his Nehru Place office. He adds: ""The idea behind the book was to use simple language to help people help themselves"" Meattle is now working on a similar book geared towards children.For many, getting older means finally having the time to pursue writing with the dedication their busy lives didn't allow. Lal says, ""I couldn't write earlier because I had so much on my hands. At this age, my mind is free, so why not write?"" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Smoke alarm,"Kolkata: If Delhi can, why can't Kolkata? That's the question slowly - and also steadily and firmly - gaining ground. Indeed, why cannot Kolkata phase out diesel vehicles, or enforce a complete ban on the registration of such vehicles?We, surely, aren't overreacting, nor are we asking for too much. For Kolkatans, this has been a winter of discontent. /All through November, December, January and February, the air quality index (AQI) of the city has been as poor as Delhi's, and sometimes worse. Even at its best, the index has consistently remained poor or severe.In January, 21 of 31 days were in the 'very poor' or 'severe' category; February was not much better, with 10 days of its first 12 days in the 'very poor' category.The fleet of diesel vehicles plying in the city can easily be singled out as the biggest culprits, since PM2.5 is the most prominent of pollutants of the city's air. The interim report on source apportionment study on air pollution, by National Environment Engineering and Research Institute (NEERI), bears this out. The study revealed that vehicles were the biggest emitters (23%) of PM2.5, arguably the most dangerous of all pollutants in the city's ambient air.""This is largely due to the skewed diesel to petrol vehicle ratio,"" says activist Subhas Datta, who has relentlessly argued before the National Green Tribunal on the declining air quality of the city, making a strong argument for the need to stringently restrict diesel vehicles.""In Kolkata,"" Datta adds, ""the number of diesel vehicles has far outpaced the number of petrol vehicles in the past decade. And diesel vehicles are the single biggest source of particulate matter. Moreover, laboratory analyses of diesel exhaust by the American Lung Association of California has revealed more than 40 toxic contaminants, of which 26 are carcinogenic."" Jhatkaa.org, which runs online campaigns on social and environmental issues, has started getting a petition signed by citizens of Kolkata to transport minister Suvendu Adhikari. The petition calls for banning registration of new diesel vehicles and phasing out old ones. ""The response, so far, has been quite phenomenal,"" said Shikha Kumar of Jhatkaa.org.As many as 99% of commercial vehicles in Kolkata are diesel-powered, figures released by the transport department show. A 2016 report by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) stated that diesel constitutes 45% of the city's total fuel consumption.But why is diesel so problematic? It's the high carbon content in it, because of which vehicles that run on it contribute much more to the suspended particulate matter of the air. This particulate matter is toxic: it causes lung damage and is responsible for many respiratory illnesses like asthma.How is it that Delhi - which has much more vehicles than Kolkata - is faring better?""Kolkata can learn a few things from Delhi,"" says Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of CSE. ""Delhi has banned diesel vehicle more than 10 years old. The cess imposed on diesel vehicles, worth a few hundred crores, is now being used in mitigation of pollution. The graded response action plans systematically and periodically follow protocols to take action against polluting units. The Badarpur power plant was shut because of this. Our latest study shows signs of improvement in Delhi's air quality.""Kolkatans are fed up of breathing poison. And their cry for the right to clean air is getting louder by the day. ""We are asking for a ban on registration of diesel vehicles. For years, the government has been hanging the carrot of CNG fuel for the entire diesel fleet of the city. No one knows when it will come. Unless you force a complete shutdown, nothing will change. As far as cleaner fuel is concerned, unlike Delhi, Kolkata has limited choices. The use of bio-diesel could reduce the emission level of each vehicle,"" says Ajay Mittal of Kolkata Clean Air, a community-led initiative to combat the growing concern of Kolkata's air quality.Controlling emission alone, however, might not be a foolproof solution for the city, which is fast becoming an airtight chamber because of shrinking open spaces and a dwindling green belt. The polluted air cannot disperse and new pollution has a piling-up effect on the ambient air. This winter, for example, the post-Diwali noxious air never really went away and continued to get worse, because massive real estate development has caused an alarming dip in the city's open spaces, a study by an environment advocacy group had pointed out.The study revealed that the city's open space - crucial for fast dispersal of pollutants from the air - had shrunk to an alarming 5.5% from around 13% of the city's total area because of extensive real estate development. According to World Health Organization (WHO) norms, a city must have at least 15% open space.In the study, conducted by Society for Environment and Development, it was learnt that Kolkata had slightly over 13% open space even in 2000. But the decline has been rapid over the next two decades or so.""Such decline has seriously affected the dispersal of polluted air and incursion of clean air. So, despite having lower vehicular density than Delhi or Bengaluru, Kolkata's pollution overtakes that of Delhi,"" says Somendra Mohan Ghosh, an auto-emission expert. ""And it is a vicious cycle. If vehicles receive poor air for burning fuel, there will be incomplete and inefficient burning that, again, will lead to higher emission.""Paradoxically, the number of parks in Kolkata had gone up to 600 from 290 in 2000. In reality, the study said, the new parks had been carved out of existing ones. But even those were badly encroached upon. Vivekanada Park, for instance, has a slum.With only 0.67sqm per person, Kolkata fares poorly on the open green space list as well. Planned cities across the world have 80sqm green space per person on an average. In India, Bengaluru has 17sqm, while Gandhinagar, at 162sqm, has the highest green space per dweller. The WHO recommendation is at least 9sqm per dweller.The vast open East Kolkata Wetlands not only acts as the sweeping basin for the city's waste water, but is also a dispersal zone for pollutants. Now that the openness of the wetlands has been fragmented by hundreds of constructions on either side of the EM Bypass, the polluted air has hardly any escape route, explained Sudipto Bhattacharya, an environmental scientist.In terms of total green cover, too, Kolkata is fast losing out. In comparison, the green cover in Delhi and Mumbai, at 19.09% and 18%, are much higher. The national average stands at 19.49% and Kolkata lags behind at 5.5%.""The erosion of greenery in the city has also led to a loss of biodiversity,"" says researcher Gauranga Adhikari. ""Along with birds that nest in them, trees also play host to bats, rhesus monkeys, palm civets and squirrels, which have been gradually disappearing from the city proper.""What added to the situation during this time, explained an environmentalist, was conservancy workers and street dwellers burning organic waste in the mornings.

"Lungs huff and puff hard as city air placed worst in south, 35th overall","Hyderabad: Breathing keeps on getting difficult in the city as Hyderabad records concentration of particulate matter count that is higher than the maximum level prescribed by government agencies. In fact, the city is worst placed among the southern cities when it comes to air quality.As per the Air Quality Index (AQI) bulletin generated by central pollution control board (CPCB) for 91 cities at 4pm on Saturday, air quality of Hyderabad was worse than cities like Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram, Tirupati, Visakhapatnam and Rajamahendravaram. Nationally, Hyderabad's air quality was worse than 34 other cities on the list.With AQI value of 105, Hyderabad came under the 'moderate' category of air quality. /If the AQI figures are under 'moderate' category, it means the air can cause breathing discomfort to people with asthma and heart disease. While industries do contribute a lot to air pollution levels in the city, the industrial areas are mostly restricted to the north-western part of the city and contribution of industries is nothing when compared to the pollution contributed by traffic, environmental experts said.""Air pollution in urban areas like Hyderabad is mostly due to construction activities and more number of vehicles being added to the city road on a daily basis. Everything else falls to a bare minimum in comparison to the pollution contributes by vehicles in Hyderabad,"" said Arun Krishnamurthy of Environmentalist Foundation of India (EFI).Hyderabad, including Secunderabad and Ranga Reddy districts, has a floating population of about 1 crore and has over 50 lakh vehicles plying on the roads with over 1,000 vehicles getting added every day to the existing vehicles. When contacted, officials at the Telangana state pollution control board (TSPCB) said the problem of air pollution is being viewed seriously and specific directions were being issued from time to time to check the pollution levels.However, experts say that the city's increasing traffic can pose a threat in the long run. ""Traffic congestion is known to be the major cause of air pollution. Residents may be affected in the long run if the numbers are not controlled,"" said N Raveender, former chief environmental scientist, TSPCB.On the brighter side, the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) is soon going to launch about 40 eco-friendly and noiseless electric buses from different parts of the city for passengers heading towards Shamshabad airport. According to TSRTC, the buses have already completed trial runs, undergone all safety tests and are ready to be deployed.""The trial runs were conducted successfully. We will soon launch 40 environment friendly buses to address the increasing air pollution problem in the city of Hyderabad,"" said M Ravinder, executive director of TSRTC.

Air purifier industry to touch $38.99 million by 2023: ASSOCHAM,"MANGALURU: Indian residential air purifiers market is projected to grow at a CAGR of more than 29% from the current level of $ 14.14 million to $ 38.99 million in 2023, backed by rapid urbanisation, increasing purchasing power, expanding urban population and deteriorating air quality, according to an ASSOCHAM-TechSci Research joint study.Some of the other key factors expected to drive the market are growing technological advancements, aggressive marketing strategies by air purifier companies, increasing incidences of airborne diseases and aspiration to lead a healthier lifestyle are anticipated to boost demand for air purifiers in India, noted ASSOCHAM-TechSci Research on 'Bio Medical Waste and air pollution'. The residential sector accounted for a revenue share of around 22% in the overall India air purifiers market in 2017, on account of increasing airborne disease in the country, due to rising air pollution. Rising air pollution, both outdoor as well as indoor, is solely responsible for increasing the number of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients resulting in a significant opportunity for air purifiers in the residential sector.The presence of high concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 in the air leads to high pollution levels in northern parts of India, especially Delhi NCR, which is among the most polluted regions in the country. As a result, demand for residential air purifiers from northern India is increasing, the joint study.In 2017, industrial air filters market stood at $ 293.27 million and is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 6.07% to cross $392.63 million by 2023. Also, the need for frequent replacement of air filters in the construction sector is spurring demand for air filters, noted the joint study.Sales of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) air filter segment witnessed high penetration in commercial sector in comparison to residential sector, thereby fuelling air filters market in India.Increasing construction activities including the establishment of buildings and townships in tier II cities, such as Varanasi, Amritsar and Ludhiana are deteriorating the air quality in these regions, thus demand for air purifiers is anticipated to grow at a robust pace from these regions in the coming years, said the study.Air pollution has become one of the biggest challenges for both developed economies. /It's even threatening the existence of the human race due to its effects like global warming and acid rain.Developing countries like India and China in Asia and the African continent will continue to contribute to a growing load of carbon emissions across the world. Thus, it becomes evident that both developed and developing economies need to come together on a common platform and join hands to fight this menace. Moreover, exchange of clean technologies from the developed world needs to be increased. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
High particulate matter levels recorded all 3 days,"KOCHI: A state-level monitoring committee, headed by justice (retd) A V Ramakrishna Pillai, has submitted a report to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on the fire that broke out at the Brahmapuram waste treatment plant.The report prepared by the regional centre of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) said the concentration of particulate matter (PM) exceeded health limits.The surveillance teams recorded PM 2.5 concentration as high as 200 microns per cubic metre on Saturday which is almost three times higher than the threshold limit of 60 while PM 10 levels were up to 250 microns per cubic metre, while the threshold limit was 100. The maximum levels were noted at the real-time monitoring stations at Vytilla and Ambalamedu. A look at the levels of PM 10 and PM 2.5 in the three days from Friday to Sunday showed the levels of PM 2.5 were the highest in the early hours of Sunday at 161 microns per cubic metre. The nitric oxide levels were 97.4 parts per billion (ppb) against the limit of 80 ppb.After the fire was doused, at 22.50 hours, the levels of PM 2.5 came down to 108 microns per cubic metre. /The methane levels were 2.3 parts per million. Doctors said PM, if inhaled, could result in inflammation and infection in the lung in the long term. ""Initially, it will cause irritation in nasal cavity, coughing and a runny nose. But it will aggravate pre-existing respiratory systems in asthmatics or people suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"" said Dr George Mothi, a senior pulmonologist in the city. He said patients with a history of asthma and respiratory problems from Irumbanam and Thiruvankulam had come for check-up. ""They had severe difficulty in breathing."" According to a WHO report on impact of air pollution on health, fine particulate matter travels down the airways and into the lungs. It could trigger inflammation, leading to shortness of breath.Pulmonologists in the city who met at the monthly meeting of the Cochin Thoracic Society, discussed the Brahmapuram fire and the different cases that were reported before them. ""There have been so many incidents of fire outbreak in the city and we are concerned over their impact on people's health,"" said Dr Ramesh Nair, president of the society. ""The impact of the smoke and the dust will be more marked on the elderly, children and pregnant women,"" said Dr Anitha Thilak, a city-based pulmonologist. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
45L vehicles in 12 hrs leave city gasping,"Kolkata: Nearly 3,750 vehicles are on the move per minute on city roads between 8am and 8pm, spewing a cocktail of killer gases and soot that has the city gasping for breath. This adds up to 27 lakh vehicles in half a day or 45,000 an hour with each emitting noxious fumes and fine particulate matter that sneak into our blood stream causing various ailments, including cancer. The high concentration of vehicles is made acute by the limited road length of 1,404 km, which accounts for barely 6% of the city's total area, with the majority being just two-lane roads. Of the nearly 3,750 vehicles, over 1,900 are in central Kolkata alone. /According to a recent vehicle density study by Kolkata Police, the average count in south Kolkata is 6 lakh, 13.7 lakh in central Kolkata and 7 lakh in north Kolkata.""Such a huge volume of emission from these vehicles has left the city gasping for breath in winter when particulate pollution peaks,"" said Kalyan Rudra, chairman, West Bengal Pollution Control Board, at a workshop on tracking Kolkata's rising air pollution on Thursday. As a way out, he suggested Kolkatans use public transport more to reduce their carbon footprint. The workshop was organised by Climate Trends and Legal Initiative for Forests and Environment.Going beyond the regular stations at Victoria Memorial, RBU campus and the US Consulate, the two environment groups had installed low cost monitoring devices at 4 city junctions to analyse the exposure levels of particulate matter. The data from these four devices -near National Medical College Hospital, Dunlop Crossing, Narayana Hospital and Silver Spring near EM Bypass - recorded between January 1 and February 24 shows zero 'good' air quality days in Kolkata and just one day of 'satisfactory' air quality across all four devices.While Dunlop Crossing readings ranged between ""very poor"" and ""severe"" on the air quality index, the area around Don Bosco school and EM Bypass ranged between ""poor"" and ""severe"", and readings near Narayana hospital remained around ""very poor"" on an average.While pollution levels escalate in the city, it is the inhabitants who pay the price. Dr Raja Dhar, director pulmonology at Fortis Hospital shared a worrying example. ""I recently had a 28-year-old patient, married two years ago and father of a 4-month-old son, diagnosed with lung cancer and won't survive more than a year. That's the image you need to remember when you think of air pollution. Innocent people with bright future ahead suffering from this disease due to no fault of theirs.""""In 1988, 10% non-smokers had lung cancer, in 2018, 50% non-smokers suffer from lung cancer. Average age of lung cancer has also gone down from 50-60 years to 30-40 years. In 1988, there were no female cases of lung cancer, today 40% of women's cancer cases are those of lung,"" said Dr Dhar.""Only 57 cities currently have real-time monitoring stations in the country, rest are manual that don't make data easily accessible for public consumption. While low cost monitors are not a replacement for the regulatory grade CPCB and state PCB monitors, these devices have helped democratise the data to start a public debate on rising threat of air pollution in many cities in India, and in Kolkata as well,' said Aarti Khosla, director, Climate Trends.Kolkata is one of the 102 non-attainment cities listed under the National Clean Air Programme. ""In West Bengal 90% of projects for environment impact assessment clearance are construction projects. We have an entire list of stipulations with a focus on air pollution, right from scaffolding to parking and the quality of roads around the project. But the crucial missing aspect is monitoring of these projects, which is managed by PCB which is strapped for staff and infrastructure,"" said Ujjwal Kumar Bhattacharya, chairman, State Environment Impact Assessment Authority.

Delhi: 58m mountain shrinks to 38m in 8 months,"NEW DELHI: No stench, absence of fires, toxic smoke or air pollution - these are the things that make it hard to believe that you are standing next to a landfill site at Ma Anandmayee Marg, Okhla. This is all thanks to 50-odd workers and eight excavators busy working in two shifts for the past eight months to execute the landfill remediation project prepared by IIT-Delhi.Recently, Indore had set an example before the country by clearing 13 lakh metric tonnes of waste at a landfill site in a mere six months. Taking a cue from this, the remediation and capping work of the 23-year-old sanitary landfill site at Okhla is now being carried out by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC). However, unlike Indore, Okhla will not be completely flattened.Tufail Ahmed, the consultant supervising the project, said, ""While the other two saturated landfill sites at Bhalswa and Ghazipur keep on getting dangerously high, Okhla has managed to reduce its height equivalent to a six-storey building from 58 metres to 38m.""Standing atop the mound, Ahmed explained the steps being undertaken by the yellow giant machines. ""It starts with excavation of zigzag unplanned landfill slopes. /The waste is pushed up and spread for proper aeration. Mining and turning around of waste is carried out 8-10 times, which turns most of the leftover organic material into dirt, thereby reducing the volume,"" he added.In the second step, remodelling is done using the end product based on the site plan made by IIT. ""The stabilisation plan involves making a 16m road around the landfill. Each slope is built at 22 degrees to ensure a Ghazipur-like collapse doesn't occur. The top surface is now so strong that even a helicopter can land on it,"" Ahmed said.Construction and demolition (C&D) waste is used to create the top layer. A soil cover is made over the stabilised slope and greening is done using grass and plants installed in drums. ""Grass will be planted by March-end. We will be using native Aravali species placed in giant drums or pipes for plantation to restrict the heat from the underlying material. Standard 'doob' grass will cover the slopes. We estimate that by the next monsoon the entire landfill will bear a green look,"" said the horticulture deputy director. At present, about 1,700 sq m area is ready for plantation and manure is being added to the top soil. Around 4,000 sq m would soon be ready for this purpose.The corporation had roped in Sri Ram Institute of Industrial Research to analyse the final product after the stabilisation process. ""It consists of 93.7% sand, earth, bricks, concrete, etc, 1.97% organic material, 3.77% plastic and only 0.5% glass/metals. By this method, the height has been reduced by about 30%,"" the report reads.SDMC commissioner Puneet Goel said that Indore's and Delhi's problems are incomparable. ""Indore had 13 lakh tonnes of garbage thrown over 100 acres, while Okhla has 55 lakh MT waste spread over 40 acres. Moreover, their proposals were very expensive. We decided to do an in-house process as private treatment would have cost Rs 550-600 per tonne. The in-house project costs just Rs 15-20 per tonne,"" he added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Mumbai: Harbour Line train halted for 25 minutes after fire near tracks,"NAVI MUMBAI: A Panvel-bound Harbour Line local train was delayed by 25 minutes at the Belapur CBD station due to a fire seen close to the tracks on Thursday afternoon. Central Railway personnel, as well as the local fire brigade, rushed to the site to extinguish the flames caused by the burning of dry grass along the railway line. Many commuters jumped out of the local which had arrived at Belapur station at 2.46pm, but could not proceed ahead for the next 25 minutes due to the fire.Recently, a similar delay was also noticed at Khandeshwar railway station along the Harbour Line due to a fire next to the tracks. ""Some miscreants often set the dry grass along the tracks on fire, leading to such problems. Some of the railway cleaning staff also set the garbage on fire close to the tracks, which is also a wrong thing to do as it causes smoke and air pollution,"" said a local city environmentalist.The CT train services were regularised after the fire at Belapur CBD was completely put off in the afternoon.

Economic cost of crop fires: Rs 2 lakh crore a year,"New Delhi: The economic cost of exposure to air pollution from stubble burning in north India has been pegged at $30 billion, or nearly Rs 2 lakh crore, annually for Punjab, Haryana and Delhi.Data related to this was published in a study unveiled on Monday by researchers from the US-based International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and partner institutes, which found that living in districts with air pollution caused from intense stubble burning has been a leading risk factor for acute respiratory infection, particularly in children less than five years.The study, Risk of acute respiratory infection from crop burning in India: estimating disease burden and economic welfare from satellite and national health survey data for 250,000 persons, has been co-authored by IFPRI's Samuel Scott and Avinash Kishore; CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health's Devesh Roy and University of Washington's Suman Chakrabarti.It estimates for the first time the health and economic cost of stubble burning in northern India and found that this led to an estimated economic loss of over $30 billion annually.""The levels of airborne particulate matter in Delhi on certain days spiked to 20 times the World Health Organization's safety threshold. Among other factors, smoke from the burning of agricultural crop residue in Haryana and Punjab, especially contributed to Delhi's poor air, increasing the risk of acute respiratory infection by threefold for those living in the districts with intense crop burning,"" Scott said.The study, which will be published in the upcoming edition of the International Journal of Epidemiology, analyses the health data from over 250,000 individuals of all ages residing in rural and urban areas in India. /It uses NASA satellite data on fire activity to estimate the health impact of living in areas with intense stubble burning by comparing them with areas not affected by it.The researchers observed that as stubble burning increased in Haryana, respiratory health worsened. Health was measured by the frequency of reported hospital visits for acute respiratory infection symptoms. In five years, the economic loss due to burning of crop residue and firecrackers was estimated to be $190 billion, or nearly 1.7% of India's GDP, they said.""Severe air pollution during winter months has led to a public health emergency. Stubble burning will add to the pollution and increase healthcare costs over time if immediate steps are not taken,"" said Chakrabarti, adding that the negative health effects will also lower the productivity of residents and may lead to a long-term adverse impact on the economy and health.Kishore from IFPRI explained that, ""It is not only the residents of Delhi, but those in rural Haryana are also the first victims of stubble burning. Much of the public discussion on its ill-effects ignores this immediately affected vulnerable population."" The study suggests that targeted government initiatives to improve crop disposal practices are worthy investments, researchers claimed.The researchers noted that stubble burning has been a widespread global practice, and in India, is concentrated in northwest and has spread to other regions in the past decade.

"Economic cost of crop fires in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi Rs 2 lakh crore a year","PATIALA: Stubble burning is costing Punjab, Haryana and Delhi over Rs 2 lakh crore annually besides putting the residents, especially children, at threefold risk of getting respiratory diseases. These are the findings of a detailed study conducted by the US-based International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The findings also put the economic loss due to the burning of crop residue and firecrackers in these states in the next five years at an estimated 1.7 % of the country's GDP.It is for the first time that researchers have calculated the economic and health cost of stubble burning, which is perceivably the major cause of air pollution in the two northern states and the national capital region (NCR).In a statement, IFPRI research fellow and co-author of the study, ""Risk of acute respiratory infection from crop burning in India: estimating disease burden and economic welfare from satellite and national health survey data for 250,000 persons"", Samuel Scott, said poor air quality has been recognized as a global public health epidemic, and on certain days, the levels of airborne particulate matter in Delhi have been found to be 20 times the World Health Organization (WHO) safety threshold.More crop fires lead to more respiratory problems: StudyThe study, co-authored by number of experts along with Samuel, has been featured in the International Journal of Epidemiology. /The study has used NASA satellite data on fire activity to estimate the health impact on those living in areas with intense crop burning by comparing them with areas not affected by stubble burning.The researchers have concluded that as crop fires increase in the northern state of Punjab and Haryana, so do respiratory problems of residents. The researchers have measured the health impact by the frequency of reported hospital visits for respiratory problems. The study has also examined factors, including pollution caused by the firecrackers during Diwali and motor vehicle density in the target areas.The study says that the economic cost of exposure to air pollution from firecrackers has been estimated to be around nearly Rs 50,000 crores a year. Calling for immediate steps to stall stubble burning, Suman Chakrabarti from the University of Washington, who is one of the co-authors of the report, said there is a health emergency in the northern states in the winter and long-term exposure to air pollution will lower productivity of residents and may further aggravate economic losses. The study found that crop-burning abatement would be highly cost-effective and, in northern India, would avert disability-adjusted life years equivalent to US$152.9 billion over a 5-year period. However, according to the findings, farmers continue to burn crop residues due to lack of convenient and affordable alternatives. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Out on streets, they are in harm's way","New Delhi: A study is being conducted to find out the impact of air pollution on the people living on the city streets. IIT Delhi, University of Birmingham and All India Disaster Mitigation Institute are carrying out 'Vulnerability Scoping Study: Air Pollution Exposure of Pavement Dwellers in Delhi', for which initial samples have been collected from the busy roads at IIT-D in south Delhi and Ghazipur in the east.According to professor Francis Pope, University of Birmingham, foul air impacts the people on the streets the most. ""In Delhi, we have been looking at the street-dwelling communities. /They never go inside by definition and, therefore, have the highest exposure. You will be hard-pressed to find another group which is more affected by air pollution,"" Pope told TOI on the sidelines of a workshop here. 'Tackling the Challenges of Urban Air Pollution - Linking Research and Policy for Air Quality Improvement' discussed how cities can better understand and address challenges posed by air pollution.In Delhi, the sources of PM2.5 air pollution are vehicular emission, biomass burning and industry, soil and road dust, diesel generators, open waste burning, power plants and those originating from outside the urban airshed. Pavement dwellers are mostly exposed to vehicular emission and sources of cooking, heating and lighting.According to professor Mukesh Khare, IIT Delhi, this is a marginalised section that is not getting any attention from any government. ""Delhi has 900,000 street dwellers, according to the 2011 census. A one-day initial study shows their exposure to be as high as 800 microgram per cubic metre,"" Khare said. ""Most of them are migrant construction workers and we need to take care of their health."" Their vulnerability is increased by higher rates of underlying disease, greater exposure due to residence in high-risk urban areas and poorer protection from the elements, said another expert. ""Those who are less exposed get more anti-pollution measures and those who are most exposed get the least. It is injustice which governments need to look into,"" said Mihir Bhatt, director, All India Disaster Mitigation Institute. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Why Gurugram ranking doesn't surprise chief of apex pollution control body,"GURUGRAM: A study carried out by IQ Air AirVisual and Greenpeace has ranked Gurugram as the most polluted city in the country and the world for the second year running.Even though the city's score improved slightly in 2018 from that in 2017, it remained the world's most polluted in both years. The city's average annual PM2.5 concentration was measured at 135.8 micrograms per cubic metre (g/m) in 2018, lower than that recorded in 2017, which was 145.6g/m. The annual permissible limit for PM2.5 in India is 40g/m, which itself is higher than WHO's annual permissible limit of 10g/m.""Although Delhi typically receives most media coverage as one of the world's 'pollution capitals', it actually ranked 10th in annual PM2.5 concentration. Other cities across North India and Pakistan recorded a higher annual PM2.5 level, with nearby Gurugram recording the highest annual concentration of any global city during 2018,"" states the study.The study's Global City Ranking shows the average monthly concentration of PM2.5 in March, May, June, August, October and December of 2018 was higher than corresponding figures in 2017. In the remaining six months of 2018, PM2.5 fell from the corresponding figures of 2017.Ghaziabad was the world's second most polluted city, with average annual concentration of PM2.5 at 135.2g/m - marginally lower than Gurugram. /Next came Faisalabad in Pakistan, Faridabad in Haryana, Bhiwadi in Rajasthan, Noida in UP, Patna in Bihar, Lucknow in UP and Lahore in Pakistan. With an average yearly concentration of PM2.5 at 113.5g/m, Delhi ranked 10th in the world, but was still the world's most polluted capital city. EPCA officials blamed civic authorities and Haryana State Pollution Control Board for not taking enough measures. ""We've warned Haryana authorities to take adequate measures. We've defined measures for all areas, including controlling waste burning, construction dust, waste dumping, etc. However, I have no hesitation in saying state authorities have failed in implementing these measures,"" said EPCA chief Bhure Lal.Experts at Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said inadequate number of air monitoring stations in Gurugram has led to the poor rank. ""We can't compare a city with two air monitoring systems - one of which is located away from the city - with cities like Delhi, which has 32 stations. Therefore, Gurugram first needs to have air monitoring stations at all traffic junctions, populated areas and congested areas,"" said Dipankar Saha, a former head of air pollution monitoring at CPCB. He added, ""Also, since Gurugram is located to Delhi's south-west and is closer to Rajasthan's deserts - with the buffer zone (Aravalis) getting depleted, NCR's protection from sandstorms arriving from the Thar is falling - increasing pollution in Gurugram the most.""Some raised concerns about lack of mechanism to keep a check on violations of construction norms, dumping of garbage in the open, and depletion of green cover. ""Gurugram is one of India's fastest developing cities. Due to unabated construction and other development activities, pollution in the city is naturally scaling upwards. The city is also a start-up hub, which brings working people to travel from neighbouring areas, increasing vehicular pollution, especially during rush hours,"" said Rohit Bansal, an AQI expert.Doctors said cases of respiratory diseases have risen sharply in the last decade. ""In 2009, when the first pulmonology unit in a big hospital was opened, we used to get few patients. Today, the number has risen by almost 100%, largely because the city has been continuously expanding for the last 20 years. In each of our community outreach programmes, we have reported 30% new cases of respiratory illness. But instead of taking preventive measures like protecting green belts and reducing diesel emissions, authorities are taking curative measures like introducing corporate hospitals and robotic surgery,"" said Dr Himanshu Garg, senior pulmonologist at W Pratiksha Hospital.

Air pollution can cause Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases: Experts,"Nagpur: Not just respiratory diseases, the rising air pollution is responsible for many severe health ailments like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases too.The revelation took place during the country's first-of-its-kind dialogue series on 'Clean Air: Healthy Cities', which was held by global organization Clean Air Asia in the city on Friday. The discussions at the event, which saw national as well as local experts including doctors, scientists, civic authorities and environmentalists participating, aimed at highlighting a road map for tackling health crisis emerging due to pollution.Stating that its menace was not restricted to lungs, former assistant director of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute Dr Manas Ranjan Ray stated that air pollution is causing various mental health problems. ""After being deposited in the lungs, the inhaled pollutants can enter the bloodstream and attack the brain, which consumes almost 50% of the oxygen we breathe. /This can lead to depression, anxiety, dementia and other neurological diseases,"" he said.Diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are on a rise due to pollution, stated city pulmonologist Dr Sameer Arbat. ""Enough evidences suggest that pollution is also leading to various heart-related diseases,"" he said. Presenting latest data from Chandrapur, one of the country's most toxic city, environment activist Yogesh Dudhpachare said that out of 5,540 deaths (2016-17), 1.046 were caused due to respiratory diseases. ""Residents of Chandrapur have been suffering miserably due to pollution from last 15 years. The action plans to combat air pollution are not being implemented at the government level,"" said Suresh Chopane, founder of NGO Green Planet Society.He added that the ambient air quality monitoring stations are not installed at the right places, considering the wind direction. Another critical issue that triggered a debate was the new coal-fired units coming up at Koradi Thermal Power Station (KTPS) and its effect on public health. TOI recently reported that the state cabinet cleared Mahagenco's proposal to set-up two 660 megawatt units at KTPS. Questioning the move, members of Green Vigil Foundation stated that the project will add to the already-high emission levels of the city.KV George, senior scientist at the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, explained the effects of pollution generated from thermal power sector. ""During post monsoon and winters, the wind from Koradi and Khaparkheda power stations is flowing pre-dominantly towards Nagpur while in summers, its direction is towards Kamptee. To assess the pollution, air quality monitoring stations should be set-up in Kamptee during summers and in the main city during winters,"" he said. The consultation concluded with recognizing a need to consider public health as a key factor when framing policies related to air quality improvement. ""It is crucial to discuss health implications as central topic when we talk about air pollution. It is the link which will motivate people to rise up for their right to clean air as well as will help institutions and organizations be more aggressive in taking appropriate actions,"" said Prarthana Borah, India director of Clean Air Asia.

From stubble to tableware: Cos turn burning problem into business,"NEW DELHI: Punjab has 75 lakh acres of land under paddy cultivation. Every October after the harvest, these vast fields are left with crop residue, also known as stubble or straw, which farmers usually burn to prepare their fields for the wheat crop. The smoke ends up choking Delhi and other parts of north India. /But now some firms are not only turning crop waste into money but also saving lungs in the process.Farm2Energy Pvt Ltd, a three-year-old business based in Ludhiana's Bija village, is run by two farmer brothers, Sukhbir and Kamljeet Singh. Its balers and tractors scoop up the stubble, roll it into bales and sell it to neighbouring sugar, cement and oil factories as well as power plants who burn these in a controlled environment to fire boilers.At the Bio-lutions factory in Ramnagara, Bengaluru, eight machines convert three tonnes of paddy straw from Punjab into pulp every day. The pulp is then used to manufacture sustainable tableware and packaging material. Nitin Jain, chief financial officer of Farm2Energy, says, ""Since we started in 2016, we have cleared straw from 20,000 acres of farmland in Punjab. ""We also make bio-coal from crop stubble and plan to monetise it from the next financial year."" The stubble business is already showing an operating profit, says the CFO.Three tonnes of straw processed in the Bengaluru factory is just a fraction of the rice straw generated in Punjab but it's a beginning, says Kurian Mathew, CEO, Bio-lutions India. ""With multiple plants we will hopefully reduce crop residue burning as well as the use of single-use plastic,"" says Mathew. The company produces plates, bowls, trays to pack vegetables in supermarkets and kidney trays used in hospitals.In Delhi, a bunch of engineers and scientists have floated a company to tackle the issue. Operating from the IIT campus, Kriya Labs is running a pilot unit which breaks down agricultural residue to pulp, which can be used to make tableware. Ankur Kumar, CEO, Kriya Labs says, ""We purchased 500kg of paddy straw at Rs 5/kg, and our current facility can produce 50kg of pulp a day. Later this year, we'll be starting our first commercial facility in Ludhiana which will produce five tonnes of pulp per day using 7.5-8 tonnes of straw.""Interestingly, Kumar and his colleagues developed this project by chance. In 2015, as part of the college curriculum, they were working on a machine to recycle paper. At the time, air pollution was making headlines in Delhi, so they decided to tweak their project and develop a machine to convert agricultural straw into pulp. While the pilot unit is being funded by the government, they are in talks with investors. ""Pollution is a pressing issue and investors are willing to put money,"" Kumar adds.If these companies do succeed commercially, it will mean relief for residents of North India who have to deal with acute respiratory disorders due to air pollution. A recent study by the US-based International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and partner institutes has estimated that the health and economic costs of crop burning in northern India amount to over $30 billion annually.

"Doctors below 40 coming down with heart diseases, says Jayadeva director","Mysuru: Citing the dozen cases of doctors aged below 40 being treated at the Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, Mysuru, the director of the hospital's Bengaluru unit Dr CN Manjunath on Friday expressed grave concerns about rising levels of stress among modern-day medical professionals and the ill-effects of the workload on their health.Adducing studies that confirmed a reduction in lifespan of doctors by 10 years, Dr Manjunath said, ""Their duties are taking a toll on health. We have treated doctors, among whom there are nephrologists and general physicians for heart diseases.""The senior doctor ascribed the near-inhuman stress levels that doctors had to contend with to some of the unnatural expectations of patients and public. ""Kin of patients sometimes expect even dead bodies to rise, and walk again. /Doctors also have to deal with rumour-mongering on social media. Besides stress, air pollution, sedentary lifestyle and stress are some of the latest causes leading to cardiovascular diseases in India,"" said Manjunath.Pointing to the rise in cardiovascular diseases among the general populace the world over, Dr Manjunath said that, while the prevalence of such heart disorders was limited to 2% of the global population at the time of its discovery in the 1960s, the percentage had risen by four or five times recently. ""Lifestyle diseases account for 50% of fatalities in the world every year. What is even more alarming is the number of patients below 40 diagnosed with heart diseases,"" he added.Pointing to Jayadeva Hospital getting accreditation from the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH), Dr Manjunath proudly said doctors at the Mysuru hospital had thus far performed 80 open-heart surgeries, and achieved a success rate of 99%. ""We have effectively implemented the 'Treatment first, Payment next' concept at our centres since most of the patients who come to Jayadeva are from underprivileged sections of society. Meanwhile, members of SC/ST communities are getting benefits of up to Rs 1 lakh,"" he added.On the merger of Ayushman Bharat and Arogya Karnataka schemes, Manjunath said that Karnataka's contribution was more than twice to that of the central government.Meanwhile, Canara Bank on Friday donated an ICU ambulance to Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research Campus as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative.Dr Manjunath, meanwhile, allayed any fears over chief minister HD Kumaraswamy's health.

Health impact of losing tree cover never considered,"A tree is not planted for oneself, it's planted for posterity. We do not inherit earth from our ancestors but borrow it from our future generations. However, the most intellectual creatures to walk the planet Earth, 'humans' appear to be the most careless about their surrounding environment.Since Hippocrates wrote 'On Airs, Waters and Places', the natural environment has been viewed as an important determinant of human health. /MahaMetro's revised plan proposing the alternative road around Futala lake may incur unnecessary loss of around 500 trees to facilitate constructions of a temporary road passing through Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth's lush green patch. This move will significantly damage Nagpur's last few remaining biodiverse hotspots. The human health impact of eco system alterations is a vital consideration and must not be overlooked while urban planning, especially for short term goals. Development at the cost of environment poses serious health implications which must not be overlooked.Being one of the fastest growing cities, Nagpur has seen a deluge of developmental activities in recent times. More often than not, such development is accompanied by loss of tree cover and promises of re-plantation. But, do such assurances materialize is a question that remains unanswered. This lays further emphasis on the need to re-evaluate the decision about meddling with green cover in question to avoid further damage to ecology and inadvertently human health.The empirical data aside, common knowledge about disadvantages of deforestation is being overlooked by the planning authorities. Role of trees and plants in absorbing CO2 and releasing oxygen via photosynthesis is taught to pupils from primary school curriculum but this familiar fact often gets ignored while justifying urban development.One of the most concerning issues emerging from loss of tree cover is the drop in air quality and rise of resulting respiratory diseases. The recently held Clean Air: Healthy cities dialogue series in Nagpur highlighted that its not just respiratory diseases but rising air pollution may lead to severe aliments such as cardiac disorders, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's too. The inhaled pollutants may enter the blood stream and thus reach brain and increase the chances of neurological diseases as well. The green area reduces atmospheric temperature and arrests pollutants and dust. Destruction of tree cover causes rapid release of stored carbon and further adds to drop in air quality. Empirical data further adds that displacement of insects, rodents birds from such ecological areas increases both, their interactions with humans and the chances of diseases caused and spread by animal carriers. Interruptions of streams in area and exposure to sun light creates puddles of warm water that are ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes and thus increasing the chances of various mosquito borne diseases.Simply put, trees help in controlling the air pollution. Trees and forests have beneficial effects on the environment. They conserve biodiversity, protect soils and watersheds and act as a carbon sink. Loss of tree cover on the other hand results in deleterious effects on the environment. The best-known disadvantages are those attributed to the poor air quality and increased temperatures. Loss of biodiversity areas also results in habitat changes, which affect disease vectors and parasites resulting in a change in disease incidences.(The writer is assistant professor of oral medicine and radiology) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
22 districts to get air-quality monitoring stations,"Bengaluru: With air quality deteriorating alarmingly not only in Bengaluru, but also other parts of Karnataka, the state government has sanctioned funds to install Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) in 22 of the 30 districts in the state.The step has been taken to study and maintain data on air quality and initiate interventions whenever quality plummets.In its order, the state government has sanctioned Rs 72.6 crore for installation of 32 CAAQMS in 22 districts. Eleven CAAQMS will be installed at Kalaburagi, Ballari, Chitradurga, Bagalkot and Koppal, with an investment of Rs 25.3 crore by the respective district mineral foundations (Zilla Khanija Pratishtana). Stations in the remaining 17 districts will be set up with Rs 48.3 crore from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB). According to the order, the stations should be operational within a year, said Balachandirama G Hunashal, under-secretary (environment and ecology). Officials said air quality monitoring is done manually in most parts of the state and the data obtained aren't accurate. The proposal to set up CAAQMS was sent specially to find the effects of rampant mining, which leads to several breathing disorders and diseases. /The stations will be set up in major mining areas of Ballari, Hospet, Sandur and Harapanahalli.A comptroller and auditor general (CAG) of India report revealed that indiscriminate iron ore mining in Ballari district was leading to diseases like tuberculosis (TB) and other respiratory disorders among locals.Steps have been taken to study suspended particulate matter (SPM) and respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in different parts of the state and to analyse the sources which contribute to air pollution to come up with remedial measures to tackle the menace, said the order. The proposal was made by KSPCB following an alarming dip in air quality across the state. Not just vehicles, construction debris, industries, burning of garbage, mining and unscientific discharge of chemical effluents are prime sources of air pollution across the state and it is seemingly increasing over the years, said the office of the principal secretary (environment and ecology).

These streets will make you HAPPY on Sunday,"Ranchi: Morhabadi Maidan, one of Ranchi's well-known centres where five chief ministers have so far taken the oath of office, will witness a festival of fitness and fun activities with the launch of Happy Streets, an initiative of The Times of India, on the street adjacent to the historic ground on Sunday.From 6.30 am to 9. 30 am, the two-way road from near the CBI Office Roundabout to the Birsa Munda Football Stadium will be restricted for motorized traffic and will become Happy Streets for Ranchiites to skate, jog, meditate, practice yoga, cycle, dance, play cricket and soccer or walk around with their loved ones. People from all walks of life can visit and attend the events, besides taking part in the fitness and health promotional events brought to Ranchi by The Times of India.The objective of the event is to reclaim streets by promoting non-motorized transport as an alternative to pollution-causing automobiles. Cycling enthusiasts attending the event need not bring in their own bicycles as they can get them by showing their copy of The Times of India, which they can carry from home or they can buy it from stalls. /They will have to return the bicycles after the event and can carry their copies of The Times of India back home.Happy Streets is an event that provides citizens with the opportunity to reclaim their streets to create awareness and promote non-motorized transport for an environment friendly atmosphere in the city. The event aims at raising awareness about healthy living and improving community interaction. It will encourage citizens of all age groups to come out and relax on the streets that are usually filled with noisy, smoke-belching vehicles.Happy Streets received warm response from citizens wherever it was held earlier, be it Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Pune, Coimbatore, Ahmedabad and Patna. All this has encouraged us to organise the event for our readers in Ranchi. Ranchi (city) SP Sujata Veenapani describes Happy Streets as ""a welcome move that will help in promoting the use of non-motorized transport."" She believes that a event like this will not only bring down the number of motorized vehicles but will also play an important role in checking air pollution in the state capital. Residents in Ranchi are, too, enthusiastically waiting for Happy Streets. ""This is truly a new concept. It will surely encourage community participation and promote health awareness. People will get a chance to exchange their ideas about healthy living,"" remarks Rashmi Dubey, a Ranchi-based mathematics teacher.""These days, we hardly see kids play outdoor games. They look more interested in playing PUBG on their smartphones. Happy Streets will certainly will bring everybody out and play outdoor games in a healthy atmosphere,"" hopes Harshita Mishra, a dentist.Akanksha Jha, a final-year medical student, adds, ""We are really excited about Happy Streets.

It's the one source of clean energy the country can tap. Yet it remains unaccountably underexploited. Back in 2016, the Haryana government made it mandatory for new residential construction of at least 500 square yards to install solar rooftop panels with a minimum capacity of 1KW. And, to encourage more people to go solar, the administration offered subsidies as high as 30% of the benchmark cost. /But for all these incentives, only 600 consumers have applied for the subsidy in the last three years, among them schools, colleges and resident welfare associations (RWAs), and a few individuals. Out of these, just 107 have benefited from the subsidy in the last three years. In 2018, only 12 consumers were given subsidy for installation of solar rooftop panels. The figures for 2017 and 2016 were 92 and three, respectively. And last year, just one government building switched to solar energy. According to the authorities, 250 consumers have changed to solar without applying for subsidies, but most of these are commercial setups. Nevertheless, total solar power generation currently stands at 25.5MW, around 1.5% of the overall power demand - 1,600MW - during peak summer. Clearly, the state government's target of adding 4,000MW in solar energy by 2021 looks unlikely to be achieved. WHERE'S THE EASE OF ACCESS?Extending subsidies is nowhere near enough, consumers argue. For, getting one in the first place is a cumbersome procedure, not helped by a lack of net meters and steep installation costs. ""Haryana has definitely taken a lead in offering high subsidies to residential consumers for installing solar panels. However, there is a need to streamline the entire process,"" says Shubhra Puri of Gurgaon First, a citizen-led initiative that seeks to promote a shift to solar energy in the city.The subsidy, Puri feels, should be given directly after installation, to factor in the high cost of setting up. ""But this takes a very long time, sometimes one to two years. Also, unavailability of net meters with DHBVN (Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam, the state-owned electric utility company) is a major issue. All this makes the entire process of applying, procuring and installing solar panels long and expensive.""TOI reached out to four consumers - three individuals and an RWA - to understand the pros and cons of going solar and the challenges this entails. Those who got it done through a vendor faced fewer hurdles but it proved far more of a hassle for residents who applied for subsidy and completed the installation all on their own. Although the vendor route proved the user-friendliest, the authorities advise against such a course of action. But Prashant Behki was guided by a vendor every step of the way. And Behki, a resident of D-block in Sushant Lok-1, has no reason to complain, for he has been able to bring down his power expenses by a staggering 98%. In fact, his bills are now showing in minus, allowing him to earn money by exporting the solar power he is generating to the grid. ""This has been the wisest decision of my life,"" he says with pride. Three months after applying, his subsidy was sanctioned and the system installed. After another five months, he got possession of the net meter. Today, Behki's household of 12, including three domestic helps, uses 20 air-conditioners, each of two tonnes, and centralised water-filtration and water-heating systems. All this adds up to a daily load of between 40KW and 60KW, depending on the season. It's as strong an argument for solar as any. For Geeta Kapil, though, it has been a struggle. The solar rooftop system this Sector 56 resident purchased in November 2017 took roughly five months to be fitted. ""I was told the quota for the year 2017 was over. I had to wait until next year. After so many pleadings, it was finally installed in April 2018,"" she said. Kapil, who had to put up with a delay of a year and a half, has a 3.9KW system that set her back Rs 2.3 lakh. Jagdish Singh, a resident of Sector 31, has a similar tale of exasperation. His investment is gathering dust. ""I got the solar system installed in May 2018, but I haven't got a net meter yet. Solar panels are lying on my rooftop as junk. I met senior officials of HAREDA (Department of Renewable Energy, Government of Haryana), who said that net meters would come soon but nothing has happened till now,"" said an unhappy Singh, whose 15KW system cost Rs 8 lakh. It's not just individual consumers who have noticed, to their evident dissatisfaction, the too-wide gap between promise and delivery. Units that generate much more solar power are facing analogous issues. The Wellington Estate RWA, for instance. This township in DLF Phase-5 claims it saved Rs 25 lakh on the electricity bill in 2018. But it is still awaiting the subsidy despite both phases of installation having been completed, the first in 2017 and the second recently. ""Till now, we have spent about Rs 2 crore on installation of solar rooftop panels. However, we have not got any subsidy yet,"" revealed Ajay Jain from the Wellington RWA. ""We have taken up the matter with all the concerned departments, including local officials, the CM window and even the PMO, but nothing has helped.""LITTLE COORDINATION, PLENTY OF CONFUSIONRameshwar Singh, project officer at HAREDA, acknowledges that there could be a time lag before consumers see the money. ""Subsidies coming from the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) go to the state, and are then given to HAREDA - sometimes, it takes time at the ministry level to release subsidies,"" he reasoned. Singh maintains that the state department of renewable energy hasn't stopped receiving subsidies, which it has subsequently issued to some applicants. Still, those who have applied must account for the multiplicity of agencies (a uniquely Gurgaon problem), which invariably leads to lack of coordination and plenty of confusion. While HAREDA is tasked with addressing the technical concerns of consumers, and issuing certificates after successful installation of rooftop panels, DHBVN is the implementing agency for providing net meters and making them operational (besides managing the bi-directional meters).Worryingly, it appears that employees at the discom are insufficiently unprepared for the switchover to solar. ""I have not received any bill since October last year. I have met a junior engineer at DHBVN to raise concern but was told they don't have trained people to compute the bills in the case of net meters,"" Kapil said. Incidentally, there are three types of solar rooftop systems - grid-connected, off-grid and hybrid. Though each has its positives and negatives, the grid-linked one is the most regularly used (see infographic). But only the hybrid system allows both storage of solar energy in batteries and export of excess power to the grid. Not surprisingly, it comes at a cost - between Rs 80,000 and Rs 85,000 per kilowatt, depending on the kind of battery used. ""That is why not many people go for such a system. I have not got the hybrid system installed anywhere in Gurgaon since 2016,"" said AN Bhat, a solar-panel vendor. But vendors, feel experts, are reluctant to promote the hybrid system, and are not beyond hoodwinking prospective customers. ""The hybrid systems are not very costly but some vendors misinform consumers,"" says Priyavat Bhati, adviser, energy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). ""The hybrid systems only require batteries that are used in conventional inverters, and these batteries are as costly as the ones used in conventional invertors. They only cost more if consumers demand high loads even during power outage,"" she adds. All too often, then, residents eager to change over to solar are left in the lurch because of lack of clarity.GOODBYE DIESEL? NOT REALLYGoing solar might have helped reduce the carbon footprint a tad but it has done little to bring down usage of gensets. And that's because the grid-linked solar scheme which consumers are using doesn't provide for power back-up, making gensets the only fallback option. Further, each time the power goes, solar generation also shuts down, necessitating the use of gensets to run the solar panels. So, reduction in air pollution in the immediate vicinity is actually negligible. ""The purpose of installing solar panels to bring down air pollution is defeated as grid-tied systems don't lead to reduction in the usage of diesel gensets,"" explains Bhati.Indeed, a study carried out by CSE in 2018 showed that pollution levels increase by 30% in areas of the city where gensets are used. ""Using diesel gensets is like putting smoke into your own house - we can't blame anyone but ourselves for the air pollution caused by gensets,"" she adds. It's obvious that when it comes to making solar a worthwhile investment for residents, a fair few practicalities need to be ironed out. As it stands, the changeover exercise is too protracted and inconvenient for it to be widely accepted. Meanwhile, HAREDA officials insist the intention behind introducing solar is to shrink the carbon footprint. ""While synchronisation of solar rooftop panels with power back-up systems is possible, it can't replace diesel generators completely,"" contends Rameshwar Singh. ""The idea is to reduce carbon footprints by generating more solar power, to decrease the use of thermal power plants.""Certainly, Gurgaon (and Delhi-NCR) has great potential for producing solar power. The Millennium City records around 330 sunny days every year, has solar radiation of a high intensity, and, besides, can boast of many highrise buildings. There are, here, approximately 30,000 plots measuring 500 square yards or more, some 900 highrises and around 5,000 commercial entities. So, if the hybrid system is pushed, it is entirely likely that usage of diesel gensets will fall dramatically. But, just as the Earth takes 365 days to orbit around the sun, it will take that much time (and then some more) to win more converts to the solar cause. And for that to happen, the authorities must work to remove the impediments to a clean-energy future. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Smart Surat struggling to breathe easy,"Surat: Toxic fumes released by the high number of vehicles everyday, coupled with the smoke from dyeing and printing units, is turning the air around Surat city's commercial areas unbreathable. The city, mainly those parts under industrial segments, are forced to survive in an atmosphere polluted with suspended particulate matter (PM) 2.5 mm and PM 10 mm, said GPCB officials.With a population count of more than 50 lakh, Surat city - the eighth-most populated city of the country at present - has 31 lakh vehicles of all sizes and 5,000 km roads. With Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) continuously monitoring the levels of air pollution at 10 different spots round the year, the city has fallen from its earlier 'good' position owing to the dip in its air quality to 'moderately polluted' category according to National Air Quality Index (AQI) . Experts fear that if the pollution continues to grow at this rate it will take less than 3 years for the city to reach 'poor' to 'very poor' levels as per AQI standards. /Surat's phenomenal rise in vehicular population - addition of 1.5 million vehicles in a decade - is the root cause of deterioration in air quality. Recently, the World Bank officials too expressed their fears on the rising pollution levels, especially PM10mg |M3 and PM2.5 mg|M3, in the city. Dr Namrata Jariwala, an expert in pollution and environment issues from Sardar Vallbhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT), however, does not blame vehicles alone for the pollution. ""Apart from increase in number of vehicles, there is also the emissions from industrial units for the fuel type they use,"" she said. When compared to highly polluted cities like Delhi, Surat too has high pollution levels that is visible from a filter paper turning black in two hours even at spots like Piplod, she explained. ""However, what helps Surat still breathe easy is its climatic conditions. In winter such pollutants can cause eye irritation or running nose or throat infection but apart from local irritants, we do not feel higher impact of pollution. Compared to hot places like Delhi, we live in 10-15 degree Celsius which helps pollutants to disperse easily,"" she said.Parag Dave, regional officer at GPCB, Surat, said, ""Ongoing construction activity, demolition work sites, bigger project sites, vehicle emissions are some of the things that increase pollutants in air along with hydrocarbon emissions due to different types of machines. We need to control such construction activities along with number of vehicles plying in residential areas of the city.""  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Suman dust absorbing trees in New Town,"Kolkata: In an effort to minimise dust pollution in New Town, the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has given a list of dust-absorbing plants and trees to the forest department to plant before the coming monsoon.The authorities are also in touch with a German company to install a 'Fine Dust Eater' machine, which is an eight-feet stationary tower that absorbs fine dust from air.Officials said the authorities have been trying to eradicate dust and air pollution by sowing special plants.The NKDA has already submitted a list of 21 different trees and saplings, over 3,000 in number, that can considered good for pollution absorption.The list include trees, like shirish, bel, jhau, bakul, kadam, palas and neem. While some of them are suitable to be planted by the roads, others will be planted in parks and gardens. Officials said the trees should be planted with a mix of two or three varieties on different avenues. /Sources said the soil mix for planting such trees should have coco peat, paddy husk and sand. The 'Fine Dust Eater' machine, assisted with German technology, will be installed in New Town Action Area 1 on an experimental basis after the elections.  Part of a pilot project, the machine is an eight-foot, three-cube stationary tower that will take away the fine dust from air with the help of the cubes. The machine consists of special filters, IoT devices and rain sensors.The NKDA have also been planning to install sensor-based air quality monitoring units in different points of New Town for some time. NKDA authorities have been working on a number of initiatives to minimise dust and air pollution in New Town. Open green areas are being developed and dust-proof pavements are being set up by the authorities. Smoke belching hot-mix plants are being removed and awareness programmes on clean and green city are being held with a target of zero solid waste, starting with segregation of solid wastes at source.

"Fire in Meghmani's Dahej plant, two killed","Surat/Bharuch: Two persons were charred to death and eight others critically injured in a massive fire that broke out in Meghmani Organics pesticides plant in Dahej.The fire broke out after explosions in the cypermethrin plant of Meghmani's unit three of agrochemical division plant on Tuesday morning. A major part of cypermethrin plant within the complex was badly damaged. More than 10 fire tenders from Hindalco, Grasim, GACL, OPAL, Reliance, and Bharuch municipality along with Disaster Management & Prevention Centre, Ankleshwar took them more than 10 hours to control the blaze. /cypermethrin is used as an insecticide in large-scale commercial agricultural applications. Two workers who suffered severe burn injuries died during treatment whereas eight were shifted to private hospitals at Vadodara after their condition worsened. Huge plumes of thick smoke were seen billowing from long distance.Teams of director of industrial safety and health, Gujarat Pollution Control Board, police, and revenue department rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation. P H Patel, deputy director of industrial safety, Bharuch said ""Preliminary reason for the fire is suspected to static electric charge during solvent transfer process in cypermethrin plant. Detailed inquiry will be conducted but the plant has been given closure order with immediate effect.""Falgun Modi, regional officer, GPCB, said ""Due to the blast and fire, volatile organic chemical compounds spread in the atmosphere causing severe air pollution. The contaminated untreated water also spread outside the plant and hence we have advised construction of a bund wall to divert this to the effluent treatment plant so that there is minimum damage to the environment."" Meanwhile, Dahej Police has registered an offence in the incident. The deceased employees were identified as Shreyas Mehta, a trainee engineer and Paraslal Vijay Bahadur, a helper. Those battling for life are Pratik Parmar, Dhaval Bodia, Dashrath Kaul, Sanjay P, RJ Marvania, Marmik Patel, Milan Patel and Ayush Gandhi.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Summer returns, so does fire at Ghazipur landfill","New Delhi: A section of the Ghazipur landfill site was on fire for around 10 hours on Sunday, engulfing the surrounding areas in thick smoke. While the fire has been controlled, a senior EDMC official said such incidents were likely to rise with increasing temperature. ""The landfill site expired its due limit in 2002 but no alternative site has been allocated to us. /Such fires are caused by the production of methane gas from decomposing organic matter in the garbage,"" he explained.Besides being indicators of an acute waste management crisis, Delhi's landfill sites also contribute significantly to its air pollution. Last year, Delhi witnessed a landfill fire on almost every third day, the Delhi Fire Services (DFS) data shows. The fire department had received 131 distress calls with Bhalswa being the biggest contributor to toxic fume followed by Okhla and Ghazipur. Overall, the Bhalswa site had 69 major fire incidents, Okhla 35 and Ghazipur 27.Sunday's fire started around 11am and could only be put out around 9pm. A fire official said the frequency of these fires as well as the challenges in tackling them had been increasing every year due to the rising height of the landfill sites. ""The steep vertical surface makes these sites almost inaccessible. Using water increases the problem as due to the porosity, the dried landfill also becomes active, further decreasing the stability of landfill,"" the official said.Often the vehicles get stuck and freeing them becomes a bigger problem. Delhi now produces around 10,000MT garbage every day which is dumped in its three sites. Bhalswa and Ghazipur landfills have become over 50-60m, or almost-10-storey, high and decomposition of organic garbage produces combustible methane gas, which often catches fire.Toxic fume that these landfills emit include extremely polluting and greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide and monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, dioxins and furans. Allocation of a new site for a waste processing facility in Ghonda Gujran has met with protests from locals. With no new site being allocated, the corporations argue that new waste-to-energy plants are the only way out. ""Every civic body in Delhi is planning to set up additional waste-to-energy plants to consume all garbage generated in our jurisdictions,"" a senior official said.

India & China had 50% of world foul air deaths,"NEW DELHI: Even as India and China together accounted for over 50% of the total 5 million deaths globally from air pollution in 2017, both countries have initiated significant steps to address the problem that now causes more disease burden than smoking, says a new report on global air pollution by two US-based institutes - Health Effects Institute and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Each of the two countries - India and China - registered over 1.2 million deaths in 2017 from air pollution - which includes ambient as well as household air pollution. On an average, the study - titled State of Global Air 2019- reported that the life of a south Asian child born today will be shortened by two years and six months (over two years) growing up in prevailing high levels of air pollution. /In India, air pollution is the third highest cause of death among all health risks, ranking just above smoking. Worldwide, air pollution is responsible for more deaths than other risk factors such as malnutrition, alcohol use, and physical inactivity. While around 82% of the disease burden attributable to air pollution stems from chronic non-communicable diseases, it also contributes to communicable disease. In 2017, India recorded 6,73,000 deaths and a loss of 21.3 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) due to long term exposure to ambient air pollution less than the minimal level, whereas 8,52,000 Chinese died of it the same year and had 19.8 million DALYs. Together, the two countries accounted for 52% of the nearly 3 million global deaths and 50% of the DALYs from exposure to ambient air pollution. The report states that while China has made initial progress with slight decline in pollution levels, India has initiated major steps to address pollution sources. It listed the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana Household LPG programme, accelerated Bharat Stage 6/VI clean vehicle standards, and the new National Clean Air Programme as some of the steps initiated by the government to reduce both outdoor and household air pollution.

"Not just lung diseases, air pollution leads to diabetes deaths too: Report","Bengaluru: Air pollution causes not only breathing ailments but also diabetes deaths, according to the recently released State of Global Air 2019 report, put together by US-based researchers. As per the report, exposure to fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) was the third leading risk factor for Type 2 diabetes deaths in 2017, after high blood sugar and excessive body weight.The same year, Type 2 diabetes accounted for over one million deaths and 57 million DALYs (disability adjusted life years). The burden has increased by 175% and 141% respectively since 1990. While the diabetes rate has gone up in all countries, the largest burden is found in China and India, shows the study.Doctors say once fine particulate matter enters the human blood stream, it leads to inflammation in veins and gradually reduces the quality and quantity of insulin production.However, doctors in Bengaluru say it's tough to convince patients about the correlation between air pollution and diabetes. ""Evidence will come only after air quality is improved. This can be better proven when we live amid clean air, with fresh diabetes cases gradually reducing,"" said Dr Mohan Badgandi, consultant endocrinologist, Manipal Hospitals.According to Dr Badgandi, chemical air pollution - especially nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide components - causes certain changes in body metabolism. /""They lead to vascular endothelium damage, causing harm to blood vessels and inflammation. There is a biological link between air pollution, diabetes and diabetes deaths,"" he explained.""Once the toxic chemicals in the air enter the blood barrier, the body treats them as foreign elements, leading to inflammation. This causes insulin resistance and also reduces insulin production. Air pollution and diabetes are interlinked,"" said Dr Rahul Patil, consultant cardiologist, head, project Premature Coronary Artery Disease (PCAD), Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, who is researching the effects of air pollution on human health. Although genetic and environmental factors play a major role in development of diabetes, other endocrine disruptors like PM 2.5 may play a pivotal role in younger individuals being afflicted in recent years, said Dr S Satish Kumar, endocrinologist and chairman of Ameya Healthcare. ""Though the exact mechanism is yet to be found, research suggests inflammatory markers increase in the body leading to immune activation, which in turn increases insulin resistance. Central nervous system inflammation may also play a role,"" he explained.Dr Satish said those exposed to PM 2.5 on a long-term basis were found to have higher blood glucose levels, blood sugar attached to haemoglobin, LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol), common fat like triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol), factors which lead to increased cardiovascular deaths. BOX: Foul air killed 5 million people in 2017As per the report, long-term exposure to outdoor and indoor air pollution contributed to nearly 5 million deaths from stroke, diabetes, heart attack, lung cancer and chronic lung disease in 2017. South Asian countries - Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan - formed the most polluted region in the world, with over 1.5 million air-pollution related deaths.Who conducted study?The State of Global Air 2019 annual report and accompanying interactive website have been put together by the Health Effects Institute in coordination with the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, University of British Columbia and University of Texas-Austin. Times ViewAccording to the World Health Organisation, air pollution - both ambient and indoor - kills millions every year. While its link to pulmonary diseases is well-established, that it can be fatal for diabetics is alarming and a major cause of concern for patients, who are already at a heightened risk of heart and kidney disorders and stroke. Infamous as the world's diabetes capital, India faces the twin challenges of mitigating the disease's burden and combating air pollution. While policy interventions by the government and transition to renewable energy will go a long way in bettering air quality, citizens can do their bit by ditching private vehicles and wearing masks.

Burning Taleigao dump finally inspected by pollution board,"Panaji: The Goa pollution control board on Friday finally conducted an inspection of the garbage dump at Taleigao that has been burning and emitting toxic fumes for weeks together. ""Once we receive the inspection report we will decide on the action to be taken. It looks like we will have to fine the panchayat for the pollution,"" chairman of the board, Ganesh Shetgaonkar, told TOI. /With no action forthcoming from authorities, residents lodged an official complaint with the board over the burning of plastic and other waste at the dump.""The residents have photographic evidence that the fires burning plastic and garbage did in fact originate from different locations within the dump over a period of approximately one month. There is continuous severe air pollution which residents are facing. They are being subjected to health hazards,"" stated the complaint signed by over a dozen residents. On April 2 evening a huge fire broke out at the village's garbage dump, with clouds of toxic black smoke causing severe air pollution, they added. The fire could be seen for kilometers away and it took three fire tenders over three hours to douse the fire. Traffic had to be diverted to the Taleigao-Dona Paula road. Despite shutting their windows and doors, residents have been inhaling the carcinogenic fumes, with some already complaining about feeling the ill effects of the fumes. Last month, following a complaint, the pollution control board had imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on the neighbouring St Cruz panchayat for burning garbage. Resident Arturo D'Souza had complained to the board about the panchayat suddenly stopping garbage collection in the villagers without giving any reason and that they set the garbage dumps on fire late at night, causing air pollution. This is the second instance of the St Cruz panchayat being fined for burning waste. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Unhealthy diet bigger killer than tobacco',"NEW DELHI: Unhealthy diet is responsible for more premature deaths than tobacco, high blood pressure or any other health risk, a new study published in Lancet has indicated. Dietary risks were the second biggest factor behind deaths and disabilities in 2017 in India, following on the heels of malnutrition.Dietary risk in India has also increased by 35% in a decade since 2007 when it ranked fourth after malnutrition, air pollution and the risk of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).Though malnutrition continues to top the list of risk factors driving most deaths and disabilities in India, its overall impact has declined by 35.3%.While sugar and transfats are harmful, the study highlights the impact of the low consumption of healthy diet constituting of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts and legumes.In India, low intake of whole grains was the leading dietary risk factor for deaths and disability, findings of the study show. Heart attacks and strokes are the main diet-related causes of death, followed by cancers and type 2 diabetes, say researchers.""Although sodium, sugar, and fat have been the main focus of diet policy debate in the past two decades, our assessment shows that the leading dietary risk factors for mortality are diets high in sodium, low in whole grains, low in fruit, low in nuts and seeds, low in vegetables, and low in omega-3fatty acids; each accounting for more than 2% of global deaths,"" the study said suggesting a global shift in policy to promote healthy diet while reducing unhealthy foods such as sweetened beverages and junk food high on salt and trans-fat.The research is part of the Global Burden of Disease study by Seattle-based Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).However, the findings have also raised concerns among nutrition experts in India, who feel the study is shifting the focus of debate from unhealthy food.""While I don't disagree that people should eat more of whole grains and vegetables etc, the research is not dealing with marketing of unhealthy foods which leads to displacement of healthy foods,"" renowned nutrition advocate Arun Gupta says.Globally, poor diet was responsible for 10.9 million deaths, or 22% of all deaths among adults. /Additionally, 255 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) - which equal the sum of life years lost and years lived with disability - were because of poor diet. Cardiovascular disease was the leading cause, followed by cancers and diabetes. Nearly half - 45% - were in people younger than 70.The study found that eating and drinking better could prevent one in five deaths around the world. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

'Kolkata air too toxic for kids',"Kolkata: There has been an alarming rise in asthma and chronic bronchial complications in newborns in Kolkata with no history of these issues in their parents. These can only be attributed to the city's sharply declining air quality. Worse, mothers inhaling toxic air are impacting the children in their wombs, said critical paediatric consultant Dr Kaustabh Chaudhuri.He was speaking at a panel discussion organized by environment group Kolkata Clean Air on the eve of World Health day.Dr Chaudhuri said that children often came to hospitals in a fast-deteriorating condition with serious breathing distress. /Pollution affects their tiny lungs so much that survival becomes difficult. The heart-wrenching scenes at neo-natal ICUs across the city's hospitals from November to March show how uninhabitable we have turned our cities for the children.Senior Pulmonologist Dr Arup Haldar said the recent state of global airhas found that every child in Kolkata is now born with a 36-month reduced life expectancy, compared to those in western nation. ""Kolkata's average life expectancy is 70 years. The report has also found direct link of diabetes with PM2.5 pollution. So, there is no room for doubt why Kolkata is emerging as the diabetes capital of the country,"" he said.Dr Suman Mallik, radiation oncology expert, said, ""Air pollution does not have political boundaries. It is the fifth most common cause of mortality. Kolkata has become one of the most polluted cities of the world. We have to fight both at micro and macro levels. While one-third of the city's population is addicted to tobacco smoking, 65% is affected by passive smoking. Of late, I have been seeing a large number of lung cancer patients who never smoked.

Stubble trouble: Farmers told not to set paddy fields on fire,"Alappuzha: Agriculture department has issued a directive to farmers in Kuttanad asking them not to set paddy fields on fire after harvest.Principle agriculture officer Sheela Panicker said she has asked all Krishi Bhavan officers in Kuttanad to take steps to prevent farmers from setting stubble on fire. ""We have noticed that farmers and padashekhara samitis have been burning fields to destroy stubble. People residing near paddy fields are now facing health issues as thick plume of black smoke emanate from the fields. /Burning of fields is also causing a rise in mercury levels and air pollution,"" she said.The 'puncha' harvesting has almost reached its last leg. Farmers have undertaken paddy cultivation in more than 30,500 hectares in KuttanadNow, the farmers are burning fields claiming that it will destroy stubble, prevent the germination of weedy rice and spread of diseases. The farmers also claim that the fertility of soil will improve if fields are set on fire. Meanwhile, Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad (KSSP) has come out against the farmers and padashekhara samitis. According to Jayan Champakulam, district convener, KSSP environment subject committee, ""The smoke from stubble contains carbon monoxide and other toxic chemicals. Residents are complaining that children were facing health issues due to the smoke. However, the farmers are yet to be aware of the dangers. In 2017, a farmer died after inhaling the smoke while burning his field in Kuttanad.''Mankombu Rice Research Station head Vandana Venugopal said, ""We suggest burning of paddy fields only when the presence of weedy rice and various diseases are rampant in paddy fields. However, during this puncha cultivation, the presence of weedy rice and disease were comparatively low. So, there was no need to burn the paddy fields. But the farmers are continuing with the burning. It will reduce the fertility and nutrients of the soil.""We told farmers to let the stubble decay, in order to retain carbon, nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus in the soil, added Vandana. However, pollution control board district environment engineer Biju Balakrishnan said that the burning of paddy fields in Kuttanad was not creating any pollution. ""Kuttanad is a place with high wind velocity and is very close to sea. So, the wind is disposing of the smoke that is being generated from the paddy fields during burning. So we did not notice air pollution in Kuttanad due to the burning of paddy fields,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Elected caretakers not proactive in finding lasting solution to bad air',"NEW DELHI: For a city with seven MPs and an elected government with several MLAs, the government institutional machinery can at best be described as reactive than pro-active based on evidence available, claims a report titled 'Political Leaders' Positions and Actions on Air Quality'./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/""Instead of instant relief, the city is witnessing criminal negligence and laziness from elected caretakers and their implementation agencies in the form of piece-meal, limited, and short-term impact solutions being applied,"" says the report by a Delhi-based organisation, Climate Trends. It does a review of the political leadership, citizen perceptions and stakeholder initiatives in the 14 cities of India ranked by WHO in 2018 as the world's most polluted. These include three cities of NCR - Delhi, Gurgaon and Faridabad with the capital getting the sixth spot.For Faridabad, ranked second after Kanpur, the warning bells had been ringing since long as all types of pollution sources exist in this industrial town that lead to high levels of pollution in both summer and winter months, contrary to the state government view, the report says. Ranked 11 is Gurgaon. Despite poor air quality it does not yet feature in National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) of Government of India and monitoring of air pollution in the past few years has not been carried out by CPCB. Only in 2018, continuous monitoring started.""Though high levels of toxic metals are being found in children in the city, the sole focus in government policy and MP actions has been on road infrastructure and Metro project,"" it states.Director of Climate Trends Aarti Khosla said that India clearly needs more intense public awareness campaigns. ""The recent State of Global Air report attributed 1.2 million deaths in India due to air pollution. In such a scenario, air pollution alerts and health advisories are a must to contain the public health emergency. While plans are underway, we need greater political commitment for better implementation of existing policies and plans. A national strategy that addresses key sources of pollution - industries, thermal plants, transport, waste management, will have to be developed such that our development doesn't face any compromise but we don't end up compromising public health at the same time,"" she added.According to her, it's a step in the right direction that party manifestos are prioritising air pollution. ""While the Congress manifesto talked about sectoral targets to tackle air pollution, BJP's manifesto talks about converting NCAP into a mission. Our analysis of the 14 most polluted cities of the world, all of which are in north India, clearly shows that there is patchy recognition of the problem of unhealthy air. Inadequate monitoring and insufficient data on poor air quality is a primary reason for limited understanding of the problem,"" she said.The report also points out what Delhi MPs have done on air pollution in Parliament. In 2018, MP from Chandni Chowk and Union minister of environment, forest and climate change, Dr Harsh Vardhan, said that there is no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation of death/disease exclusively to air pollution. New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi has asked questions about air pollution at different times on oddeven, level of pollution, impact of pollution on monuments, pollution measuring devices and monitoring of industries from the relevant ministries.

Track the pollution level in your city,5 foods that help you fend off Parkinson's disease,"On World Parkinson's Day today, ensure a healthy diet that will help keep the disease at bay. Here are five foods to add to your diet to make it fulfilling and wholesome, and elevate your general wellbeing to boost your immunity. /ArtichokeArtichokes are rich in antioxidants which help clear out free radicals from the body, such as toxic substances and stress formed from air pollution, smoking, and poor lifestyle habits. This helps delay ageing, which is a trigger for Parkinson's.OkraOkra or the ladies' finger is rich in folic acid, which can significantly reduce the risk of Parkinson's. Studies conducted on lab mice has shown that the effect of folic acid has debilitating effects on degenerative brain diseases in them.CapsicumParkinson's is a disease that effects the neurological responses. Therefore, it is essential to consume foods that help provide neuroprotective effects. A dietary recommendation of capsicum, consumed two to four times a week helps in shielding the body.BerriesAccording to a study, it was found that those who ate berries such as blueberries and strawberries two or more times a week, had 25 per cent less chances of developing Parkinson's. Berries are rich in flavonoids which protect brain cells from damage.WalnutsAccording to studies, walnuts also contain anti-oxidants that help reverse damaging effects upon the brain. A small portion of walnuts included in one's daily diet goes a long way in combating free radicals, while aiding the brain's daily processes such as memory, learning, and motor coordination.

Aerosol loading highest on Fridays,"Bengaluru: A recent study by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) has found that aerosol loading in the city's air is the maximum on Fridays. Aerosols are solid and liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere and include various kinds of air pollutants as well. Scientists at Divecha Centre for Climate Change (DCCC), IISc, have been analysing aerosol loading in urban centres like Bengaluru using ground-based static and mobile sensors along with data accessed from satellite imagery. /""On an average, aerosol loading over India is increasing at about 2% per year. Weekdays experience more aerosol loading than weekends, with the maximum being found on Fridays,"" said Prof SK Satheesh, chairman, DCCC. Another scientist attributed this to increased human activities like vehicular movement, congestion and other emissions that peak at this time of the week. ""During weekends, aerosol loading settles down only to rise again on weekdays. While air pollutants are definitely part of aerosol, we can't attribute them to the entire aerosol loading as even clouds (which are liquid droplets) are considered aerosol,"" he added.The scientist said only a detailed study will reveal the kind of air pollutants and their levels in the atmosphere. 'Serious health risk' Professor J Srinivasan of DCCC said they recently held a dialogue with experts from the medical community where concerns about rising levels of air pollution in cities like Bengaluru were deliberated. ""In India, air pollution is considered a mere nuisance, whereas it poses a serious health risk. Doctors need to help in increasing awareness about pollution,"" he said.Dr H Paramesh, paediatric pulmonologist from Lakeside Centre for Health Promotion, Bengaluru, said when certain pollutants are inhaled, they not only cause respiratory diseases, but can also affect the lung tissue and enter the blood stream.""These pollutants contribute to a host of non-pulmonary diseases like blood coagulation, stroke, heart attack, BP, diabetes, cancer, autism, dementia and Alzheimer's,"" said Dr Paramesh, a visiting professor at DCCC. Times ViewStudies indicate that urban areas have become hotspots for production of human-made aerosols, but efforts to save the air remain alarmingly inadequate. With urbanization continuing at a breakneck pace, Bengaluru with its unrelenting traffic, poor infrastructure and frothing lakes, is already breathing toxic air. Road dust is another threat. Tiny aerosol particles have a huge impact on climate and human health. It's high time the authorities adopted strict regulations to monitor air pollutants. More studies for better understanding of air quality and effective pollution management are a must.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Indoor air can be 'worse than New Delhi': Study,"Whenever someone refers to air pollution, what comes to your mind? Maybe factories emitting smoke or roads filled with vehicles spewing black smoke, right? Well, that is what an ideal picture of a polluted city looks like. /You clearly don't imagine your house in that picture, right? But you will be stunned to know that indoor air pollution on certain days is worse than the bad days of New Delhi. The study When talking about air pollution, we always refer to the level of toxic substances present in the air outdoor and never really worry about the indoor air quality. We all assume that indoor air quality is good and nothing that one should be worried about. Well, researchers have a different view. As per a recent study conducted at the University of Colorado in Boulder, indoor air pollution, on days when we prepare a lavish meal at home is worse than that of air samples from New Delhi. The study suggests that roasting of meat and vegetables using a gas hob emits fine particles that could make the air of your house dirtier than that of India's national capital, which is the sixth most polluted city in the world.The fine particles released from the gas flames, vegetables, oils and fat send harmful PM 2.5 particulates in the air, which lasts for about an hour in the surrounding. Marina Vance, who led the research at the University of Colorado in Boulder says that even they were surprised to know the level of air pollution indoors. How it is harmfulPM 2.5 air particles are small enough to be easily inhaled by a person. When we inhale these particles, they go deep down in the lungs and can cause respiratory and cardiovascular disease. The fine article can even spread from the lungs to the bloodstream and build up in the liver, heart or worse in the brain and cause mental health-related problems. When we prepare a lavish meal at home, PM 2.5 levels in the house rise to 200 micrograms per cubic meter for one hour. In Delhi, it is 143 micrograms per cubic meter. Inhaling these particles are equally bad as inhaling exhaust from vehicle emissions. A report published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on indoor quality of air also suggests a similar thing. Tips Use extractor hoods while cooking food at home.

Curbing home fuel use can save 2L lives: Study,"New Delhi:  India could make a major dent in air pollution and save over 2 lakh lives a year by curbing emissions from dirty household fuels such as wood, dung, coal and kerosene, a study led by researchers from IIT Delhi revealed.Eliminating emissions from these sources, would bring the average outdoor air pollution levels below the country's air quality standard, the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said.Mitigating the use of household fuels could also reduce air pollution-related deaths in the country by about 13%, which is equivalent to saving about 2,70,000 lives a year, said researchers, including Sagnik Dey of IIT-D. ""Household fuels are the single biggest source of outdoor air pollution in the country,"" said Kirk R Smith, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley in the US.""We looked at what would happen if the country only cleaned up households, and we came to this counterintuitive result that the whole country would reach national air pollution standards if it did that,"" Smith said.As of early 2016, nearly half of the Indian population was reliant on biomass for household fuel, researchers said. In addition to generating greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, these dirty fuels release chemicals and other fine particulate matter that can stick in the lungs and trigger a whole host of diseases.""There are 3,000 chemicals that have been identified in wood smoke, and taken at a macro level, it is very similar to tobacco smoke,"" Smith said.In 2015, India's average annual air pollution level was 55 microgrammes per cubic metre of fine particulate matter, researchers said. /Levels in Delhi, by many estimates, the most polluted city in the world, often soared beyond 300 microgrammes per cubic metre, they said. Complete mitigation of biomass as fuel, which could be achieved through widespread electrification and distribution of clean-burning propane to rural areas, would cut India's average annual air pollution to 38 micrograms per cubic meter, just below the country's National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 40 micrograms per cubic meter.

Fodder for thought,"Stubble becomes a burning issue when paddy is harvested in Punjab and Haryana in autumn. After paddy harvest, the window for sowing wheat is narrow, leading to a spurt in stubble burning as farmers have next to no time to prepare their fields for the next crop.In early April, Rabi crops like wheat are harvested, but farmers have ample time to sow paddy in the kharif cycle as transplantation is not allowed before June 20. Consequently, stubble burning is not as rampant.Wheat generates 17 million tonne of straw and over half of it, or nearly 9 million tonne is turned into fodder, which is sold for nearly Rs 500 per quintal at present. Wheat harvest in one acre field produces over 10 quintals of fodder. Paddy straw has high silica content and is not used to feed animals.With the start of wheat harvesting in Punjab, ground is expected to be prepared for burning crop residue after a few days. The harvest is normally completed across the state within a month, by middle of May. /Only about one-third of wheat straw is burnt as compared with paddy straw yet skyline is expected to be polluted when harvesting is done with. Nearly half of the total wheat straw turned into bhusa or chaff, which is used as fodder for animals.""The only extra cost I spent on managing paddy stubble was pulling it to the sides of my fields with the help of a tractor and keeping it under the trees. Dew drops from leaves of the trees would fall on the heaps of the stubble and helped to decompose it on its own. Now after around six months, most of it is ready to be ploughed back into the fields as manure,"" says Mukesh Chander of Rani Bhatti village near Jalandhar-Pathankot National Highway.Amarjeet Singh and his brother Karamjeet Singh, who are from Chaahdke village, near Bhogpur town, have never burnt stubble since 2006. Part of the stubble they turn into chaff and the rest would be ploughed into the fields.""Our experience has shown that by ploughing biomass into the fields, organic matter increases and strength of soil increases. It reduces water consumption and increases produce without using any chemicals,"" adds Amarjeet.Phagwara-based farmer Avtar Singh, who has been promoting diversification and has never cultivated paddy has a similar story to tell. ""Major part of my stubble is made into chaff and the remaining is left in the fields to decompose.""Punjab is hopeful that its campaign to wean farmers from stubble burning during the wheat harvesting season will be successful. ""We have already launched our campaign against stubble burning in every district but since the state is witnessing delayed harvest, we will go full throttle in May,"" Punjab agriculture department secretary Kahan Singh Pannu tells TOI.Punjab also takes stringent measures like imposing fines and making red entries in land records to dissuade farmers from burning stubble. However, compliance of farmers will depend on the financial viability of the alternative measures.""The response during the previous paddy season was very encouraging. Farmers realised that if they do not set their fields on fire, it ensured high soil value with high organic matter for the next crop. We will focus on spreading awareness. We will also keep a check on farm fires through the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana,"" adds Pannu.Harvesting of wheat has been delayed by 10 days, as the crop is taking more time to fully mature. The cold temperature even after winter has delayed the ripening and rain and hailstorm close to harvest also did not help. Normally, harvesting starts before mid-April.""The weather is expected to normalise in a couple of days and then harvesting will pick pace,"" says Shingara Singh, secretary of BKU Ekta Ugrahan.Delayed wheat harvesting has put pressure on farmers in Punjab's cotton belt of Malwa. Cotton is sowed immediately after wheat and most opt for burning stubble so that they can complete cotton sowing by May-end. ""Farmers going in for cotton after the harvest of wheat burn stubble. The cotton growers have to get the field cleared. As the gap is less between wheat harvesting and cotton sowing, some opt for burning. The farmers also try to get as much fodder from wheat straw as possible and use it for commercial purposes,"" says Amrik Singh, a farmer in Mansa.""Straw generated in very small area under wheat is put on fire and this has relatively weaker environmental impact compared to paddy straw. As per rough estimates, straw generated in 4-5 lakh hectares is put on fire,"" Pannu said.'Happy' solution that most farmers seek?Cutting down on stubble burning and using Happy Seeders to sow wheat has actually helped farmers reap rich benefits - in terms of savings over the use of fertilisers and pesticides and also improve the quality of the crop.Farmers across Punjab using Happy Seeders to sow wheat have seen a drastic reduction in the need to fertilise fields and in use of pesticides or weedicides. The use of machinery has also cut down the need to set stubble on fire.Jagsir Singh Gill, a progressive farmer from Khosa village near Moga, who used Happy Seeder to sow wheat on 40 acres of his land, says he is extremely happy with the results. ""For last two crops, I have used Happy Seeder without setting stubble on fire and it has have given me excellent results. Earlier, I used to put five quintals of urea along with pesticides worth over Rs 700 to increase the yield. However, after I stopped setting crop residue on fire and used the Happy Seeder instead, the fertiliser requirement has reduced. This year, I have sown 3,086 variety of wheat and have used 110 kg of urea and no pesticide or weedicide,"" he said.The cost of using Happy Seeder was not more than five litres of diesel per acre, which has minimal effect on the input cost. ""When we compared the savings on pesticide and fertilisers, even this amount gets compensated,"" Gill added.Satnam Singh Ajnala, from Rajjian village in Ajnala block of Amritsar district, says he has not set his stubble on fire since 2011. ""Earlier, I used rotavators for three years and then MB plough to deal with the stubble. But this time, I used Happy Seeder and the results are overwhelming.""The United Nations Environment Programme has provided three Happy Seeders, a chopper and an MB plough to Rajjian Bhoewali and Kiampur villages to deal with stubble.Ajnala said 90% of the residents of these three villages had adopted alternative means to deal with stubble. Economics, he says, is manageable. Subsidised cost of Happy Seeder is Rs 75,000 and it uses around 3 litres of diesel to sow wheat on an acre. Not setting stubble on fire and using it to enhance soil fertility not only brings down input cost for fertilisers, pesticides and weedicides but also increases crop quality. ""Many farmers did not use even a single drop of pesticide or weedicide on the crop, making it organic,"" he said.'Don't make us invest in machines'However, farmers object to being made to invest in heavy machineries, which they claim ultimately beats the purpose as diesel is not environment friendly. For instance, Chander, who is also the sarpanch of his village, says he did not use heavy machines-based techniques promoted by Punjab government. ""They are promoting machines which then require big tractors. Those methods are not only pushing farmers to make heavy investments on machinery but they also increase recurring cost and are not environment friendly as one requires to burn a lot of diesel,"" says Chander. He also says that after the Punjab government announced subsidy on such machines their prices were pushed up.""Instead of looking for solutions to the paddy stubble problem and urging farmers to make heavy investments on machinery, the government should find a replacement to paddy, as its cultivation has pushed Punjab to the brink of ecological disaster,"" he adds.Jaswinder Singh at Kheri Mallan village in Patiala district, whose wheat crop on 15 acres got infested by pests blamed Happy Seeder for destroying his entire crop. However, agriculture expert Dr Jasvinder Singh of Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Patiala, has an explanation - pests in Jaswinder's wheat crop are generally found in paddy and got transferred to the wheat crop. He claimed it was the only case in which crop sown using Happy Seeder got infested with the pest.Cash 'em: How stubble can earn moolahMany farmers in Khanna, Ludhiana district, and Amloh in Fatehgarh Sahib district collect stubble from hundreds of farmers in their area and pay them for it. These farmers, in turn, earn money by selling collected stubble to industrial units that use it for power generation.""For last six-seven years, we haven't burnt stubble in my 30-acre land after we realised we could sell it to an industrial unit for power generation. Not only that, we also buy stubble from hundreds of farmers and sell it to the unit. By doing so, we prevent air pollution,"" says 40-year-old Jasvir Singh, from Turmuri village near Khanna.""It is not easy for farmers to dispose of the stubble, as they need to spend Rs 2,000-3,000 per acre. They can earn some money from selling stubble but it needs a lot of effort.""His brother Maggar Singh said their fields generate around 700 quintals of stubble and last year they collected 18,000 tonnes of stubble and sold it to an edible oil factory on Amloh Road. ""By collecting 18,000 tonnes, we ensured that farmers don't set stubble on fire in as many as 3,000 acres of land.""Health issues also act as a deterrent, say other villagers. ""I stopped burning stubble about five years ago after my younger brother, Dharminder Singh developed respiratory problem. We realised that apart from causing air pollution, burning of stubble also results in damage to microbes beneficial to soil. Besides there are chances of accidents for road users as smoke decreases visibility on roads,"" says Shiv Raj Singh, a farmer of Majri Kishnewal village in Amloh.Many farmers are joining the no-stubble burning league as they come to know about its use in power generation. ""We haven't burnt stubble in four acres of our land since last year. Some farmers collect it from our fields and we don't have to spend on transportation and also will not be punished for burning it,"" said Dilbar Singh.Last year, during the paddy harvest season, absence of low cost methods for straw management and government's strict action against stubble burning had led some farmers to abandon straw rolls in Raikot on roadsides along the Ludhiana road. They are still lying along the road.(With inputs from Neel Kamal in Bathinda, IP Singh in Jalandhar, Manish Sirhindi in Patiala, and Shariq Majeed in Ludhiana) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Anti-pollution mask market to reach $16.86 million by 2023: ASSOCHAM- TechSci study,"MANGALURU: India's anti-pollution mask market may generate revenue of $16.86 million by end of 2023 from $6.16 million in 2017 due to deteriorating air quality, rapid urbanisation, increasing purchasing power and expanding urban population, according to a joint study by ASSOCHAM-TechSci Research.The pollution mask market grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.45%, in value terms during 2013-17, noted ASSOCHAM-TechSci Research on 'bio medical waste & air pollution'. The presence of high concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 in the air leads to high pollution levels in northern parts of India, especially Delhi NCR, which is among the most polluted regions in the country. As a result, demand for anti-pollution masks from northern India is increasing, noted the ASSOCHAM study.The pollution mask market is projected to grow at a CAGR of more than 18% by 2023, on the back of growing health concerns due to deteriorating air quality in the country, especially across the urban areas. Increasing CO2 emissions due to surging industrial activity and expanding vehicle fleet, rising sales of pollution masks through online channels and intensifying competition are some of the other factors expected to boost pollution mask market in the country over the course of next five years.Moreover, increasing per capita expenditure on healthcare and safety products and rising consumer awareness regarding respiratory diseases and benefits of anti-pollution products are anticipated to fuel demand for pollution masks in India in the coming years.Masks are filters that prevent fine particles from entering the nasal passage and the lungs. /The finer the particles that a mask filters, the more dense texture of the mask is.Long-term effects of being exposed to fine particulate air pollution can cause heart disease, lung disease, and lung cancer. It can also cause damage to the brain, kidney, liver and nerves.Air pollution has become one of the biggest challenges for both developed and developing economies. It is also threatening the existence of the human race due to effects like global warming and acid rain.Developing countries like India and China in Asia and the African continent will continue to contribute to a growing load of carbon emissions across the world. Thus, it becomes evident that both developed and developing economies need to come together on a common platform and join hands to fight this menace. Moreover, exchange of clean technologies from the developed world needs to be increased. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Four triggers of Asthma that you should know,"As air pollution levels inevitably increase with each passing day, ailments related to lungs and breathing are also at an all-time high. Asthma is one of the leading cases among air-pollution related sicknesses. /Living in cities only makes it worse. Here are four ways to mitigate the possibility of Asthma.DustOne of the most common causes, dust instantly triggers an asthma attack. As a result, those suffering from it should take precautions by wearing an anti-dust mask while stepping outdoors. And it is not just outdoors, even indoors, maintain maximum cleanliness to keep away dust. Install air-purifiers for the same. Tobacco and smokeSmoke also instigates breathing problems, so asthma patients should stay away from areas where there is smoke, such as outdoors, and kitchens; as well as those who smoke cigarettes. Smoking, thus, is a complete no-no for those who have asthma. PetsThose suffering from asthma are recommended to not have pets such as dogs and cats as their fur is a leading cause of irritation for them. Falling fur, as well as dust mites trapped in the pets' fur can exacerbate sneezing and breathing troubles.  MouldMoisture and mould are another trigger for asthma as they trap dust and humidity. Invest in a dehumidifier for your home to maintain optimum humidity levels, which is not higher than 50 per cent. Be especially careful in rainy season. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Asthma can be partly cured if managed effectively: Experts,"CHANDIGARH: Taking nebulizer for asthma without consulting a doctor can be harmful for your kids as it might lead to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)- a fungus which can cause irreversible changes in the lungs.This is the recent findings of a study at the PGI and the report has been submitted to the department of health research, ICMR.Prof Meenu Singh, the main author and head of the pulmonary medicine unit at the PGI's advanced paediatric centre, cautions: ""The project has just completed and it has been submitted to the ICMR. We found that those who were positive with the ABPA were mostly coming from damp homes. The study found that 18% poorly controlled asthmatic patients had this fungus,"" she said.Does this fungal infection worsen the condition of those suffering from asthma?""/The ABPA is being seen in adults since last 4-5 years and now we found it in children too who were not getting relieve despite proper treatment. These patients have the risk of developing lung changes which ultimately leads to progressive lung damage. This is not seen in asthma per se,"" said Prof Meenu.Prof Meenu and her team are making Indian guidelines for the treatment of the ABPA for asthmatic patients. But what can this infection be attributed to?""Besides damp homes, those who nebulize often were not found to be cleaning it after use. The device gets fungus colonies. Also, those on steroids for uncontrolled asthma, had this fungus as steroids provide medium for the growth of this pathogen,"" said Prof Meenu.The PGI daily sees 20 cases of asthma at its OPD and special clinic. But, with seasonal variations, pollination, wheat season and harvesting, there is a spike in this respiratory disease.""During October and November and the present months, there is four times increase in the symptoms. We recommend patients to change the dosage accordingly much before the change in the season,"" said Prof Meenu.The reasons for prevalence of asthma can be attributed to air pollution, smoking, incorrect treatment in children, seasonal variations causing viral infections such as common flu and ignorance among parents.""Asthma can be partly cured if managed effectively. It's a myth that those who use inhalers get addicted,"" said Prof SK Jindal, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine, PGI. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
World Asthma Day 2019: Do you suffer from exercise-induced asthma?,"You may or may not have asthma but there are certain exercises that make you gasp for breath, experience deep wheezing and coughing - pretty much similar to an asthma attack. It is called bronchoconstriction, which occurs due to vigorous or prolonged physical exertion. Although people with chronic asthma experience symptoms of exercise-induced asthma during workouts, there are many people without chronic asthma who also develop similar symptoms, only during exercise. Ideally, the symptoms of exercise induced asthma begins within 5 to 20 minutes of the workout. /The symptoms that tell you are suffering from it are: Tightening of the chest or painCoughing with asthmaWheezingUnusual fatigue Shortness of breath Poorer athletic performance Dr. Abhay Uppe, Pulmonologist from Terna Speciality Hospital & Research Centre, shares, "" Many people these days are reporting symptoms of exercise induced asthma, especially the younger lot who likes to participate in marathons or walkathon. Sometimes such symptoms are temporary and may happen due to cold or polluted air in the environment you are working out or due to a previous infection or disease in your body. A number of conditions can cause similar symptoms, making it important to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis and start medication.""But why does it happen? Dr Anand Jaiswal, Director, Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Medanta, Gurgaon. explains, ""The air we breathe in normally is first warmed and moistened by the nasal passages. However, during exercise, we tend to breathe through our mouth thereby inhaling colder and drier air. The muscle bands around the nasal airways are sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity and react by contracting, which narrows the airways. This results in exercise induced asthma.""Dr. Manoj Goel, Director, Pulmonology at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram adds, ""A person with asthma has a 90 per cent chance of having bronchoconstriction. However, there are certain triggers that can worsen the condition such as air pollution, cold air, chlorine in swimming pool or dry air.""Does that mean you should stop working out? Experts suggest that people suffering from exercise-induced exercise should not stop exercising and can instead treat the symptoms. How is it tested? One of the more common tests for exercise induced asthma is a Spirometer, which is an apparatus that can help you measure the volume of air inhaled and exhaled by the lungs. The condition can also be diagnosed with a normal lung function test or with exercise challenge test. As part of the test, it will be observed how your breathing rate fluctuates when you using a treadmill or use any other stationary exercise equipment. In order to eliminate the risk of other diseases like vocal cord dysfunction, lung diseases or allergies, you may have to take additional tests. Here are some preventive measures:First step is to seek emergency medical treatment in case of shortness of breath or wheezing that is rapidly increasing leading to difficulty in breathing Asthma medications can prevent the airways from contracting. The preferred asthma medication is salbutamol as puff or dry powder inhalerMonitor your existing ailments and take your medications timely. If one has allergies and asthma, workout should be limited during high pollen days, or when air pollution levels are high or during winter months Never underestimate the importance of warm-up.In changing weather, especially when it gets cold or dry, wear a scarf while exercising. Avoid triggers of your asthma and other ailments.Avoid going in heavy traffic before and after exercising. Never skip workouts. They will help promote good respiratory health.  For people suffering from acute distress, the best exercise is swimming, since it is performed in a warm, moist air environment  All in all, it is extremely important to handle exercise induced asthma carefully as it can be life-threatening. Before going to see a doctor, you must do some self evaluation to see how long the symptoms last and whether you have asthma or any allergies. This condition, in no way, should stop you from exercising. So do not overlook symptoms and consult a pulmonologist for better diagnosis and management.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
91% premature deaths due to air pollution in low and middle-income countries: UNEP,"NEW DELHI: In the run up to the World Environment Day with its theme of ""air pollution"", the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on Thursday urged governments across the globe to deal with this silent killer by adopting 4Rs - reduce, recycle, reuse, recover - in their respective national policies and flagged how dirty air hurts the poorest most as 91% of premature deaths occurred in low and middle-income countries.Its latest report on measuring progress on environmental aspects of the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) shows that the mortality rate attributed to air pollution was highest in 'Sub-Sahara Africa' and 'Central & Southern Asia' with 187 and 170 deaths per lakh of population, respectively.India figures in the 'Central & Souther Asia' SDGs' regional grouping along with 13 other countries of this region including its South Asian neighbours and Iran.

Disease burden of air pollution is expected to be high in India because of high incidence of poverty, high exposure of the majority to pollution sources, use of highly polluting fuels and technologies especially solid fuels for cooking, and very weak pollution control in small scale industrial units,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, head of air pollution and clean transportation programme at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).Noting how the exposure to polluted air combined with malnutrition and poor health status of the population, in fact, increase public health risk manifold, she said, ""Even the rich cannot be safe if poor people cannot breathe clean air.""The 'Sub-Sahara Africa' regional grouping consists of all the poor countries of this continent along with developing nations such as South Africa and Kenya.The report notes that the relatively richer regions, on the other hand, reported comparatively lesser number of deaths. /The figures show that 'Australia and New Zealand' together reported only 8 deaths per one lakh of population while the Europe reported 13 deaths, North America reported 89 deaths and 'East and South-East Asia' which includes China reported 106 deaths per one lakh of population.The UNEP in its report analysed the World Health Organisation's (WHO) data which had put the total estimated number of deaths globally due to indoor and outdoor (ambient) air pollution at 7 million in 2016.Recently the 'State of Global Air 2019', released by the Health Effects Institute (an independent global health and air pollution research institute) showed that the exposure to outdoor and indoor air pollution contributed to over 1.2 million deaths in India in 2017.Though India had never denied serious health implications of air pollution, it preferred not to endorse international studies including those from the WHO. The government here on several occasions told the Parliament that these estimates were merely based on ""models, simulations and extrapolations"".""Though air pollution is one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and associated diseases, there are no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation of death/disease exclusively due to air pollution,"" the government told the Parliament even in last winter session, held during the period when Delhi and most of the cities in the Indo-Gangetic plain suffered due to severe air pollution condition.

Air pollution: Health dept to hold camps to check respiratory disease,"Bareilly: With the rise in air pollution level a major cause of concern for city's residents, health officials following the state government's directives have issued advisory on health risks and ways to prevent it.All community health centres and primary health centres in the district will hold camps to check respiratory ailments among residents. Chief medical officer (CMO) has also nominated a nodal officer for health consequences related to air pollution.According to officials, a person can be affected with air pollution considering the level of pollution and duration of exposure. Among the harmful pollutants present in the air are particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, black carbon, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.""Short-term to long-term exposure to air pollutants can lead to several problems, including irritation to eyes, nose and throat, cough, wheezing, chest discomfort and acute upper respiratory infections. /While long-term exposures to even lower level of pollution can cause chronic illnesses of respiratory and cardiovascular system and lung cancer. Children aged below five years of age, pregnant women, pre-disposed health conditions and people working outdoors in polluted setting like traffic policemen, construction workers, sweepers and roadside vendors, are categorised as vulnerable to health consequences of air pollution,"" said Dr Meesam Abbas, district epidemiologist.Dr Vineet Shukla, CMO, said, ""From this month, we will hold health camps in different parts of the district to check if locals are suffering from respiratory or other illness related to air pollution and ensure proper treatment of patients. We will start awareness drive across Bareilly to educate residents about impact of air pollution on health and precautionary measures.""Shukla added, ""On the direction of state government, district hospital has been selected as sentinel hospital. We will now have to send a monthly report to higher authorities on the number of respiratory illness cases reported - cases of respiratory illnesses requiring nebulization, cases of respiratory illnesses requiring admission, cases of respiratory illnesses requiring invasive and non-invasive ventilation.""According to officials, the residents should keep washing their eyes with running water and do regular gargling with warm water. They should also consult a doctor in case of breathlessness, giddiness, cough, chest discomfort or pain or irritation in eyes (red or watery). For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Bengaluru hospital sees 20% rise a year in eye disease,"Bengaluru: A child rubbing her eyes must not be ignored as it could be a symptom of a serious eye infection given high air pollution levels, warn ophthalmologists.""Dryness and inflammation are a vicious combination which leads to allergies. When children continuously rub their eyes due to allergies, it could lead to keratoconus,"" said Dr Raghu Nagaraju, senior consultant, cornea and refractive surgery, Dr Agarwal's Eye Hospital, on Wednesday. /In 2017-18, the hospital had 400 patients with keratoconus and in 2018-19, there were 480 cases, a 20% increase in a year. Keratoconus, a progressive disease in which the cornea becomes thin and bulges into a conelike shape, eventually affects vision.Dr Ravi, medical director and cenior consultant of the hospital, said one in every 1,500 children in India suffers from the disease and children between 10 and 15 years are especially susceptible. ""This condition is also suspected in cases where blurred vision doesn't improve even after wearing spectacles. Parents should limit children's exposure to smart screens and avoid artificial light,"" said Dr Preeti DK, consultant ophthalmologist.Keratoconus is a progressive disease and the number of cases has risen by 10% in India over the past five years.Yuvaraj HS, a 32-year-old sugarcane juice vendor, suffered from keratoconus. It was a case of untreated childhood keratoconus coupled with air pollution. While non-surgical intervention didn't help, he underwent a corneal transplant recently and his vision was restored.- Pearl D'Souza For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Why dust storms are a growing threat," Compared to other, better investigated weather phenomena, dust storms struggle to receive attention. They should, for many in Delhi-NCR who suffer from respiratory disorders pay a price. Gurgaon and its neighbours face a triple threat - from pre-monsoon dust squalls, toxic autumn smog caused by crop-burning fires, and year-round construction dust. But while we haven't been able to protect ourselves from the vagaries of climate and the side-effects of development, custodians of sacred groves scattered across Haryana can lend us a helping hand. Because, there's much merit in the old ways. /Shilpy Arora reports It's approaching peak summer, and dust hangs in the air. For 15-year-old Shreyas, diagnosed with asthma six years back, summer once offered a respite from air pollution. But that was until a couple of years ago. Now, even the hot weather brings with it increased likelihood of asthma attacks, allergies and similar symptoms. Shreyas's doctor blames rising pollution levels triggered by ever-intense dust storms, blowing in either from the Arabian Peninsula or the Thar desert. And the specialists agree.Delhi-NCR is no stranger to dust storms during May and June. For decades, the region has been witness to these squalls, in which sand particles from the Thar, at their driest before the monsoon, are carried along on strong winds towards the capital and its surrounding areas. But, very rarely did sandstorms lead to a jump in air pollution. Now, for those sensitive to even the slightest worsening in air quality, the heat of India's north brings with it as much misery as the cold.  GRIM DETAILS BEHIND THE REALITY  A recent study attempted to quantify the impact of the dust storms of May 2018, unprecedented in their ferocity, on the quality of air over Delhi. The study revealed that various pollutants, including deadly ozone, rose during last year's extreme event, imperiling the health of residents. ""Dust originating from Sahara and Thar desert areas are known to be rich in nitrates that convert as oxides of nitrogen. Hence, an increase in ozone precursors (carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen) takes place after major dust events in Indo-Gangetic Plain that is likely to enhance surface ozone,"" states the study, titled 'Impact of Deadly Dust Storms (May 2018) on Air Quality, Meteorological, and Atmospheric Parameters Over the Northern Parts of India'. It continues, ""Such processes also increase PM2.5/PM10 and harmful greenhouse gases (ozone and carbon monoxide) at the surface that has an adverse impact on human health."" Using data from space platforms, ground stations and global climate models, the study scrutinised details gathered during three back-to-back dust storms that swept the north a year back. It found that during the storms, Delhi experienced the worst air quality relative to other cities, with both PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations surging notably during the second and third dust storms (behind the research was senior author Ramesh P Singh, professor at Chapman University, California, US; lead author Sudipta Sarkar, chief research scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA; and co-authors Akanksha Chauhan and Rajesh Kumar, Sharda University, Greater Noida). A LETHAL COCKTAIL  Another study, carried out in Delhi-NCR by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) last summer, also discovered an increase in ozone levels during the onset of summer. It found that Gurgaon faced the highest number of days (in Delhi-NCR) on which ozone levels exceeded the eight-hour standard, during April and May 2018.""On 57% of days during this period (in Gurgaon), ozone has recorded levels higher than the standards; during May alone, 71% of the days have recorded exceedance. In Faridabad, 34% of days, and in Noida 26% of days have recorded exceedance,"" the study noted. The CSE research relied on data from 31 automatic monitoring stations of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, Central Pollution Control Board and India Meteorological Department. Worryingly, high levels of ozone are associated with premature death counts, putting the lives of those with respiratory diseases, particularly children and the elderly, at serious risk. Add increased concentration of nitrogen oxide and particulate matter, and you have a toxic summer concoction. Kushagra Rajendra, head of department, Amity School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, says two factors explain why the summer air over Delhi-NCR has become fouler. ""First, as the indigenous sources of pollution are already high in the region, dust-laden winds lead to deterioration in the air quality,"" he told TOI. ""For example, if a glass is already 95% full, even the slightest addition would lead to spillage - same is the case with air pollution in Delhi-NCR. Second, natural barriers, including green spaces and the Aravalis, have been degraded over the years,"" Rajendra added. WAITING IN VAIN FOR RELIEF  So, where before only winters would trigger respiratory ailments and allergies, today there's no guarantee that summer wouldn't bring the same. Because air pollution, says senior pulmonologist Dr Himanshu Garg, has become a year-long eventuality. ""While earlier we were witnessing five to 10 patients a week with respiratory illnesses and allergies during this season, now the number has gone up to 20-25 cases,"" said Dr Garg. Cases of asthma among the elderly, he adds, have seen a spike during this time of year. ""Generally, people manifest asthma episodes by the age of 30. However, manifestations of asthma are now being reported in elderly - environmental factors are clearly responsible for this trend."" There's more evidence that our health is adversely impacted by the pollution that is generated by dust storms, says Dr Arunesh Kumar, senior pulmonologist at Paras Hospital, Gurgaon. ""Though sand particles are not very fine, they can trigger symptoms of asthma and various other allergies and respiratory ailments,"" he pointed out. It's a vicious cycle. ""The problem is that the underlining pollution levels remain high throughout the year in the city,"" holds Dr Garg. ""While stubble burning and low wind speed lead to a rise in concentration of pollutants during winter, dust storms play spoilsport during summer,"" he informed.  ANSWER? THINK BEYOND STOPGAP  Clearly, there is an immediate need to preserve natural barriers to dust storms. More importantly, say the experts, authorities must dump expediency in favour of durable solutions, to bring down local sources of pollution. Ramesh P Singh, senior author of the study, and professor at Chapman University, California, US, says we can't prevent dust storms. ""However, we can deal with the situation by providing an early-warning system and a website where people can visualise or monitor dust. The early-warning system will also help in working on bringing down other sources of air pollution so that dust storms don't lead to a rise in air pollution,"" he adds.""At one time, the thick forests of the Aravalis would give rise to seasonal rivers, which helped moderate wind speed and acted as a barrier in countering strong dust-laden winds,"" explains C R Babu, professor emeritus and head of the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystem (CEMDE) at Delhi University. ""The Aravali range acted as a constraint and checked the spread of the Indian desert towards upper Indo-Gangetic plains - its degradation is a major cause of dust storms. Moreover, vegetation covers within the city have also gone down, making the situation worse,"" he reminds.Alas, the Aravali range is no longer the robust buffer it once was, against extremes of weather. For this state of affairs, unchecked mining, widespread land-use change and rampant exploitation of the terrain is to blame. All the more reason, insists Rajendra, to revive this ecosystem. ""Authorities should work on long-term plans to keep indigenous sources of pollution, including diesel and vehicular pollution, unregulated waste dumping and construction activities, under control throughout the year,"" he advises. It might, however, be too late for those who have prioritised their physical and emotional wellbeing over the prospect of a well-paid job. And unless the authorities show more urgency to tackle what is quickly becoming an emergency situation, many more might consider leaving the dust bowl that is now Gurgaon.

Pollution: What it does to your skin and how to protect skin from it,"Every year, the pollution keeps getting worse, which can take a toll on the skin. The upper layer of our skin, epidermis plays the role of a barrier from the harmful effects of the environment. However, with the overexposure of pollution, the barrier fails to work. /Major air pollutants that have adverse effects on the skin include the solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR), volatile organic compounds (VOC), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), nitrogen oxides (NO), particulate matter (PM), and cigarette smoke.Pollution blocks the skin pores and makes the skin unhealthy. With all this, the skin can get congested, dehydrated and irritated. It can also lead to early skin ageing and inflammatory/allergic skin conditions like atopic dermatitis, urticaria, psoriasis rosacea or acne. Pollution breaks down the collagen and the lipid layer on the skin, which impairs skin barrier's functions. This and dehydration are among the most immediate threats air pollution imposes on our skin. Here are a few anti-pollution measures you can take to protect and restore your skin's health with the growing pollution:Cleansing: A two-step process for cleansing is recommended. You can start by using a cleansing wipe or make-up removal pad and then wash with a cleanser to remove any remaining make-up, dirt or pollution left on the skin. You can also use cleansing brushes, which are better than using just hands. Antioxidants: They can be used in both topical and oral forms. They help neutralize the free radical-induced damage done by pollution. You can also increase the intake of citrus fruits, pomegranate, berries, carrots and green tea, that are loaded with antioxidant power. And, if you are fond of alcohol drinks, it's best to switch to red wine which is loaded with polyphenol based antioxidants.Hydration: Drink a lot of water and choose a skin care routine as per your skin type. For hydrating your skin, you can use a serum or a daily moisturiser consisting of antioxidants. It will help to create layers of protection and won't let small particles penetrate into the skin.UV Protection: The best way to protect your skin is to apply sunscreen. It will protect your skin from UV induced damage and also trap the smog particles and prevent these harmful chemicals from penetrating into the skin.DIY treatments- For cleansing, you can mix yoghurt with a tablespoon of lemon juice and honey. This deep-cleansing routine will help to reverse the damage caused by pollutants.- If your skin is getting too dry, you must apply cocoa butter. It helps to promote skin's elasticity and reduce scarring. To keep your skin healthy, apply it twice a week for skin nourishment. - You can also apply olive oil, which has a high content of Vitamin E and antioxidants promoting cell regeneration and helping reduce the appearance of damages. Apply with circular movements preferably at night. This will help to rejuvenate the dull skin caused due to pollution.Inputs by Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi, MD Director, Consultant Dermatologist & Specialist Hair Transplant Surgeon, MedLinks.

"Declare fire as 'disaster', govt urged","Margao: Chief officer of the Margao Municipal Council (MMC), Siddhivinayak Naik, on Tuesday wrote to the South Goa district collector to the effect that the fire at Sonsoddo be declared as a ""disaster"" under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.The major fire that broke out at the garbage dump yard at Sonsoddo, at the outskirts of Margao, Monday afternoon continues to ceaselessly emit plumes of smoke and, at regular intervals, raging flames. Though the fire is under control and not spreading, officials of the fire and emergency services (F&ES) acknowledged that the air pollution caused by the thick black smog is turning out to be an environmental hazard. ""Since the fire broke out on Monday, five fire tenders from Margao, Curchorem, Ponda, Verna and Vasco, have made altogether 50 trips with 25 fire brigade personnel engaged in the fire fighting operation,"" deputy director, F&ES, Nitin Raikar, told TOI. /Declaring a calamity as a 'disaster' under the Disaster Management Act by the state government, sources said, enables the authorities to release funds under the State Disaster Response Fund to carry out relief and rehabilitation works. ""Besides, services of multiple agencies can be utilised under an Incident Command system - the standardised hierarchical structure designed to aid in the management of resources during calamities - to ensure speedy response to disaster,"" an official source said.The move assumes significance in the wake of the decision of the MMC to order a consignment of Renerzyme, an eco-friendly bio-product, to be used in the fire fighting operations. Confirming this, Naik told TOI, that the Renerzyme treatment was effectively deployed for dousing the fire that broke out at the garbage dump at Deonar, Mumbai, last year. Officials of the company dealing in the product have claimed, Naik said, Renerzyme treatment could ensure that the fire and smog are controlled within a few hours. The technique was even tried at the landfill site at Vadodara in Gujarat and Jambuva in MP, and was found to be effective, sources said.Fire brigade personnel commenced Renerzyme treatment on the burning garbage no sooner the consignment dispatched from Mumbai landed in Goa Tuesday evening. Senior officials of the firm assisted the fire brigade in the operations. Explaining the process, officials of the firm said that the concentrate is added to the water tanker of the fire brigade in a proportion of 1:50 and sprayed on the dump. Once sprayed, the enzyme multiplies and stops the process of methane gas formation. Naik later told TOI that the exercise ""appears to be proving effective"".

Burning of garbage piles creating pollution on way to Badrinath,"Karnaprayag: Pilgrims going to the Badrinath shrine are encountering what are certainly not pleasant sights. Heaps of garbage can be found burning in open dumping grounds at quite a few places on the route to Badrinath, most significantly at Karnaprayag, where dark smoke contaminating the air welcomes the pilgrims.The burning garbage piles are not only causing air pollution, but also polluting the Alaknanda river, a source stream of river Ganga.Commenting on the issue, Anil Joshi, Doon-based environmentalist, told TOI that immediate steps should be taken to curb this air and river pollution. ""Pilgrims must be refrained from taking plastic materials or polythene bags to the temple. /The situation should also be constantly monitored by the authorities,"" he added.Notably, this open dumping of garbage and its burning is happening despite a National Green Tribunal (NGT) order, which imposes a cash fine of Rs 25,000 on people who set garbage on fire. Pilgrims meanwhile say that such blatant pollutiing acts which are severely damaging the pristine natural environment of the Himalayas, are causing them much distress.Narrating the experience of her journey to Badrinath shrine, Anita Sharma, a pilgrim from Bareilly, told TOI, ""After crossing Rudraprayag, we (the pilgrims) came across many spots where garbage piles were burning. The black smoke from the piles had almost covered the sky and the stench was horrible. One does not expect to see such sights in the Himalayas where people go expecting to see natural beauty.""When asked to comment on the issue, Surendra Singh Negi, Karnaprayag MLA, told TOI, ""We are aware of the situation. Due to lack of space, we don't have any dumping zones as yet. We have discussed the issue with the nagar palika parishad and are working to find a technological solution to the entire issue.""

Kolkata: Citizens ride cycles for a better environment,"KOLKATA: A cycle ride organized in Salt Lake during World Environment Week saw participation from over 100 cyclists from different walks of life on Sunday. Students, environmentalists, professionals, sports and health enthusiasts who believe that cycling has a big role to play in reducing the levels of air pollution in the city of Kolkata.This event, organized by Kolkata Clean Air and Switch ON in association with Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, Bike Studio, Cycle Network Grow, Volunteer and Akriti Photography saw the city come together to raise awareness among the citizens about air pollution and inch towards zero-emission mobility.This year the Theme for World Environment Day is Beat Air Pollution to be held on 5th June and 3rd June also happens to be World Bicycling Day. The organisers, fearing that Kolkata was making the same mistake other cities made, demanded to provide equal right to space to all its citizens. European cities that became car-centric realised later that bicycles and public transport needed to be prioritised and turned their backs on car-centric policies.The event was a zero waste affair, with no single-use plastic used or flex banners - all the waste is going to be composted or recycled. /The ride started at Central Park Salt Lake and ended with a loop from Rabindra Teertha, covering approximately a distance of 20 km. All riders were presented a Gulmohar sapling in a reusable cloth bag, encouraging them to plant trees, which has a significant and positive impact on the air quality. Free cycles were made available at the venue for cyclists.Speaking at the event, Dr Suman Mallik, clinical director, chief of radiation oncology, Narayana Superspeciality Hospital said, ""Air pollution has become a leading cause of respiratory diseases and lung cancer. In terms of air pollution, Kolkata has not only touched the country's capital, but has also surpassed it on a few occasions. Kolkata Clean Air has come forward to spread the awareness among all citizens and to work hand in hand to provide a clean and safe environment for us and more precisely for our next generation. I encourage all people to cycle regularly to not only improve their health but also help reduce pollution levels. Let us all do our bit towards saving the environment.""Apratim from Akriti Photography said, "" The involvement of the youth is the need of the hour as the future lies on their shoulders"".Air pollution has become one of the largest killers in the world today. Almost seven million people die prematurely each year due to this silent killer - three times more than AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis combined.Speaking at the event, Ajay Mittal of Kolkata Clean Air said, ""The effects of air pollution are the last warning we are receiving from our planet, much like the final signals our body gives during last stages of cancer. If we ignore them this time, it will cause irreversible damage to life on this planet.""Vinay Jau of Switch ON, one of the event organisers said, ""In the times of polluted air and climate change, Kolkata needs to rediscover the ingenuity of the humble cycle. Making cycling safe and convenient should be a top priority of the government and motorists.""""The humble cycle is a great way to commute - with no pollution or Carbon emissions. Life on planet is at risk due to climate change and we must reverse it. Kolkata should look at developing infrastructure to support cycles with the vision to make Kolkata one of the most liveable and climate-friendly cities in the world,"" he added.

'Breathing in clean air can up life expectancy',"PATNA: A short lifespan, respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases and psychological ill-effects are some serious health hazards, which people can experience, due to prolonged exposure to bad air quality, claim doctors. Health experts urge Patnaites to take precautions not just outside, but in their houses as well to avoid air-borne health problems.""Air pollution can be ambient or household. /While the former occurs due to emission of smoke from vehicles and industries, the latter can be caused due to the use of air fresheners and house paints. Ambient air pollution is responsible for bronchitis, emphysema and lung cancer, whereas household pollution can cause cough, asthma and skin irritation,"" said city-based pulmonologist Dr Sanjay Kumar.Physician Dr Pratyush Kumar claimed that the average life expectancy would increase by 1.7 years if the air quality improved. ""People with tuberculosis should stay away from industrial areas as continuous exposure to unhealthy air can aggravate their disease,"" he said.Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences' (IGIMS) skin department associate professor Dr Kranti advised people to wear masks while going outside and eat protein-rich food. He explained, ""Proper diet and precautions can reduce the ill-effects of air pollution.""Some health-conscious Patnaites are trying their best to protect themselves from the hazards of pollution.

Experts worried over high level of pollution in cities,"Jaipur: The situation is gradually turning alarming in Jaipur and Jodhpur due to high pollution levels. These are the most-polluted cities of the state, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) report, which kept the two cities among 14 most-polluted cities of the world. The WHO had released the report last year having figures of 4,000 cities of 100 countries across the world. /For preparing the report, the WHO measured particle matter 2.5 (particles smaller than 2.5 microns) in different cities of the world. The WHO collected annual mean concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) includes pollutants, such as sulphate, nitrates and black carbon, which pose the greatest risks to human health. Major sources of air pollution from particulate matter include the inefficient use of energy by households, industry, the agriculture and transport sectors, and coal-fired power plants. In some regions, sand and desert dust, waste burning and deforestation are additional sources of air pollution, says the WHO report. Health experts are concerned over high pollution levels in important cities of the state. ""There are national and international studies showing that the top cause of death in the state is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which occurs due to high level of pollution. Mining, pollution, vehicular pollution and indoor pollution are playing havoc with the health of people,"" said Dr Virendra Singh, former superintendent, Sawai Man Singh hospital and specialist in pulmonary diseases.He said that immediate measures should be taken to prevent cities in the state to become gas chambers. Dr Singh said that more people are dying of COPD in the state in comparison to Coronary artery disease and any other disease such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, tuberculosis, Cardiovascular disease (CVD), road traffic injury. ""Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh in north India, both of which are in the low epidemiological transition level (ETL) state group, had the highest Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) rates of COPD and asthma in 2016,"" says study 'the burden of chronic respiratory diseases and their heterogeneity across the states of India: the global burden of disease study 1990-2016.

"PM2.5 snuffed out 30,000 lives in a year","Ahmedabad: Gujarat's air quality has been deteriorating and even if you don't have vices - like smoking or drinking - the poor air quality has already taken away 1.7 years from your life. That's the Lancet's Global Burden of Diseases report on air pollution which in its latest release on January 2 this year claimed that just in 2017, outdoor air pollution killed 29,791 people. The deaths are due to tiny deadly particulate matter (PM) of 2.5 microns and even smaller in size, that emanates from vehicular exhausts, industrial and thermal power plant chimneys. These fine particulates are so small that it can enter your bloodstream and lungs, causing problems like asthma, heart disease and stroke.Now if we were to scare you even more, then in Gujarat, the percentage of citizens facing danger from ambient particulate matter - PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 - is higher than the number of citizens smoking in Gujarat. /In the state, air pollution is the third leading cause of death and disability, accounting for 10.9%. Major Gujarat cities take the maximum brunt with 13% to 15% more vehicles being added every year across eight municipal corporations. Fumes from surrounding industrial clusters and burning garbage mounds like Pirana in Ahmedabad, Jambuva in Vadodara and Nakrawadi in Rajkot, are continuously posing a serious health challenge. Elsewhere in Gujarat, air pollution is also affecting crop quality. In 2015, a study by Mahatma Gandhi Chitrakoot Gramoday University of MP revealed that in Kodinar pollution by cement dust has caused adverse effects on the photosynthetic pigments of sesame, groundnut and wheat crops. Chlorophyll quantity reduced by 73% in case of sesame crop, 49% in case of groundnut and 12% in case of wheat in close proximity of the cement plant. Similarly, last month some 1,686 farmers growing Valsadi Hafoos (Alphonso) mangoes from Chikhli in Navsari and Vapi in Valsad suffered 50-80% loss and blamed it on air pollution from surrounding chemical industries. N U Patel, deputy director, horticulture, Valsad, told TOI, ""Mango farmers have suffered heavy loss and the yield has gone down drastically. Air pollution caused by the industries in the vicinity of these farms cannot be ruled out as the reason for this failure.""Globally too, Gujarat cities like Ahmedabad, in the latest Nature Conservancy Report, has figured as the seventh city among 245 cities that desperately require trees to control particulate matter pollution. Delhi, Mumbai are other two cities on the list. The ranking was arrived at based on Return of Investment (ROI) to the city on planting trees. The report states that Ahmedabad will have to spent Rs 277.11 per citizen on improving its green infrastructure to achieve sustainable levels.Over the past year, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has intervened several times to improve air quality of Gujarat cities and towns. In the case of Morbi - India's centre for ceramic manufacturing - more than 800 units were shut down and asked to dump coal-based gasifiers in March and asked to operate on LPG. Within 10 days of the order and GPCB crackdown, majority of these industries adopted gas connections. In Ahmedabad, NGT in December had asked the government to ensure that all 10-year and older vehicles be taken off city roads.Head: The air we breathe In Gujarat, air pollution is the third leading cause of death and disability, accounting for 10.9% of deaths19% Gujaratis face risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or progressive lung diseases, now the second leading cause of death accounting for 4.9% of deaths and disability in GujaratIn Gujarat, 15% population is exposed to occupational particulate matter - vehicular fumes, factories and open work spaces7.5% of the population is exposed to risks of ambient ozone pollutionOutdoor air pollution killed 29,791 citizens in Gujarat in 2017Household pollution due to burning hearth killed 24,169 citizens in poor households in urban and rural Gujarat(Source : Lancet Burden of Diseases report, 2019, ICMR) head: City ScanHealth of Gujarat towns and citiesCITY/TOWNAQIHEALTHPM2.5 concentration (microgram/cubic mt)Ahmedabad145Unhealthy53Gandhinagar154Unhealthy61.4Vadodara84Moderate29.9Surat81Moderate26.6Rajkot80Moderate25.8Gandhidham105Unhealthy for sensitive37.2Morbi84Moderate27.8Himmatnagar106Unhealthy for sensitive37.5Palanpur135Unhealthy for sensitive 49.4Patan131Unhealthy for sensitive 47.7Dahod106Unhealthy for sensitive 37.4Vapi62Moderate17.4Source : SAFAR and AirVisual (Global)Head: Tree is the keyCITIES THAT REQUIRE THE MOST TREES TO CONTROL AIR POLLUTIONCITIES ROI*Karachi, Pakistan10.97Dhaka, Bangladesh10.42Delhi, India6.65Faisalabad, Pakistan6.19Mumbai, India5.06Dakar, Senegal4.65Ahmedabad, India4.18Katmandu, Nepal3.98Cairo, Egypt3.63Freetown Sierra Leone3.47* ROI : Return of Investment For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Yoga, Naturopathy beneficial for Asthma","With the air we breathe getting hazardous day by day; the incidences of chronic lung diseases are also on the rise. Poor air quality and high concentrations of ground-level ozone have often been associated with both asthma development and increased asthma severity. Asthma-related death cases are much high in developing countries like India. /In fact, over 80 percent of asthma deaths occur in low and lower-middle-income countries, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Asthma is a chronic disease of the air passages of the lungs which inflames and narrows them. Diagnosis of the disease is based on symptoms, response to therapy over time, and lung function. Asthma triggers are everywhere in our environment. Modern medicine relies heavily on the use of steroid inhalation and anti-inflammatory drugs to manage the condition. However, the high cost of drugs and their potential side effects remain a cause of concern. A naturopathy based treatment, on the other hand, uses a non-pharmacological approach which is much safer and sustainable.Diagnosis is the first stepIf you have symptoms of respiratory disorders, seeing a doctor should be the first step because asthma attacks get severe at times. Even if you never had a fully fledged asthma attack but you are prone to respiratory allergies or recurrent and prolonged bouts of cold and cough, then also you should visit the doctor to test your lung function. Restore to natural careNaturopathy provides a holistic way of treating and managing a condition. They work to eliminate the cause and reduce the severity of disease from its roots. The therapeutic plan in naturopathy is executed in three phases - the eliminative phase which focuses on cleansing the body of accumulated toxins, the soothing and constructive phases in which the body's metabolic activity is regulated. To establish the efficacy of the naturopathy approach to prevent asthma attacks, a significant study was conducted at Jindal Naturecure Institute, Bangalore during the period 2003-2006 in which a total number of 60 patients from 25 years to 70 years were treated for bronchial asthma for 21 days as part of the research programme. Their treatment procedure was divided into three therapy sections - Nature cure therapy, Diet therapy, and Yoga therapy. After following the 21-days, a lot had changed. When Jindal Naturcure Institute began this study with 60 patients, there were only five cases that required no medication at the time of admission. However, during the discharge, the cases of no medication increased from 5 to 48. Further, the treatment proved out to have long-lasting effects on the majority of patients. Nearly two-thirds of the patients did not have to use any other medication as observed at different intervals during the period of one year.Prevention is better than cure While the causes and triggers vary from individual to individual, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends patients to prevent exposure to smoke, air pollution and chemical irritants including perfume. Other preventive measures include avoiding exposure to dust, furry pets, animal dander, dust mites, and molds. We must also collectively make an effort towards reducing vehicular pollution by adopting cleaner fuels and reducing our carbon footprints.by Dr H.

"Not outside, air inside your homes is more toxic","Nagpur: Neither transportation nor stubble burning, the single-largest source of air pollution in the country are millions of households burning solid fuel. According to a latest study by a group of expert institutions, India needs to completely mitigate household emissions to achieve its annual ambient air quality standard.Researchers from the University of California Berkeley, Cornell University, Max Planck Institute (Germany), Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, and Urban Emissions.info analysed seven scientific studies on contribution of toxic air from Indian houses to ambient air pollution.The findings, published by the Collaborative Clean Air Policy Centre and shared exclusively with TOI on the eve of World Environment Day, reveal that the contribution of household pollution in ambient air is 60% higher than coal sector, four times higher than open burning and 11 times higher than vehicular emissions. ""In India, indoor pollution gives rise to around 22-52% of ambient particulate matter 2.5. In contrast, other major sources like transport, power plants and industries contribute 2-10%, 8-15% and 8-11%, respectively,"" the study states.When solid fuels like wood, dung and agricultural waste are burned, one of the major pollutant emitted by the combustion is PM2.5, exposure to which causes severe health ailments including respiratory and heart diseases.Researchers have claimed that close exposure to the source of indoor pollution causes around 8 lakh premature deaths in the country. /""In addition to this, another 3 lakh deaths can be attributed to household pollution caused due to outdoor sources,"" the study states.After analysing different studies, researchers have inferred that formulation of extensive policies is needed to reduce indoor pollution in the country. ""While the government is promoting use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking, additional substitution of clean burning fuels for other residential uses like heating needs to be warranted. In states with low socio-demographic index like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Assam where about 72.1% people use solid fuels for cooking, mitigation programs are expected to harbour major health benefits,"" the study states.It further establishes that the percentage contribution of household air pollution in ambient PM2.5 is higher in eastern and north-eastern states. ""Indoor air pollution should be a sector of great concern for policymakers to obtain national ambient air quality standards,"" it adds.With seven scientific studies proving that indoor air pollution is a source of India's particulate air pollution crisis, researchers are of the view that new policies enabling households to switch away from solid fuels are needed.STUDY REVELATIONS * Indoor air pollution single largest air pollution in country* India needs to completely mitigate household emissions to achieve its annual ambient air quality standard* Indoor pollution gives rise to around 22-52% of ambient particulate matter 2.5* Contribution of household pollution: 60% greater than coal sector, 4 times greater than open burning and 11 times higher than vehicular emissions* Causes around 8 lakh pre-mature deaths in the country* New policies enabling to switch from solid fuels needed For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"No alternatives for 'Vikrams', cause of pollution, traffic snarls in city","Dehradun:  Sudden turns, jerky stops and a complete disregard for traffic rules are what define the 'Vikarms' - the blue-coloured three-wheelers, which are one of the major modes of transport in the city, Despite being the major contributors to traffic jams and pollution, one can't also wish them away. As taking these vehicles, which offer cheap rides, off the road is not an option, authorities try to keep them in check through occasional crack-downs.Both residents and officials agree that Vikram drivers make sudden swerves without any indication and park at some of the most inconvenient spaces, leading to traffic snarls. ""Even when the traffic light is green, they stop at signals to pick or drop a passenger. They hardly use indicators and press breaks so abruptly that it causes a minor accident every time,"" said Arjun Bisht, a resident of Ballupur.Residents said that not only were Vikrams responsible for traffic jams, they also caused air pollution. /""Most of these vehicles are too old and leave behind a trail of black smoke. Though it is mandatory for them to undergo regular pollution checks, a random survey would reveal that none of them do it,"" said Ankit Singh, a resident of Jogiwala.The Vikrams were introduced on city roads in the 1970s. In the beginning, they were a modest mode of transport and there were only a few dozen of them. However as the city expanded, so did their number. According to data available with the Regional Transport Office (RTO), there are 794 registered Vikrams plying on 18 routes across the city right now. Most of them operate on the nine main routes. The extent of traffic rules they break can be gauged by the fact that in just a three-day drive, the RTO managed to fine over 200 Vikrams. That said, one cannot ignore the fact that these unruly vehicles, which offer rides for Rs 5 to Rs 15, are also the lifeline of a lot of cummuters. ""The Vikrams are the only last-mile connectivity option for most residents in the city. The number of buses in the city is so low that many of us have to rely on these Vikrams. Also, the fare they charge is minimal, which is why they are preferred by those who cannot afford to take cabs,"" said Neha Bhardwaj, a resident of Raipur.Meanwhile, Vikram drivers claim that had the administration fixed designated stops for them, they wouldn't have to park at random places. ""None of us have any objections to having designated stops. In fact, we have even asked the RTO and the traffic department to do something about it but they haven't. We are here to earn a living and we stop in the middle of the road because we have to pick and drop the passengers. If the government allots designated spots, we will happily comply,"" said Rajender Kumar, the general secretary of Vikram Jankalyan Sewa Samiti, a union which claims to consist of 2,000 Vikarm drivers. The traffic department and the RTO said that the administration was conducting regular drives to manage the situation. They said police had been deployed at major bottlenecks to clear any jam-like situation. ""We know that Vikrams are a major cause of traffic jams but they are also a common mode of transport. We cannot take them off the road just like that. All we can do is penalise offenders from time to time. Our personnel are deployed at major intersections where there are possibilities of traffic jams,"" said SP traffic Prakash Chandra. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Kolkatans at greater risk than Delhites:ACS,"Kolkata: The air in Kolkata is much more foul and poses a greater risk to your health than even Delhi's. This sobering admission came on the eve of World Environment Day from the seniormost bureaucrat in Bengal in charge of environmental issues, additional chief secretary Indivar Pandey.""Delhi's poor air quality index (AQI) is driven by particulate matter (PM)10, which is coarser. It is bad but is not as harmful as the much finer PM2.5 pollutants that drive Kolkata's AQI. The severity of air pollution in Kolkata is limited to winter but it is quite damaging in those four-five months,"" Pandey said on Tuesday.Green activists welcomed the government's shift in stance from self-denial to a candid admission of facts. ""How can we fight the problem if we don't recognise that there is a problem?""/ asked Somendra Mohan Ghosh, an expert on auto emission (which is one of the key sources of PM2.5 pollutants that comprise particles smaller than 2.5 micrometres. They are approximately 1/30th the average width of human hair and can travel straight into the lung and from there to the blood stream and be extremely harmful to human health. PM10 pollutants, on the other hand, cannot go beyond our nasal cavity.""Delhi, being the national capital, gets global attention but Kolkata's approach to finding solutions is piecemeal and ineffective,"" environmentalist Subhas Dutta, who has initiated many legal battles for cleaner air in Kolkata, said.The health impact of the worsening AQI is telling. Around 70% of the city's inhabitants suffer from respiratory disorder and 47% have severe lower respiratory track infection and lung cancer, a study by the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI), the state environment department and the Central Poluution Control Board (CPCB) has revealed. Another study by the Chittaranjan National Cancer Research Institute (CNCRI) has found that over 60% children in Kolkata have lung function impairments.Doctors say the toxicity in the air is evident from the higher incidence of respiratory diseases. ""Hospital admission of patients with acute asthma trebled this winter (November 2018 to February 2019) compared to last summer (April-July 2018) because of worsening seasonal AQI,"" consultant respiratory physician Raja Dhar said.Morning walkers are particularly vulnerable in winter with the high PM2.5 count making the air heavy with toxins. ""By breathing in polluted air today, the lung gets damaged tomorrow and the liver is affected the day after. It's a chain-reaction triggered by PM2.5, which needs to be stopped by radical changes in the way we live,"" consultant pulmonologist Sushmita Roychoudhuri said.A recent study has pointed to alarming levels of respiratory disorder in Behala and Ultadanga, areas that are choked by dense traffic. Around 85% of respondents in the study suffered from respiratory disorders; 60% had acute respiratory infection (ARI). Genetic scientist Mrinmoy Chanda says pollution plays a role in city's infant mortality rate as well.Officials say the state environment department and the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) have adopted a comprehensive air quality management approach; the state environment department will coordinate and monitor the action plans of different departments that directly or indirectly cause pollution. This, hope officials, will give Kolkata cleaner air by the next World Environment Day. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Plant trees and save the planet: Celebs on World Environment Day,"On World Environment Day, celebs and politicians came together to emphasise on the importance of planting trees for a better and greener planet. Bollywood actors Jackie Shroff and Randeep Hooda and former Indian cricket captain Kapil Dev joined Prakash Javadekar, Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and Minister of Information and Broadcasting, to plant saplings in the premises of Indira Paryavaran Bhawan in Jor Bagh.All the celebs attending the event agreed to the fact that it's necessary to promote the practice of tree planting to save the planet and combat rising temperatures, air pollution and even diseases. Keeping these in mind, the MoEFCC has launched a #SelfieWithSapling campaign, urging people to plant a sapling and click a selfie with it. Hailing Jackie Shroff and Kapil Dev as the two heroes of his generation, Prakash Javadekar urged Delhiites to become a hero by planting trees.Jackie Shroff, who is known to keep plants in his car, came ready for the occasion 'Aisa plant lagao jo raat ko bhi oxygen de'Flaunting a tropical print shirt, apt for the occasion, Jackie Shroff - who is known to keep plants in his car and posts poems on plants on Instagram - said in his trademark style, ""Yeh sab bade log yahan aaye hain subah ko yeh batane ki jhaad (plants) lagao. /Aap logon ko samajhna chahiye, bheedu.

Biomass cooking for 4 hours = inhaling 10-100 cigarettes: Expert,"Nagpur: At a time when more than half of Indians rely on solid fuels for cooking, experts have stated that smoke emitted from cooking for four hours in a day using biomass is equivalent to inhaling over 10-100 cigarettes in terms of carcinogens.This was highlighted by former assistant director of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute Dr Manas Ranjan Ray during the World Environment Day programme held at the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) on Thursday. On Wednesday, TOI had reported about a scientific research which stated that millions of households in the country are single-largest source of air pollution. Stating that the country was suffering more from indoor air pollution than outdoor, Ray said that as much as 85% of air pollution is from households, while only 15% is from outdoor sources. /""It is a misconception that biomass is less polluting. In fact, burning biomass is more toxic than kerosene,"" he said. Highlighting other sources of household pollution, the expert said, ""Burning one coil of mosquito repellent is equivalent to 100 cigarettes. While the composition of particulate matter emitted from cigarettes is 10mg/g in cigarettes, it is 45 milligrams per gram (mg/g) in incense sticks.""Electronic gadgets and personal care products containing 'paraben' and other toxic compounds also lead to household air pollution, Dr Ray added.While PM10 and PM2.5 are widely known pollutants causing health ailments, the lesser-talked about ultra-fine particles are the most dangerous. Said the expert, ""Less than 0.1 microns, these particles are the deadliest. After being deposited in the lungs, the inhaled pollutants can enter the bloodstream and attack any body, including the brain.""Not just respiratory ailments, air pollution is responsible for various other diseases. During his talk on the health aspects of air pollution, Dr Ray explained how right from hypertension, cardiac arrest to mental diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinsons - the menace of pollution is widespread. ""Our research has shown that pollution is also responsible for causing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder among children. Moreover, it is even dangerous for an unborn child as pollutants can easily travel through the umbilical cord to the foetus,"" he said.The expert added that toxic air also harms the female reproductive system, leading to various complications in menstrual cycle and pregnancy. During the event, chief scientist and head of Climate Change division JS Pandey highlighted the urgency to act upon global warming. Senior principal scientist at Neeri Dr Padma Rao, who also heads the Air Pollution and Control Division, said that the actions plans for about ten non-attainment cities of the state have been submitted.Chief scientist Hemant Purohit said that the significant increase in energy consumption is a major cause of pollution. ""From 400 billion kilowatt per hour in 2000, it has now gone up to 2,000 billion kilowatt per hour. Development is at its peak in the country and we should have a mitigation plan for 2030 ready to provide us a road map in abating environmental crisis,"" he said.

"KMC, RTO & 15 other depts to table concrete plan to combat air pollution","Kanpur: The district administration has asked 17 government establishments, including Kanpur Municipal Corporation, Kesco, RTO and Regional Pollution Control Board to present plans for combating air pollution as it was giving a bad name to the city.District magistrate Kanpur Nagar Vijay Vishwas Pant asked the officials to be present with concrete plan to combat air pollution at a meeting scheduled to be held at Collectorate auditorium on June 10.Notably, activism of the National Green Tribunal has forced various government organizations to become active on the issue of air and water pollution. Recently, NGT issued notices to 15 cities of the state that have been termed as ""most air polluted"" and asked them to identify the causes of air pollution and eradicate them.According to officials, NGT and Regional Pollution Control Board have chalked out a master plan upto 2021 and have started acting upon it. Under the plan, it has been decided to control the fumes emitting from burning garbage, vehicles, incinerators, industrial units and generators.Regional Pollution Control Board officials said main cause of air pollution in the city was dust and smoke emanating from vehicles, including outdated vehicles. /""Another major reason is burning of garbage due to which particulate matter (P.M. 2.5 and 10 ) contents of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen di-oxide, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide is more than stipulated standard which is injurious for human health,"" officials said.WHO global database released in Geneva last year had claimed that Kanpur was among the worst in terms of PM 2.5 concentration (173 micrograms per cubic metre), followed by Faridabad, Varanasi and Gaya.According to WHO data, Nine in 10 people in the world breathe polluted air. In another statement, WHO had claimed that seven million people die every year because of outdoor and household air pollution. Ambient air pollution alone caused some 4.2 million deaths in 2016 while household air pollution from cooking with polluting fuels and technologies caused an estimated 3.8 million deaths in the same period, the report stated.

We wish to inform around 3 lakh IT workers in Hinjewadi about the quality of air they are breathing.""Rohit Halbe, member, HIRWA, said the devices are the size of an internet modem and have to be placed at locations from where air quality can be monitored. The device sends the air pollution levels to servers from where the readings are accessible to people who have the AQI app.Halbe added that residents can be warned through social media in case of high pollution levels and advisories issued to them to remain indoors. Halbe said that they also plan to install the air sensors at Baner and Wakad.Karthik Ganesan, a research fellow with CEEW, said: ""Low-cost sensors were installed as residents were concerned about bad air quality. Our focus is to create a demand for better air quality.""Authorities responsible for areas under the IT park are the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA), district collector, and Zilla Parishad.

AMC to impose Rs 50k as fine for dispersal of dust at construction sites,"Agra: In a bid to curb air pollution caused by dust arising due to construction work, Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) authorities have decided to take strict action against those responsible. Now, construction work in city areas causing emission of dust in the air will invite a penalty of Rs 50,000. For the purpose, civic body administration has tasked engineers and field officials to identify and inspect construction sites to check whether the guidelines set by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) are being followed.According to the civic body officials, it is mandatory to spray water every day to suppress dust re-suspension at construction sites. All construction and demolition debris and building material need to be covered when stored or while they are being transported. /Barricades should be raised along the perimeter of construction or demolition sites. Shade net, tarpaulin or plastic sheet can be used for scaffolding. Several other guidelines laid down by the NGT are required to be followed during construction and demolition.The civic body's chief engineer has issued directives to all executive, assistant and junior engineers to ensure enforcement of NGT guidelines on dust mitigation after it surfaced that these were not being followed in the handling of construction material and demolition debris and at construction sites.In this regard, municipal commissioner has directed that strict action be taken against those found violating the NGT norms.AMC chief engineer AK Singh said, ""As per NGT orders, any person, owner and or builder found to be violating guidelines on dust mitigation measures shall be liable to pay a compensation of Rs. 50,000 per default in relation to the construction activity at the site and Rs.5,000 for each violation during carriage and transportation of constriction material and debris through trucks or other vehicles under provisions of the NGT Act.""Environmentalist and doctor by profession, Sharad Gupta said, ""Dust generated during construction and demolition work releases a wide range of particle sizes and material types that can affect health and cause problems ranging from eye, nose and throat irritation to problems in the respiratory system. Dispersal of particulate matter (PM) is a major reason behind increasing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Abundance of PM 2.5 and 10 in the air also cause harm to the Taj Mahal.""As per an official estimate, on an average, 150 tonnes per day of debris is dumped on city roads.

Survey on traffic personnel's health raises pollution alarm,"Kolkata: A recent study among Bidhannagar traffic police personnel again vindicated the fact that breathing city's air, particularly in winter, is worse than smoking cigarettes. Majority of personnel with abnormal pulmonary function test (PFT) results were found to be non-smokers. The average age of these personnel is 30 years.Such abnormal PFT at this age is prevalent only in case of heavy smokers, said an expert. /""These results are very worrying and abnormalities are remarkably high. The results urge the policy makers and citizens of Kolkata to take immediate steps to reduce air pollution,"" said Dr Sugato Roy Chowdhury, consultant physical medicine at Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, who led the study for the hospital, along with city-based environment group Kolkata Clean Air.Among 333 participants - mostly traffic constables and civic volunteers from nine traffic guards (TGs or traffic police stations) - who underwent the PFT, 17% were detected with abnormal PFT results. More than 60% of the participants with abnormal PFT results are non-smokers. The traffic police personnel are exposed to high vehicular emission. Significantly, these zones, where these personnel undertake their traffic management duty, are not among the worst polluted zones of the city.""Pulmonary function tests are non-invasive tests that show how well the lungs are working. The tests measure lung volume, capacity, rates of flow and gas exchange. People with abnormal PFT pump in oxygen much less than what the body demands. There begins a series of health issues,"" said Roy Chowdhury.Among the participants, 24% personnel attached with Lake Town and Baguiati traffic guards were found to have abnormal PFT. While 18% of Bidhannagar and Nabadiganta traffic guard personnel had abnormal PFT results, the figure was 16% for New Town and Rajarhat traffic guard personnel. The results were better for Airport, Kaikhali and NSCBI traffic guard personnel, where the figure was as low as 9%.Ajay Mittal of Kolkata Clean Air said data from CPCB and WBPCB last winter shows that Kolkata is the most polluted metro in India.

Water of five villages near Bandhwari plant to be tested,"Gurgaon: The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), a central agency, on Monday started the collection of groundwater, soil and air samples from five villages near the Bandhwari landfill to carry out tests to determine contamination.The institute is collecting samples from Bandhwari, Gwalpahari, Baliawas, Mandi and Kot villages after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) issued a direction to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in this regard last month. CPCB handed over the responsibility to NEERI.The NGT had come down heavily on the Haryana government and directed authorities to carry out a damage impact study and test groundwater samples in Bandhwari and other surrounding areas for contamination due to the landfill.Interestingly, apart from testing groundwater, the institute will analyse bio-aerosols - minute biological particles - in the air and soil. ""Bio-aerosols around a landfill site act as a source of microbiological air pollution. /There have been many studies indicating presence of bio-aerosols near municipal waste landfill sites. We're going to analyse samples not just for groundwater contamination, but also air pollution and soil contamination,"" a NEERI official said. The institute is going to collect groundwater samples from several tubewells in the villages.According to some studies, exposure to bio-aerosols is associated with a wide range of health hazards, including infectious diseases, acute toxic effects, allergies and cancer.This is the first time that groundwater of Gwal Pahari, Kot, Baliawas and Mandi will be tested. Vaishali Rana Chandra, an environment activist, who requested groundwater testing of these four villages, said, ""I am glad that the authorities have addressed our demands. The situation is quite alarming not just in Bandhwari but many villages in the immediate vicinity of the landfill."" She also requested the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) to carry out groundwater testing of the four villages.""Every time the issue is raised in the green tribunal, the court directs authorities to carry out tests. Many tests have been conducted in the last five years. CPCB, the Centre's top body, itself termed the groundwater of Bandhwari and Mangar unfit for drinking in 2017. However, it seems that the green tribunal didn't find CPCB's reports reliable enough. If we continue to carry out tests like this, the landfill will cause further damage and we will never come to a conclusion to work out a solution,"" said Vivek Kamboj, who filed a petition to NGT over reallocation of the Bandhwari waste treatment plant from the Aravalis.More than 1,600 tonnes of mixed waste is dumped at the Bandhwari waste treatment plant daily.

City's residential areas more polluted: PCB report,"Kanpur: Air pollution in some residential areas of the city is far more than the commercial places, according to a report presented by the regional pollution control board.Dust emitting from broken or dug up roads, garbage burning, smoke emission from old and outdated vehicles and unprotected building construction are the main reasons for high air pollution in the residential localities such as Kidwai Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Baconganj, Bada Chauraha, Moolganj etc, said Ghanshyam Dwivedi, official of regional pollution control board.Talking to TOI, he said, ""Earlier, it was the impression that air pollution was more in commercial areas but, after pollution control board's report, it was found that several residential localities have left commercial areas behind in air pollution"".The instrument to measure air pollution installed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) at Brahmanagar near Gumti can measure PM 2.5 and PM 10, and its capacity to cover the area is around 500 metres, said the official. Besides, regional pollution control board had also installed manual air pollution measuring instruments at residential areas including Kidwai Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Dada Nagar, IIT campus, Kalyanpur, Rama Devi and Jareeb Chowki, Dwivedi further said.Recently, regional pollution control board New Delhi, had identified 15 cities of UP as 'non- attainment' cities due to high air pollution. The cities are Lucknow, Agra, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Noida, Khurja, Firozabad, Anpara, Gajraula, Jhansi, Mordabad, Rai Bareli, Bareilly and Kanpur Nagar.He said the central pollution control board had also chalked out an action plan for these cities and asked the DMs to implement the plan. /DM Kanpur Nagar, Vijay Vishwas Pant, had recently convened a meeting of officials of pollution control board, KMC, RTO and other departments and asked them to work to tackle air pollution.Explaining the short term plan, the DM said, ""Raids should be conducted by KDA and KMC on under-constructed buildings to know whether their owners or contractors have taken steps to check pollution"". Road cutting is another major reason of rising air pollution. There should also be some coordination between the departments, he added.The DM has directed the RTO department to take action against old and obsolete vehicles and smoke emitting vehicles being plied on roads. Similarly, KMC should take effective measures to check garbage burning in the open. Raids should also be made in industrial areas to control air quality, he said.

"Only nine monitors to check air pollution, PCB comes under flak","Vijayawada: According to a study conducted by Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) and the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), the Particulate Matter (PM 10) levels have increased in the city since the time Vijayawada and Guntur were made the capital region of Andhra Pradesh.The Data of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) shows that the PM 10 levels in Vijayawada back in 2011 ranged between 85 g/m3 and that it gradually touched the mark of 100 g/m3 in the year 2013-14. Further, in 2014-15, the levels of PM 10 in Vijayawada saw a sudden jump to 98 g/m3 from 80 g/m3 while that of Guntur shot to 97 g/m3 during the same period. The analysis conducted by the CSE with the data of APPCB highlighted that PM 10 levels are high during summer in Vijayawada. Officials of APPCB said that they are analyzing the sudden change in particulate matter in the city as the density of population has increased in recent time. /However, the APPCB is lacking far behind in monitoring the air pollution levels. There are only 9 monitors in Vijayawada to analyze the air pollution levels and out of them, only one monitor in real-time. So the officials are now eyeing to install two additional monitors in the city as the population has touched 14.91 lakh mark.Moreover, the city doctors opine that the PM 2.5 levels are dangerous and that the locals need to be more cautious. ""Breathing polluted air is health hazardous. Air pollution is ranked as the fourth-highest risk factor in 2016 and many premature deaths due to air pollution were reported in AP. Respiratory infection becomes quite common in cities like Vijayawada. High levels of PM 10 are dangerous, but PM 2.5 levels are more dangerous as the microparticles will open the doors for the heart diseases,"" Dr Sumanth, a city-based cardiologist said.Smaller the size of particulate matter higher the risk of lung disorders. High exposure to the particulate matter will cause non-fatal heart attacks, aggravated asthma, and others, he added.Left parties have alleged that improper disposal of solid wastes by the civic body has been the major reason for the air pollution and breathing disorders in areas like at Ajith Singh Nagar and Vambey colony areas in the city. ""Improper solid waste management is the major reason for air pollution in the city. City-outskirt areas are affected by the smoke emitting from the burning garbage. Officials should take stringent action on sanitation staff burning garbage,"" said CH Babu Rao, CPM secretariat member. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Women too vulnerable to lung cancer: Docs,"Madurai: The notion that lung cancer occurs predominantly among men does not hold true as a notable percentage of women too suffer from the disease, say doctors here. However, they also add that the survival rate of people with lung cancer is significantly high if treated at a very early stage.The doctors were speaking at Vadamalayan Hospitals where three procedures were performed on as many patients - two of whom were women - with lung cancer in the last one month alone. Consultant surgical oncologist at the hospital Dr S Alagu Ganesh said there was a general conception that only smoking could increase the risk of lung cancer, which was not the case. /""Since only smoking is perceived by the general public to be the only reason for lung cancer, they think only men are at higher risk,"" he said. Dr Ganesh added that though the exact cause for lung cancer among women could not be determined in many cases, the possible reasons could be air pollution caused by firewood stove, industrial pollution, genetic mutation and even hereditary. The doctors also said that at Vadamayalan Hospitals, about 30% to 40% of patients with lung cancer constituted women.The experts said that while the overall five-year survival rate was about 18%, if detected and treated early, it could go up by 60% to 70%. ""When an elderly person repeatedly coughs, it is often considered to be only due to old age. But if it's recurring, then they should be checked sooner,"" chief cardiothoracic surgeon Dr P Babu said. The three who underwent lung resections at the hospital last month included a 34-year-old woman with carcinoma in the left lung, 70-year-old man with right lower lobectomy and a 74-year-old woman with left lower lobectomy. The doctors said the surgeries were successful and they were able to send the patients home. The doctors also said that every year 1.61 million new cases of lung cancer were reported out of which 1.38million died, making lung cancer the leading cause of cancer-related mortality.
