"Among 10 most polluted places in the Rajasthan, 3 are in Jaipur: Study","JAIPUR: In an indication that people of the state breathe polluted air for most part of the year, the cities in Rajasthan have recorded a particulate matter (PM) 2.5 concentration more than the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) safe limits of 40 ug/ m3 with only a few exceptions.For the first four months (January-April) of this year too, all the monitored cities of -Ajmer, Alwar, Bhiwadi, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota, Udaipur and Pali have seen a PM 2.5 concentration of more than safe limits of 40 ug/m3 and more than triple the WHO limits of 10 ug/m3, according to National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), the country's flagship programme for better air quality in 122 cities, launched in 2019.Out of the 10 most-polluted locations, three are in Jaipur - police commissionerate, Shastri Nagar and Adarsh Nagar.Sahil Singal, a naturopathy doctor and environmentalist, said, ""The burning of garbage and diesel vehicles without pollution checks are a major contributor of air pollution in cities. There should be strict regulation and implementation to stem air pollution. Besides, non-motorised vehicles should be promoted to reduce carbon footprint.""""In 2020, while the country was in a complete lockdown from March-June, the cities of Jodhpur and Bhiwadi did not see pollution levels within permissible limits even once,""said the report.The city of Bhiwadi, which is part of Delhi-NCR and home to a range of large, medium and small-scale industries, from steel mills and furnaces to automobile and electronics manufacturing, is among the most polluted in the state with high PM 2.5, PM 10 and NO2 concentration throughout the three years (2019- June 2021).Among the operational Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) in the state, the highest monthly average PM 2.5 concentration of 103 ug/ m3 was reported at Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation in Bhiwadi.According to an assessment by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) and the Rajasthan Pollution Control Board in December 2020, the Bhiwadi Industrial Area contributes around 65% to the industrial pollution load of the region (Jaipur-Alwar-Bhiwadi air shed). Bhiwadi has a total of 328 air polluting industries.A source apportionment study done by IIT-Kanpur in Jaipur in January 2020 showed that while 47% of the PM 2.5 consists of road dust, vehicular emissions and industries contribute 20% and 19% respectively.According to Global Burden of Disease 2017, Rajasthan recorded the maximum number of child mortality which is 126 per lakh due to air pollution. /For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Smoking, climate change may trigger risk of lung cancer: Doctors","BHOPAL: Climate change, smoking and long term impact of Covid-19 pandemic could spurt an increase in lung cancer cases, according to experts. World Lung Cancer Day is August 1, a movement to defeat lung cancer and educate people on the risks and importance of early detection through screenings is vital.During the pandemic, many patients were hit with pulmonary fibrosis. In such patients, the probability of lung cancer has increased. /However, it takes over a decade for the fibrosis to become cancerous, said Gandhi Medical College (GMC) HoD medicine, pulmonologist and Hamidia hospital superintendent, Dr Lokendra Dave.The danger that causes lung cancer is environmental exposure to tobacco, radiation and cold dust. ""People with poor lung condition due to tobacco and smoking and later diagnosed with Covid-19 should be extremely cautious,"" he added.Stringent measures to tackle air pollution, one of the main factors causing lung damage, have to be addressed. Bhopal has over 100 real time air pollution testing devices installed through Bhopal smart city project. The information from these towers should be publicly available and youngsters in school and colleges, be educated on using these tools, said Dr Rajiv Singh.The Global Youth Tobacco Survey, India indicates that 14.6% of 13 -15 year-old students in India use tobacco. According to the MoHFW, nearly 37% children in India initiate smoking before the age of 10, and, each day 5500 children begin tobacco use and consequently may become addicted.A state level workshop on 'Big Tobacco Tiny Targets Study' is being held in Bhopal on August 3 to present the outcome of the study and to discuss possible action to prevent children from becoming tobacco users.

Pandemic control efforts leads to less pollution: ESR,"Pune: Reduced vehicular traffic and other measures introduced for controlling Covid-19 pandemic have helped in checking air pollution too, bringing down the PM10 (by 38%) and PM2.5 (by 25%) levels to a decade low, stated the 2020-2021 Environmental Status Report (ESR) of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). Both PM10 and PM2.5 dropped below the permissible standards prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in PMC limits in 2020-2021, the report showed.""Though a dip was expected due to the lockdown, it was mostly based on mathematical models. The actual closure has led to real-time quantification of the drop. It was significant,"" said Mangesh Dighe, environment officer of PMC, while speaking to TOI. /The ESR was presented before the general body on Friday.The data shows PM10 has seen a 30 g/m3 drop as it has gone down from 80 g/m3 to 50 g/m3. The decline in PM2.5 was from 40 g/m3 to 30 g/m3. The standard for PM10 and PM2.5 are 60 g/m3 and 40 g/m3, respectively. The comparison was done between PM levels in April-May 2019 and April-May 2020.As per heath experts, high presence of suspended particulate matter makes the air polluted. These particles are dangerous for the respiratory systems as they cause many air borne diseases.The report states a 39% dip in the number of vehicle registration in 2020 as compared to 2019. This too has contributed to the drop in vehicular pollution.The report states that there was a decline in the consumption of electricity due to the closure of industrial estates and commercial places during the lockdown and has contributed to reducing pollution.

Centre accepts PGI inputs on ways to counter illnesses caused by air pollution,"<a href=""mailto:Shimona.Kanwar@timesgroup.comChandigarh"">Shimona.Kanwar@timesgroup.comChandigarh</a>/: The ministry of health and family welfare has accepted the ""National health adaptation plan on air pollution,"" prepared for states/UTs by PGI, which was recently recognised as the centre of excellence on air pollution related illnesses. The plan envisages identification of vulnerable areas (using AQI) and vulnerable population, besides preparing a disease calendar. Union minister of health and family welfare, Mansukh Mandaviya and Dr Bharati Pawar, minister of state, unveiled the 'National health adaptation plans on air pollution"" along with infographics on air pollution and health during the 112thannual day celebrations of the National Centre for Disease Control. /The Health Adaptation Plan on Air Pollution and infographics were developed under the ""National programme on climate change and human health."" Institutions which played a key role in development of the plan and infographics include the department of community medicine and school of public Health, PGIMER; department of environment studies, Panjab University, Chandigarh; AIIMS, New Delhi and V P Patel Chest, New Delhi along with the Centre of environmental and occupational health, climate change and health at NCDC, New Delhi. Through graphic visual representation, the plan has been prepared as a handbook that outlines the role of health professionals in tackling air pollution related health problems. ""We have been able to convey through visuals the impact of air pollution on health and how the health sector should be prepared for it,"" said Dr Ravindra Khaiwa from PGI. He prepared the handbook along with Dr Suman Mor from Panjab University. Expressing his appreciation, Mandaviya said in his message, that the documents focus on addressing health issues due to air pollution-related illnesses, including cardiopulmonary and allergic health problems. He mentioned that these documents would help and guide states/UTs on how the health sector could coordinate with non-health sectors while addressing challenging health problems arising due to exposure to air pollution and at different levels of air quality index (AQI).The plan suggests setting up of a committee on air pollution and health in the hospital, to preferably involve health officials from the departments of medicine, respiratory, medicine, paediatrics, cardiology, neurology, endocrinology etc, including emergency and nursing department. It also highlights the need for preparations for logistics, drugs and equipment that may be required to address such health problems, particularly respiratory and cardiovascular emergencies. The plan highlights the need for identification of vulnerable areas, selection of air pollution hotspots as per AQI levels, vulnerable population less covering peoople less than five years of age, adolescents, pregnant women and the elderly. It also recommends surveillance on illness to help understand health problems in the area, conduct vulnerability mapping and prepare a disease calendar. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air pollution doubles in Aug, thanks to dry spell, road dust","Bhopal: Absence of showers and flying of dust due to damaged roads increased air pollution to more than double in a fortnight in major cities of Madhya Pradesh.Air quality index of Bhopal on August 1 was 47 that rose to 94 on August 16. In Indore AQI was also 47 on August 1 that went up to 83 on August 16.In Gwalior the AQI was 32 on August 1 that went up to 96 on August 16 while in Jabalpur AQI was 41 on August 1 that rose to 78 on August 16, as per the central pollution control board. Air quality index between 0 and 50 is termed as good with minimal possible health impacts while air quality between 51 and 100 is satisfactory but may lead to minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people. Air quality above 100 is moderate and leads to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. /AQI above 200 leads to breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Officials said the air quality remained best during the showers.Officials said, dust gets heavy in showers and does not fly in the air. The vehicular pollution also gets down as tyres could not lead to flying of pollutants and dust in air, as it settles down on ground. It is the reason why pollution levels come down during rains.Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, the increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage, among others.Officials said PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Average PM10 level this August highest in 3 years,"Noida: Although the overall pollution levels this month have remained low, the average PM10 levels for August have been higher compared to the past two years.PM10 is a determining pollutant in calculating Air Quality Index (AQI) of a place. While the average level was 78 g/m3 in August 2019, it went down to 66 last year. But from August 1 to 24 this year, the average PM10 level has been 110. For PM10, the safe level is below 100 g/m3.PM10 is made of particulate matter in the air that includes smoke and dust. /The other determining factor is PM2.5 that includes emissions from power plants and automobile exhaust.In the past two weeks, PM10 levels rose on the days it did not rain. At Sector 62 and Knowledge Park 3 monitoring stations, the PM10 levels were in the safe limits for three days in the past one week (August 21-23).""Usually, it stops raining by the end of August. But this time, we are still getting some rain. Pollution levels dip when it rains as the dust settles. Although the monsoon has stretched over a longer period this time, we have hardly seen days with heavy showers. That is the reason why the overall pollution level has been higher this monsoon compared to the past few years,"" said a senior official from the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB).According to officials, in order to understand the pollution levels, airshed (dispersion of emissions) data has to be analysed, along with rainfall. ""Studying the source of pollution in airsheds will tell us why the levels are so high in this region and which specific pollutants need to be controlled. Source determination can be the key to reduce pollution levels,"" said Praveen Kumar, the regional officer, UPPCB, Noida. He added that the state government is planning to hire an independent agency that will determine the sources of air pollution in Gautam Budh Nagar and some other districts. The agency is likely to be finalised by next month.On Wednesday, the AQI in Noida was 115 (moderate). Between August 20 and 23 when it rained, the city's AQI remained in the good or moderate levels.Usually, pollution levels go up from September and they remain high through the winter.

People in Maharashtra can lose 2.5-2.9 years of life expectancy due to air quality: Report,"MUMBAI: Since 1998, the average annual particulate pollution in India has increased 15 per cent, cutting 5.9 years off the life of the average resident over those years. Now, nearly 40 per cent of India's population is exposed to pollution levels not seen in any other country, with 510 million residents of northern India on track to lose 8.5 years of life expectancy on an average, if pollution levels persist, reveals an air quality life index (AQLI) report released by Energy Policy Institute, University of Chicago (EPIC) this morning. India is listed as the most polluted country in the world with 480 million living in the indo-gangetic plain (IGP) as the most impacted as air pollution levels ""exceed those found anywhere else in the world by an order of magnitude"". As per the report, 40 per cent of the country's population is expected to lose more than 9 years of their life if pollution levels persist as they were in 2019, including residents of megacities like Delhi and Mumbai. Pollution has now expanded beyond the IGP to states like MP, Maharashtra where average people are losing additional 2.5-2.9 years of life expectancy relative to early 2000, said the report.The AQLI is a pollution index that translates particulate air pollution into perhaps the most important metric that exists: its impact on life expectancy. /Developed by the University of Chicago's Milton Friedman Distinguished Service Professor in Economics Michael Greenstone and his team at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), the AQLI quantifies the causal relationship between long-term human exposure to air pollution and life expectancy. The Index also illustrates how air pollution policies can increase life expectancy when they meet the WHO or national AQ standards.It may be recalled that a recent study by Utkal University, Bhubaneswar, IITM-Pune, National Technology Institute Rourkela and IIT Bhubaneswar published in the Elsevier Journal had stated that cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, and Ahmedabad experienced the highest number of Covid-19 cases and casualties between March and November 2020 owing to higher pollution levels involving PM 2.5 emission loads.According to the report, an average life expectancy would be higher by 5.6 years in the four South Asian countries -- India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal -- if they complied with WHO standards, the report pointed out. In comparison, threats from other health risks like smoking, for instance, reduces life expectancy in these countries by as much as 1.8 years; unsafe water and sanitation by as much as 1.2 years; and alcohol and drug use by about a year of lost life years in the South Asian countries.In 2019, India's average particulate matter concentration was 70.3 g/m 3 -the highest in the world and seven times the WHO's guideline of 10 g/m3 . Air pollution shortens average Indian life expectancy by 5.9 years, relative to what it would be if the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline was met; and 3.0 years relative to what it would be if pollution were reduced to meet the country's own national standard of 40ug/m3. Some areas of India fare much worse than average, with air pollution shortening lives by 9.7 years in Delhi and 9.5 years in Uttar Pradesh, the most polluted state. All of India's 1.3 billion people live in areas where the annual average particulate pollution level exceeds the WHO guideline. What is particulate pollution?Air has suspended particulate matter (PM) of different sizes. Many of these are a complex mixture of dust, pollen, soot and smoke and they are hazardous. Of this, PM 2.5 is the smaller kind, with a diameter not more than 2.5 micrometers (fine particles). The carcinogenic PM2.5 is considered to have a very significant health impact as it can stay in the air for days or weeks, and is small enough to invade the lung airways.

Five tonnes of used cooking oil to power vehicles of Tamil Nadu govt,"CHENNAI: The oil that's used to fry your evening fritters in that eatery nearby might soon power government vehicles including public buses, food safety officials have said.The food safety wing has collected five tonne of used cooking oil from various hotels and eateries over 15 days between August 16 and September 1 as part of a national campaign to repurpose used cooking oil.The used oil - toxic to health and hazardous to the environment -will be converted into more than 4,500 litres of biodiesel that will be used along with diesel in government vehicles including cars, vans and public buses.""It is a small beginning,"" said designated food safety officer (Chennai) Dr P Satheesh Kumar. ""The aim is to stop resale of cooking oil from big food and beverage operators to smaller units. It will prevent heart diseases and cancer among consumers, stop soil and water pollution as it will be disposed of in a secure pathway, reduce air pollution due to vehicular emissions and bring down diesel cost for the government,"" he said.The city is estimated to generate up to 500 tonne of used oil every month, which can produce up to 4.2lakh litres of biodiesel. /In festive months, the collections can increase up to 600 tonnes, said B Chandrasekar, who has been appointed as an aggregator for re-used oil for the city.His team collects re-used oil from food and beverage operators at periodic intervals. The team pays up to ??34 per litre of used oil, which is then handed over to biodiesel manufacturers. At least 85% of the volume is retained when the used oil is converted into biodiesel.Chandrasekar's team has started collection of used cooking oil in Tiruvallur. They collected 5 tonnes of oil in March, 3 tonnes in April and 300kg in May due to increase in Covid-19 cases. But in June, his team collected six tonnes, which increased to 13 tonnes in July and 19 tonnes in August.Over the next six months, the food safety wing aims to increase collection of reused oil to at least 100 tonnes a month.

"In a first, traffic police to launch anti-pollution drive","Kolkata: The traffic police on Wednesday asked traffic guards to conduct pollution tests on vehicles at random, especially since there has been an explosion of private cars and bikes on the roads to avoid jostling on public transport in Covid times. The task to keep a check on toxic fumes from vehicles was so far restricted to the anti-pollution cell of Lalbazar but Kolkata Traffic Police decided to step in for the first time. A Lalbazar source said the drive is being launched following complaints from environmentalists, who pointed out that several vehicles claimed to have pollution certificates but were flouting the norms and wreaking havoc on the environment. /The smoke meters that 20 of the 25 traffic guards had bought almost two years ago and had been lying idle will finally come to use, probably from Wednesday. ""We decided to train our men in using the devices. We took help of Pollution Control Board officials and also,  sent the equipment for servicing. The few guards-Garia, Southwest, Bhowanipore and Metiabruz-which do not have the devices will procure them, too,"" said a Lalbazar officer. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha confirmed that an instruction had been passed to ensure the drive started  from Wednesday. ""Several guards have already carrying out checks and the others will follow suit. The force should be concerned about the environment, especially when there has been a boom of private four-wheelers and two-wheelers. We want to ensure these checks are carried out extensively,"" said Sinha.Environment activists, like Subhas Datta and S M Ghosh, welcomed the move, saying there was no point arguing over jurisdiction. They agreed on the fact when the transport department lacked enough manpower, allowing highly polluting vehicles to go scot free, some police action to curb pollution was always necessary. Police also pointed out that since their personnel, who were constantly out on roads, inhaled the toxic fumes, they were ready to control it.  ""The traffic guards undertake a number of drives, they can carry out this additional responsibility,"" said an officer. In a bid to ensure a clean environment, Kolkata Police had planned to set up a database of drivers in the city to ensure they procured their Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificates on time. The police also have two other proposals to check rising air pollution: First, they may not allow renewal of PUC certificates if traffic challans are pending and secondly, efforts are on to centrally preserve  the PUC certificates of all trucks entering the city. ""Many PUC certificates, especially those issued to trucks outside Kolkata, have turned out to be fake. In some cases, the carbon deposit tests are carried out with accelerators pressed at 60-70 km/hr, though the standard is 90 km/hr,"" said an officer. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
HC asks govt to reply on coal-to-gas shift,"Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Friday directed the state authorities to file appropriate reply in response to a PIL seeking reduction of air pollution by ensuring that industrial units operating with the use of coal should be shifted to natural gas.The PIL was filed by petitioner-advocate Amit Panchal citing high air pollution levels due to emissions from industrial units across the state and showing how Gujarat's cities fare badly on environment front. He has sought HC directions to the authorities to ""fix emission standards and parameters for industries so that pollution levels in the state are maintained within acceptable limits"".The petitioner has also urged the court to ask the government to ensure that ""all industries/plants/sites be allowed to function only if they are operated on natural gas and not with the use of coal"". The demand is to identify and discontinue all polluting industrial units and to make alternative arrangements to immediately seize and stop using coal and to provide natural gas as fuel to the said industries to prevent and control air pollution.The petitioner has contended that burning of coal leads to emission of various pollutants in the form of gaseous as well as particulate matter. Air pollution across towns and cities in Gujarat is higher than permissible limits. /Hence, there is an urgent need to identify units causing large-scale pollution. He has asserted that it is government's duty to secure the right to life by providing a healthy environment. Sections 17 of The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 confers powers on the government to take preventive steps to curb air pollution. It can close, prohibit or regulate any industry, operation or process.The petitioner submitted that air pollution is a major global public health risk. A 2016 WHO study estimated 4.2 million deaths per year due to various diseases on account of high pollution. He cited the Central Pollution Control Board's report which categorised Vadodara, Ankleshwar, Vapi and Bhavnagar as having 'critically polluted' air. Four other regions - Vatva, Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Morbi are identified as being 'severely polluted'. Moreover, Ahmedabad, Surat and Vadodara find a place in the list of 122 'Non-Attainment Cities' categorized by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change.

"Mumbai: Combined impact of climate, agriculture and air pollution leading to heart, lung and nutrition-related diseases: Study","MUMBAI: A new research has established interconnections between climate, air quality and agriculture and their combined impact on public health. The paper titled, 'A systems lens to evaluate the compound human health impacts of anthropogenic activities', published in the journal 'One Earth' on Monday, categorises health impacts into heat-related illnesses (such as exhaustion, heat strokes, and cardiovascular events), pollution-related illnesses (such as asthma, enhanced risk of lung cancer, chronic pulmonary diseases), and nutrition-related illnesses (such as anaemia in women of reproductive age, iron and zinc deficiency). This interaction between climate, agriculture, and air quality to specific health impacts creates a composite picture of the effects on public health due to anthropogenic (human-induced) environmental changes. The study calls for the attention of policymakers to consider these diverse and dynamic inter-linkages and approach to public health through a comprehensive scientific lens. /Using examples from India, the scientists have emphasised the need for better tools and local, high-resolution data on health, weather, emissions, air pollution, and land use to evaluate human and environmental impacts on public health. Prof Ashwini Chhatre, Associate Professor, Public Policy, Indian School of Business, who led the research in South Asia said, ""Agricultural practices impact air quality, but air quality also impacts agriculture, all amplified by the human-induced climate effect."" Along with ISB, researchers from Columbia University, University of Washington, Boston University, and the University of Delaware have collaborated on this multidisciplinary research. India, the research says, is one of the most vulnerable regions to environment-related health hazards, owing to its high population density, high poverty rates, severe food insecurity, and over-reliance on agriculture.

'Need to work close to home so city can breathe',"On World Car Free Day today, Dr Ravindra Khaiwal, additional professor, environment health, School of Public Health and department of Community Medicine, PGI, speaks to Shimona Kanwar about ways to keep the environment clean with traffic modifications.Road traffic need not necessarily lead to pollution, says Ravindra Khaiwal, discussing ways of going car-free.Why celebrate car-free day at all?This day is celebrated to create awareness about clean and green modes of transport which encourages people to cycle or walk to work.Why is car-free day important?We know that emission from the transport sector in cities is majorly responsible for increased air pollution and noise pollution levels. /Air pollution is one of the leading causes of premature mortality and morbidity, leading to over 7 million deaths globally. Noise pollution is linked with an increased risk of hypertension and many non-communicable diseases.How will it benefit cities?We need to plan and develop cities in a way that people work closer to home, including markets and schools. This will help cities breathe and reduce traffic on the road. We know that traffic congestion enhances exposure to air pollution.Do you have any suggestions for the city planner?Smart cities should include clean and green transportation components, like the electric public transport being planned by City Beautiful. The connectivity should be to the last miles and flexible. The bike route should be extended to rural areas of cities where majority of users live. The road should have spaces to walk or pedal and their safety should be the top priority.What is your say on the Smart Bike project?We must appreciate the Chandigarh administration's effort to initiate the smart bike project. The city is focusing on extension, maintenance and safety of cycle routes. One can use this while limiting pollution emissions. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Making the invisible visible',"As a data scientist and a father, I have always wondered why there isn't enough data-backed proof for so many health problems children and adults suffer due to environmental factors such as air pollution, pollen, water contamination and greenhouse gases.Medical practices rely too much on reactive medicines and antibiotics when 8 out of 10 diseases can be attributed to environmental factors.Though it's commonly known that 'prevention is cure', this is not put into practice due to lack of easily accessible environmental data. In the case of air pollution, we continue to breathe polluted air simply because pollution is often not visible to the naked eye. I would like to see technology that would help individuals 'see' environmental factors, just as how we see traffic or weather. They should be able to see emissions, air quality, carbon footprint and other factors that can help them make informed decisions to stay healthier and also reduce the environmental impact of their actions.

Zila and gram panchayats to operate farm machinery banks now: UP govt,"Lucknow: Nearly a week after withdrawing 868 cases filed against farmers for stubble burning, the UP government has decided to give the responsibility of operating farm machinery banks for crop residue management to zila and gram panchayats.Stubble burning leaves plumes of smoke causing air pollution and endangers health of millions of people.The rural bodies will shoulder the responsibility in districts where cooperative, cane and industrial societies have expressed inability in purchasing the equipment.The agriculture department has issued the directions citing the recent Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal (NGT) orders asking state government to ensure setting up of farm machinery banks in rural areas. Additional chief secretary (agriculture) Devesh Chaturvedi told TOI that the measure would mainly help the marginal farmers who will be able to get farm equipments at a reasonable price. The move comes ahead of winters when air pollution in Delhi, NCR and neighbouring states like Punjab, Haryana and UP assumes grim proportions ostensibly due to stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and UP. /In February, the Supreme Court had asked the Centre to file an affidavit with details of steps taken to curb stubble burning.The SC was hearing a petition which said that the issue of air pollution because of stubble burning would again come to the fore in winters. Agriculture department officials said the state government has mandated setting up of farm machinery banks with funding up to Rs 5 lakh.Sources, however, said that some cooperative and cane societies expressed their inability to operate farm machinery banks, compelling the state government to rope in zila and gram panchayats for the task.The issue of air pollution due to rampant burning of crop residue has been bothering the state government for the past few years. In fact, the idea of setting up machinery bank was conceptualised by the UP government in August 2020 - provisioning a grant of 80% of the total amount required for setting up a farm equipment bank. In the case of individual farmers, the grant was restricted to 50%.Under the arrangement, a committee headed by the respective magistrate would select the cooperative /cane societies/gram panchayats which would inform the agricultural directorate about the requirements. The directorate would then transfer the grant of Rs 4 lakh to societies.The cases of stubble burning are largely registered in the west UP region. In 2019, the state government had constituted a cell in every district to keep an eye on stubble burning. The revenue department had also roped in gram pradhans and lekhpals to curb burning of crop residue. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"New WHO air quality guidelines beneficial in long term, says PGI-Chandigarh professor","CHANDIGARH: The new WHO air quality (AQ) guidelines revised after 13 years that were released on Wednesday were significant and will be beneficial in the long term, according to Ravindra Khaiwal, additional professor, environment health, School of Public Health, and department of community medicine, PGI.The new guidelines mention that the long term exposure to particulate matter which was acceptable at annual mean concentration of PM2.5 in ambient air from 10 ?g/m3 has been reduced to 5 ?g/m3. These recommendations are stricter. ""It will bring focus on strict and swift action for better air quality. India is going to review ambient air quality standards next year and we are sure that will put more emphasis on National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) to timely achieve its goal,"" said Khaiwal.""Along with 128 cities, Chandigarh was listed among non-attainment cities and received a grant under NCAP to mitigate the air pollution levels,"" said Khaiwal.The new guidelines mentioned that poor air quality is an important risk factor for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Vulnerable populations, including people with underlying medical conditions, are likely to have a greater risk of complications associated with Covid infection. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Hyd air like smoking 2 cigarettes a day,"Hyderabad: Metaphorically, every Hyderabadi smoked at least 1.75 cigarettes a day all through the last one year. At least that's what the latest PM 2.5 levels of the city indicate, if physicists Richard Muller and daughter Elizabeth Muller's 2015 method of measuring air pollution is considered. /Through extensive research, these scientists from Berkeley Earth concluded that a day's exposure to 22 mg cubic per metre of PM 2.5 - tiny particulate matter created through emissions from industries, burning fuels, fine heavy metals etc - is equivalent to smoking one cigarette.""The high concentration of PM 2.5 is equivalent to even kids smoking two cigarettes and that can cause serious pulmonary complications. Early episodes of asthma, bronchitis and chronic inflammatory lung diseases are among few of those. In the long run, the lung capacity can be reduced, resulting in severe damage,"" said Dr Viswesvaran Balasubramanian, senior interventional pulmonologist and sleep medicine specialist at Yashoda Hospitals, Malakpet.Doctors said that increased exposure to PM 2.5 levels may lead to cardiovascular and respiratory issues as PM 2.5 not only gets into the lungs but also enters the blood streams.""We are observing a rise in interstitial lung diseases among people over the past few years. This usually triggers following excessive exposure to hazardous pollutants. Not just this, people are becoming more and more allergic resulting in further health issue. With the pollution levels rising, the only solution is to be vigilant of symptoms for an early treatment,"" said Dr A Raghukanth, senior consultant pulmonologist, Medicover Hospitals.

Karnataka: Three injured as boiler inside chemical factory in Anekal explodes,"BENGALURU: Three workers sustained injuries when a boiler exploded inside a chemical factory in Karnataka's Attibele Industrial Area on the southeastern fringes of Bengaluru on Friday afternoon.Four others standing at a shop opposite to the factory complained of breathlessness as thick smoke billowed out of the explosion site and were rushed to the hospital and provided first aid.The explosion took place around 1.20 pm at the chemical factory Vaddarapalya in the Attibele Indusrial Area, Anekal taluk, which is around 30 km from the city centre. Locals staged a flash demonstration in front of the unit, alleging that the air pollution caused by the factory is forcing them to breathe toxic air.""Of the three factory workers injured in the blast, one has sustained serious injuries,"" Superintendent of Police, Bengaluru Rural, Kona Vamsi Krishna said.While M Suryanath, 27, and V Munegowda, 30, sustained minor burns and breathing issues, B Jnanavelu, 22, suffered burns on both his hands, right shoulder and waist.According to Fire and Emergency Services officials, three fire tenders were pressed into service.""A total of 97 employees were present inside the factory when the blast took place and all of them moved out to safety. The seriously injured worker has been shifted to a private hospital while others are being treated at Anekal government hospital,"" a Fire and Emergency Services official said.Asked for the reason behind the explosion, the official said, ""Most likely, it could be a short circuit related explosion. /If not, a technical snag in the boiler could have triggered the explosion.""According to the police, the factory supplies materials to pharma industries.Local residents gathered outside the factory and held a protest, shouting slogans against the factory management. ""Every day, we are forced to breathe air laced with chemicals and it is affecting our health,"" they said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Now, nameplates on chimneys will help identify polluting Ghaziabad factories","Ghaziabad: With winter approaching, the district pollution control board has come up with a unique way to check air pollution in the industrial areas of Ghaziabad. The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has, in fact, asked all industrial units, particularly those in Sahibabad, to put an embossed nameplate on the chimneys of their factories so that polluting industries could be easily identified and penalised.Officials said that residents living in the vicinity of industrial areas have in the past posted pictures of chimneys emitting visible black smoke but in many cases, the factory concerned could not be identified. However, with this new initiative, the erring factories could be forthwith identified, they said.""There are about 350 polluting industries across 11 industrial zones of Ghaziabad, many of which are in the vicinity of residential areas like the one in Sahibabad. /We have directed all industries to put a nameplate on their chimneys,"" said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UPPCB. ""This has been done because we often face problems in identifying the polluting units even after receiving complaints along with photos.""The industries have been directed to comply with the UPPCB order by September 30. ""We will start the inspection of industries from the first week of October and action will be taken against those who fail to comply with the same,"" said Sharma.In a related development, the Ghaziabad district magistrate convened a meeting of all stakeholders on September 20 against the backdrop of the National Green Tribunal's (NGT) order to check pollution in Kaushambi township in the wake of a plea filed by the local residents' body, KARWA.Vinay Kumar Mittal, president of KARWA, told TOI, ""There is a case pending in the NGT and the Supreme Court over the issue of pollution in Kaushambi township. In August this year, the NGT directed the Meerut divisional commissioner to hold a meeting of all stakeholders to take cognizance of unattended work and the meeting that took place on September 20 was convened in accordance with the green tribunal's order.""""It was decided at the meeting that the traffic management plan prepared for Kaushambi township on the orders of the SC would be implemented,"" he added.

"Do you really need air purifiers: Importance, functionality, options","Respiratory diseases and even cancer have been linked to air pollution for a long time. A recent study has found that there are more terrible consequences when the air quality drops -- including depression, anxiety, increased rates of suicide, and an overall increase in the risk of mental disorders, especially among children.An air purifier is one option and is readily available to most people. Let's talk about how an air purifier works and are they effective at improving the local air quality.How does an Air Purifier workAir purifiers work properly in a closed system. At the room's entry point, air purifiers use fans to suck in the outside air. /Then, this air is filtered and pushed out as clean air. From this follows that filters are critical components in ensuring air purifier efficacy.Air purifier filters can be made out of -- paper, fibreglass, fibre and mesh. Good ones have multiple filter layers that have to be replaced regularly to remain effective. For larger particles, air filters are usually reusable, only required to be meticulously washed. These pollutants can range from pollen to dust mites. Such air purifiers are the most common, but you can't rely on them to remove smaller air impurities.Importance of air purifiersA study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry tracked 13,000 participants in London, UK, and found that reducing the volume of small particle pollution by even a few percentage points would make a huge difference to mental health and save tens of millions in sunk healthcare costs each year.For this, you need cleaner air and you can't always rely on the government and businesses to use cleaner vehicles or implement other clean air initiatives. But at your home, you can always use an air purifier. Here are the types of air purifiers that are available in the marketUV based air purifiers If you want an air purifier that kills airborne bacteria or mold, it should have a fan and a filter mesh for large pollutants. Such air purifiers use UV (ultraviolet light) filters. An active air purifier uses higher wattage to expose air to ultraviolet rays constantly.Some of these air purifiers claim to kill COVID-19 virus particles, including the variants. They are most commonly marketed with the UV-C feature-short-wave ultraviolet light. In some markets, these active air purifiers will also be marketed as UVGI, standing for ultraviolet germicidal irradiation.Many of us suffer from radiation burns when exposed to the sun during the summer. This is because the sun emits a type of UV light. When your skin is exposed to it, it reddens, signifying inflammation. In other words, your skin cell DNA suffers damage when it is bombarded with UV radiation.Regardless if a virus is RNA or DNA-based, it suffers the same damage. This is also the reason why flu seasons retreat during summer and intensify during autumn/winter. Both viruses and bacteria are single-cell organisms, relying on the integrity of their DNA to survive and reproduce quickly. Therefore, UV-C air purifiers effectively mimic the sun in enclosed spaces. Acting as lamps, these germicidal air purifiers can either have mercury, phosphor, or quartz-based UV light emitters. Accordingly, they can either give out a bluish hue or be completely invisible to the human eye. Currently, it's recommended for residential areas to use UV-C air purifiers at a 254nm wavelength.Drawbacks of UV Air PurifiersUV-based air purifiers require longer exposure to complete its germicidal removal. This means that they lose effectiveness if there is high airflow coming into the enclosed space. Furthermore, they can also break down oxygen molecules in addition to viruses and bacteria.Breaking down of oxygen molecules can cause negative health effects. To avoid this, manufacturers have started using a special coating to further fine-tune the wavelength. Moreover, while it does eliminate some types of mold and bacteria, it doesn't work well on mold and bacterial spores. Such spores require heightened UV radiation and prolonged exposure. Usually, residential-grade air purifiers are not strong enough to do the job. Lastly, UV-C air purifiers don't affect organic particles coming from VOCs (volatile organic compounds) like chemical fumes (from paint and varnish), smoke, pet dander, allergens and other pollution-related compounds.Here are some names and prices of UV light-based air purifiers that are available in India:/<a href=""https://www.amazon.in/Cello-Purifier-Light-Watts-White/dp/B08CBPV6TX"">Cello Air Purifier: Rs 2,499</a>/ /<a href=""https://www.amazon.in/CHECKNSURE-Air-Alpha-Purifier-Sterilizer/dp/B08R7PGPHJ"">CHECKNSURE Air Alpha Room Air Purifier: Rs 5,999</a>/ /<a href=""https://www.amazon.in/Carrier-AP2006UV-Ultraviolet-AP2006-UV/dp/B08NPZ4GDT"">Carrier Airone AP2006UV: Rs 13,117</a>/ /<a href=""https://www.amazon.in/Yuvi-Safe-Disinfectent-Sterilizer-technology/dp/B09CLDS3GK"">Yuvi Safe - UVC Air Disinfectent: Rs 5,500</a>/HEPA air filtration systemA UV-C air purifier will be enough if you live in a sparsely populated area free of air pollution but it will not kill the viruses. On the other hand, if you seek a more universal and comprehensive solution, an air purifier should also deal with VOCs. In fact, to their volatility, ultraviolet rays may worsen it by transforming them into more toxic compounds.To increase effectiveness, a High-Efficiency Particulate Arrestance (HEPA) air filtration system is the way to go. Also referred to as ""true HEPA filters,"" they are the go-to solution for people who suffer from allergies. The best models usually have multi-filtration systems.Here are some names and prices of HEPA based air purifiers that are available in India:/<a href=""https://www.amazon.in/Coway-Professional-Purifier-Anti-Virus-AP-1019C/dp/B08GJ57MKL"">Coway Professional Air Purifier: Rs 13,500</a>/ /<a href=""https://www.amazon.in/Sharp-Purifier-FP-F40E-W-Filter-Cluster/dp/B01B0DT29A"">Sharp Air Purifier: Rs 10,990</a>/ /<a href=""https://www.amazon.in/Mi-Purifier-Filter-Smart-Connectivity/dp/B0811VCGL5"">Mi Air Purifier 3</a>/ /<a href=""https://www.amazon.in/Eureka-Forbes-Aeroguard-Purifier-Filtration/dp/B08GYTPFB4"">Eureka Forbes Aeroguard AP 700EX</a>/PECO Air PurifiersHowever, on the state-of-the-art technology front, PECO (photoelectrochemical oxidation) air purifiers are becoming more popular.Standing apart from both HEPA and UV-C methods, PECOs not only destroy allergens, VOCs, viruses, and resistant bacterial strains, but they also don't produce ozone as a side effect. In addition, PECO air purification tech can remove particles as small as 0.1 nm, 1000x smaller than most HEPA filters allow.Here are some names and prices of PECO based air purifiers that are available in India:/<a href=""https://www.amazon.in/Philips-AC1215-20-Purifier-White/dp/B01L6MT7E0"">Philips AC1215/20 Air purifier: Rs 11,099</a>/ /<a href=""https://www.amazon.in/Molekule-Air-Mini-Filtration-Technology/dp/B07ZPLXB54"">Molekule Air Mini - Air Purifier: Rs 31,999</a>/Do you really need it?If you ever wonder if air purifiers are a waste of money, they are most certainly not.

'Cut 40% air pollution in city to meet NCAP goal',"Lucknow: To be able to achieve goals set under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), Lucknow needs to cut its current pollution level by about 40%.This would require a multi-pronged strategy that addresses challenges like reducing vehicular pollution, checking dust and reducing smog, monitoring activities of the industry and brick kiln and improving public transport. The facts came to fore at a round table on 'Air Pollution: Facts to Act', organised by a consortium of social organisations led by Lung Care Foundation here on Wednesday. Setting the context for the initiative, Dr Arvind Kumar, founder trustee said: ""Air Pollution is a silent killer. /In polluted countries, there are no non-smokers as air pollution impacts the lung the way second hand smoke does. It affects every organ in our body, including asthma, COPD, stroke and diabetes. The problem is as much related to unborn children as adults and children and cannot be ignored.""Retired IPS officer AP Maheshwari, who brought stakeholders on a common platform said: ""There is no force equivalent to that of a civil society movement and cooperation. Unless the members of civil society take a firm resolution, no amount of efforts of various stakeholders can bring about success."" Calling for concerted action, founder trustee Rajiv Khurana said: ""the consortium aims to evolve a stronger public private partnership, jointly understand the issues and undertake the solutions for the common good of the public for clean air and health."" Sectoral experts and academicians spoke at length on the various facets of the issue to chalk out a plan for policy makers.

Clear waste sites before winter: Pollution board,"Noida/Ghaziabad: The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has written to the Noida Authority, Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) and other agencies to prepare a list of sites where municipal solid waste, horticulture and construction and demolition (C&D) waste is being discarded and have it cleared at the earliest before the onset of winters.The letter, sent on Wednesday, said air quality in Noida remains between 'poor' and 'severe' during winter months. One of the major sources of pollution is smoke from the burning of waste, which can be controlled if garbage is not dumped illegally, said officials.""Stubble burning is also another reason for pollution across NCR. However, most of the local farmers are able to reuse their stubble. /But if waste is lying on the roads, people burn it to keep themselves warm in the cold, adding to pollution,"" said a UPPCB official.Officials said the sites are expected to be cleaned up by October 15, the day the graded response action plan (GRAP) comes into effect. The pollution department will also ask authorities to finish repair and maintenance work along roads and other sites where dust is collected. ""There are complaints from residents that construction material is lying around on roads and some stretches need repairs. We have written to Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation and Noida Authority to complete these works latest by the end of October,"" said Utsav Sharma, regional officer for Noida and Ghaziabad. He added that the deadline for such repairs is usually earlier, but the work could take more time this year because of the extended monsoon.In Ghaziabad, polluting industries have been sent notices to get their systems and filters repaired. There are about 350 such industries in the city. Most industries that were asked to display their names on chimneys have complied, according to officials.UPPCB officials said residents are also being asked to submit complaints related to air pollution so that these can be resolved by October.

"Control dust, snarls at expressway repair sites: UPPCB to Noida","Noida: The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has sent a notice reminding the Noida Authority about taking adequate dust-control measures at places on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway that are under repairs. It has also asked the Authority to ensure that the repair work does not become a hurdle to smooth movement of traffic.The UPPCB notice follows repeated complaints from residents of nearby sectors that contractor hired by the Authority to repair the road neither keeps the construction material covered nor sprinkles water on the stretch to help the dust settle.""The repair work will take its own time. But the contractor has to ensure minimum air pollution during the process. /We have asked the Authority to regularly sprinkle water on the stretch, which is not being done as of now,"" said Utsav Sharma, the regional officer of UPPCB.Sharma said that another cause for concern was traffic jams caused by the repair work. He pointed out that vehicles stranded at one place also added to pollution. ""For road projects that go on for a longer period, traffic should be diverted or regulated in a way that vehicles don't keep waiting. This needs to be ensured along the expressway,"" Sharma said. Officials said dust pollution was intense around the stretch between Mahamaya flyover and Phase 2 on the Noida to Greater Noida route. Three underpasses are also being constructed on the expressway, which is adding to pollution in the absence of proper preventive measures, officials said. Noida Authority officials claimed all dust control measures were being taken at the repair sites. They said the contractor would be reminded to ensure more water sprinkling. With winter approaching, the pollution control department is working on an action plan and alerting authorities to take dust control measures by the middle of this month, when the air quality usually started deteriorating. Through most of August and September, the AQI had remained in the 'good' and 'moderate' categories, thanks to the extended monsoon. On Monday, however, the AQI was at 94 (satisfactory) in Noida and 128 (moderate) in Greater Noida.Earlier this week, UPPCB had written to the Noida Authority, Ghaziabad Development Authority and other agencies to prepare a list of sites where municipal solid waste, horticulture and construction and demolition (C&D) waste was being discarded. The authorities were asked to clear the sites cleared at the earliest. One of the major sources of local air pollution, the letter said, was smoke from the burning of waste in the open. This could be controlled by putting a stop to unauthorised dumping of garbage, it added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Last week TOI asked its readers if they think the government is doing enough to protect Hyderabad's green cover. Here are some of the responses....,"A couple of months ago a tree was being chopped, in my neighbourhood, as it was hindering the expansion plan of a builder. We stopped the cutting and lodged a complaint with the Tree Protection Department, associated with the forest department. They came right away and checked, asked the builder to pay a fine of Rs 3800 (as he had not taken earlier permission) and gave him the clearance to continue chopping the tree. The builder happily paid the amount and carried on with the felling. /What does this mean? It means that officials are no longer interested in protecting and preserving trees but want to turn it into a revenue generating scheme. If this continues, how do you think we are going to protect the rest of the trees (very few anyway) left behind? -- Vanita Khatter The government is not doing enough to protect Hyderabad's tree cover. Tree felling is happening not only in my neighbourhood but everywhere in the city. Look at the road widening works going on. Are the trees that are being felled for it, being relocated? Look at all the other constructions (flyovers, buildings etc) that are happening. How many trees are being felled to make way for them? Flyovers are now more important than parks for the government. Whatever little green cover is being protected, is being done by responsible citizens and conscious societies. It's time the government stepped up too to do its bit. -- Nagarjuna S Rao Y A few days ago, I read an article in TOI about Hyderabad pollution that said that the air (oxygen) which we inhale is equal to smoking two cigarettes a day. This means we are all smokers and one day we'll suffer from it. During the pandemic, people spent thousands of rupees on oxygen cylinders. People should understand how trees are helpful to us and grow as many trees as possible. -- Suman Vikram The drastic drop in green cover, owing to infrastructure work underway in the city, is a serious concern. While the government has taken up initiatives to compensate for this loss and tackle air pollution, the alacrity and pace of planting saplings, after the initial enthusiasm, has sadly reduced. It is important that the government take tougher measures to safeguard old and big trees while continuing the process of planting more saplings, in order to increase the green cover of the city. -- Srinivasan Ramaswamy The GHMC is planting trees on a massive scale. But at the same time, it should involve the local community to protect these plants and water them till they are fully grown. The GHMC should also give incentives to house owners for planting trees by reducing property tax according to the number of trees they plant. At the same time the GHMC should give priority to developmental activities where there is more greenery. The government should also insist that all new high rises are given permission only if they assure to take up vertical and horizontal gardening. These steps will bring down temperatures and reduce pollution levels particularly along the IT corridor. -- Kanchiraju Kasinath For years now the Telangana government has been spending close to Rs 500 to 1,000 crore every year in the name of Haritha Haram, to make Hyderabad a green city. Yet, it has failed to make much difference. To address this our government must allot two-three members from every colony to maintain the saplings that are planted. This can also help in providing employment for the youth. The government can also ask ward corporators to survey houses in their wards and reward those who maintain a good green cover. This will encourage more people to take up plantations. -- Ajay K  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air quality worsens in MP after lifting of Covid curbs,"BHOPAL: Curfew and lockdown induced by Corona helped not only to break the Covid chain of infection, but also improving the air quality. /<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/Close to 50 days of lockdown between April and June this year, had resulted in substantial reduction in air pollution in major cities of Madhya Pradesh. However, air pollution went up again after lifting of restrictions. /Poor rainfall in some parts of the state and dust due to damaged roads in major cities of MP attributed to the rise in air pollution.Air quality index of Bhopal on May 30 was 77 while it was measured at 107 on Friday. In Gwalior, AQI was 53 on May 30 which has increased to 127 and in Jabalpur, the AQI was 80 on May 30 and by and large remained the same at 83 on Friday.The AQI of Bhopal and Gwalior was above 100. It is moderate and may lead to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, the increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage, among others.PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases.Officials said, dust gets heavy in rain and settle down as it cannot fly in the air. The vehicular pollution also gets down as in wet roads tyres cannot send dust flying high. It is the reason why pollution levels come down during rains.According to experts and pollution control board norms, air quality index between 0 and 50 is termed as good with minimal possible health impacts while air quality between 51 and 100 is satisfactory but may lead to minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people. Air quality above 100 is moderate and leads to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. AQI above 200 leads to breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"'Festive rush, drop in night temp spike air pollution before Diwali'","Lucknow: Festive rush together with a slight drop in the night temperatures have impacted the city's clean air causing a spike in air pollution levels by over 100 units in the past one week.The state capital was under the 'satisfactory' air quality category in the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) list at the beginning of the month.However, it now figures in the 'moderate' air quality category. The exposure to such air leads to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases, warn experts.The analysis of Lucknow's Air Quality Index (AQI) data released daily by CPCB indicates an increasing trend in the city's air pollution level. While the city's AQI was 71 on October 1, on Thursday an AQI of 156 was recorded.From October 1-7, the city's air pollution levels ranged between 71 and 156 with October 3 recording an AQI of 55 (lowest pollution levels witnessed in October).Thereafter, the air pollution increased falling in a range of 130-175, with October 10 recording a highest of 175. According to Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre of Science and Environment, New Delhi, the change in weather conditions and local factors has led to this spike. /""Every year around this time from October onwards winter pollution begins to build up. One of the key reasons behind it is the atmospheric changes. As winter sets in, we experience something called 'temperature inversion condition' in which due to falling temperatures, air cannot rise high to disperse and as a result it gets trapped and so do the pollutants,"" she said.Environmentalist Venkatesh Dutta attributed traffic jams due to the festive rush to the hike in pollution level.He said, ""Traffic snarls because of people venturing out for festivals are the main reason behind the spike in air pollution levels. People should use the metro and public transport more to save air quality from deteriorating."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Gurgaon chokes on dust from its own infra sites,"Gurgaon: The pollution control board in Haryana recently announced a dust portal that will get live data from sensors that are to be installed to monitor construction sites. One doesn't, however, need sensors to see what's wrong - non-compliance with dust mitigating measures is evident from a visit to the sites, both of private and government projects. Most construction and infrastructural projects in Gurgaon don't follow basic guidelines of the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change, including shuttering the construction area with green sheets, sprinkling water and covering vehicles carrying construction and demolition (C&D) waste. As a result, their immediate vicinity has turned into dust bowls. /For large projects like the Sohna elevated road and the Dwarka Expressway, the affected area too is much larger. A permanent haze shrouds the city's new sectors, which have the most construction sites. The graded response action plan (GRAP) was supposed to come into effect on Friday, but hasn't been imposed so far as the government hasn't received any directions from the Commission for Air Quality Management. For the past couple of weeks, the city claimed to have put in pre-GRAP measures, but these glaring violations continue. As a result, Gurgaon's air quality index (AQI), which is currently 'moderate', is likely to slip into the 'poor' category soon.A visit by TOI to other major construction sites in the city as well on Friday, including Atul Kataria Chowk, Huda City Centre and Mahavir Chowk, revealed a similar picture. Everything was covered with a fine layer of dust - the buildings, the trees, the vehicles, and even the workers. None of the workers were seen wearing a dust mask.On Friday, the AQI was recorded at 195 (moderate), a spike compared to the previous day, when the AQI stood at 172. At three of the city's four air monitoring stations, air quality hovered between 'poor' and 'moderate' levels. While the AQI was 195 at Teri Gram and 164 at Gwalpahari (both moderate), it stood at 226 at Sector 51 (poor). The AQI was not monitored at Vikas Sadan because of insufficient data.In new sectors of Gurgaon, where a majority of buildings are still under construction, some residents claimed that they have never seen a clear skyline due to the pervading dust haze. Though there are numerous hoardings along the roads that promise ""peaceful living"", ""a luxurious life"" and ""green surroundings"" in highrises with all amenities, the reality is the opposite, they said.""We have all been covered in dust for more than two years now because of the Sohna elevated road project. No one cares about the health of residents. The civic authorities are only worried about the completion of the project, they hardly bother about anti-pollution norms,"" said Kanwar Pal, a resident of Sohna road.""Construction activities are going on at night in residential areas, which is also a violation of the norms. The sites don't have any covers to stop dust from dispersing,"" said Mona Singh, a resident of Sector 89.Under GRAP, strict vigilance by the civic authorities is required, as well as no tolerance for visible emissions, which should prevent plying of visibly polluting vehicles by impounding or heavy fines. The authorities should also enforce rules for dust control at construction sites and shut down those that are non-compliant. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) should periodically review compliance of the dust mitigation measures at C&D sites.Though the norms are very clear, most of the sites that TOI visited were found transporting construction material in trucks without adequate covering. The truck wheels were not washed, thus carrying dust outside of the premises. C&D waste was seen dumped along the roadsides and grinding of stones was being carried out in the open. The authorities, meanwhile, claimed they are taking measures to mitigate air pollution. ""We have been sprinkling water on roads where construction activities are being carried out. As it was noticed that dust was covering Mahavir Chowk, a team was sent to sprinkle water along the stretch,"" said Subhash Yadav, nodal officer of the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon's environment and sustainability wing. ""We are keeping a close watch on construction sites to mitigate air pollution. Our teams are taking the required action,"" HSPCB regional officer (Gurgaon) Sandeep Singh said. Asked when GRAP would be imposed in the city, HSPCB secretary S Narayana said: ""We will have a meeting on Monday with CAQM again to finalise the actions and directions on GRAP.""

Managing BP is crucial to prevent stroke: Dr Vijaya,"GUNTUR: Stating that one in four people suffer a stroke in their lifetime, noted neurologist and Indian Stroke Association (ISA) leader Dr P Vijaya said that managing blood pressure is very vital to prevent stroke. She said that air pollution and sedentary lifestyles were also leading to stroke among many people. /Addressing an awareness programme jointly organized by ISA and Rotary club of Guntur, Rotary club of Aadarsh, Rotary club of Guntur Vikas and Rotary club of Guntur Centennial on Sunday, Dr Vijaya, director of Lalitha Super Specialty hospitals group, observed that people should keep their hypertension and blood pressure levels under check to overcome the ill-effects of stroke. She said that keeping away from smoking and alcohol would immensely help prevent stroke. She said that people with heart diseases, high cholesterol levels and obesity should be very careful to safeguard themselves from falling victims to the stroke. ""Everyone can know about their risk through the Stroke Riskometer App, which is available in the play store. Take all possible measures to prevent stroke and take assistance from a doctor soon after getting doubt about a possible stroke,"" suggested Dr Vijaya. She said that the ISA has taken up aggressive campaign to help save lives. She said that they wanted to stop the first attack among people with risk factors through the campaign and second attack after a person suffers with TIA or stroke. ""Everyone more than 35 years should check their Blood Pressure levels and manage it to prevent stroke,"" said Dr.Vijaya. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Influx of cars for pandal visits hits Kolkata air quality,"KOLKATA: The sharp rise in use of personal vehicles during this year's pandal-hopping frenzy saw a spike in air pollution. Last year, when people were more restrained and there were fewer vehicles on the roads, the air quality was significantly better.This Ashtami and Navami (October 13 and 14), the PM2.5 concentration in the city's ambient air (75.3?g/m3 and 76.7?/g/m3 ) was more than six times higher compared to last Ashtami and Navami (October 23 and 24) with 12.5?g/m3 .PM2.5 is the tiniest and most dangerous of pollutants. Chemicals that ride piggyback on these particles play havoc with human lives. Particulate matter of size 2.5 or PM2.5 are ultrafine particles of diameter less than 2.5 micrometres, which is about 3% the diameter of a human hair, and can travel straight into the bloodstream.""Finer particulate matter like PM2.5 comes from automobile exhaust, smoke from chullahs at road-side eateries and restaurants, road dust and aerosol. Since Puja involves activities generating all such pollutants, the spike is quite inevitable,"" said a WBPCB scientist.""Unlike last year, revellers and pandal hoppers this year shed all pandemic inhibitions and moved from one pandal to another on two-wheelers and four-wheelers. Because of a sudden influx of a massive number of vehicles, there were snarls as well. Most of the motorists actually kept the car engine on even when it was static to keep the AC on. Thus, automobile fumes kept dirtying the ambient air,"" said Somendra Mohan Ghosh, an environmental activist.Even on October 7, the PM2.5 count was below 30?g/m3 . But from October 10, Panchami, Puja revellers hit the roads and the PM2.5 count suddenly rose to 55.8?g/m3 . From October 11, Shashthi, it rose further to 71.7?g/m3 . Since then, there has been no looking back. The smart shower on Dashami was a saving grace when the PM2.5 count marginally fell to 64.4?g/m3 .""What is worse is that this marks the beginning of the worst phase of the city's winter pollution. During Diwali, it reaches another peak - the point of no return. The dispersal of pollutants gradually gets lower because of meteorological changes and the city gradually becomes a gas chamber with a sudden spurt in health issues,"" said Deepanjan Majumdar, a scientist with National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) .

Celebrate but vaccinate: New mantra ahead of festivities this year,"Nagpur: With a very few number of Covid-19 cases and almost no deaths even after Ganesh Utsav and Navratri festivals, the pandemic is turning towards endemic in Vidarbha region. Markets, cinema halls and restaurants are opening up like pre-Covid conditions, making people enthusiastic about celebration of Diwali, the biggest festivity of the year.This has led the city health experts to come up with the next level of precautions for the common people ahead of the festival. They said vaccination is important, so ""celebrate, but vaccinate"".""I think, 1 % positivity rate in the population of 25 lakh is acceptable. /Ours is very less. So, instead of waiting for zero case which is impractical and impossible theory, we must move ahead now,"" said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. According to him, better idea is to find out unvaccinated pockets and target them to achieve at least 90% coverage.""Children under-10 years of age are largely safe. They are mixing up and playing together since almost two months but not many cases were detected. I think outdoor mingling has no problem at all,"" said paediatrician Dr Vijay Dhote, who is the president of Academy of Pediatrics (AOP), Nagpur. Physicians said that Covid-19 is no more deadly for healthy people. ""The cases coming in last two months are not manifesting any serious kind of disease. Patients require general care and they are recovering in home isolation. If your health parameters are fine and you have taken both doses of vaccines, there is no need to fear during festivities,"" said general physician Dr Mahesh Shah. Those who have pre-existing health complications must take additional care, said doctors. ""Having blood sugar, hypertension and other conditions can bring you to hospital in case you get infected with the virus. People with comorbidities must take vaccine. Elderly people also must complete their vaccine schedule at the earliest,"" said geriatric care specialist Dr Nilay Vishwakarma.Doctors have suggested people should wear masks and wash hands frequently, not due to Covid-19 fear but as a part of hygiene habits. ""Masks may protect from the air pollution that rises during Diwali. Washing hands saves us from many bacterial infections too,"" said paediatrician Namrata V.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"AQI poor again after 'good' break, spiking ozone levels a worry too","Gurgaon: In less than 48 hours, the city's air quality has nosedived to the ""poor"" category from ""good"" due to a combination of local emissions, meteorological factors and a high volume of particulate matter (PM). While fall in wind speed, from Tuesday's 11 km/hour to 6 km/hour today, and dip in temperature slowed down dispersion, experts say lack of effective clampdown on industrial emissions and vehicle exhaust gasses has further led to an accumulation of pollutants.On Wednesday, the city's Air Quality Index hovered at around 235 (poor) on a scale of 500, down from 81 (satisfactory) and 36 (good) recorded on October 19 and 18, respectively, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).An analysis of data obtained from the city's five air monitoring stations revealed that apart from PM 2.5 and PM 10, which are the most prominent contributors of pollution, there was a high presence of toxic pollutants like ozone, carbon monoxide (C0), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur oxide (SOx). Between October 1 and 20, three of five stations had unsafe levels of ozone.On October 15 and 16, the concentration of ozone touched 124 ug/m3 and 224ug/m3, respectively, at Vikas Sadan -- the highest concentration recorded in the city this month so far, as per CPCB data. /The Sector-51 station, meanwhile, recorded 160 ug/m3 and 203ug/m3 of ozone in the corresponding period, while at Manesar centre it touched 152ug/m3 and 170ug/m3 respectively on October 14 and 15.Experts have called the trend ""alarming"" as the prevalence of ground-level ozone indicates other pollutants, such as nitrogen oxide (NOx) and SOx, are also present in higher quantities. According to Aarti Khosla, director of Climate Trends, a climate research agency, a high presence of ozone in Gurgaon could be mainly linked with emissions from tailpipes. ""A lot of ozone pollution is caused due to vehicular emissions. Breathing the gas has a documented impact on lung health causing short-term breathing problems as well as dangerous conditions, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to long term exposure,"" Khosla told TOI. Devising a traffic plan that moves people and not vehicles, allowing space for public transportation to build up, she said, were some long-term measures that could be adopted to bring ozone level down in a city like Gurgaon. ""But let us not forget that ozone also comes from industrial sources like factories, chemical plants, power plants. Unless industrial emissions are not checked, it's hard to get rid of ozone. The gas can travel long distances as well so all ozone present in an area might not have been generated there, thereby compounding the effect of ozone,"" Khosla added. Currently, 266 industrial units are operational in Gurgaon. The sprawling city has nearly 1.1 million vehicles while more than 50,000 vehicles enter the city every day, according to the Regional Transport Office.According to experts, the concentration of ozone is directly proportional to NOx. ""The chemical reacts with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight to form ozone. So, the more the NOx, the more is the production of ozone. The major sources of CO2 and NOx are almost the same -- vehicular and industrial emissions,"" Shubhansh Tiwari, a research associate at Amity Centre for Air Pollution Control, said.On October 12, the Vikas Sadan centre recorded NO2 at 110g/m3, while it was at 125g/m3 on October 17. The permissible standard for both NO2 and sulphur dioxide (SO2) is 80.00g/m3. Garbage burning, experts said, was a dominant factor contributing to SO2, besides PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. Besides, rampant use of diesel generators across housing societies, hospitals, malls, hotels, offices and industrial units, also significantly add to PM and NOx emissions. Road dust and dust from construction sites, too, spike PM2.5 concentrations. ""Existing estimates on sources affecting Gurgaon's air quality indicate that vehicles, industries, dust and stubble burning are the leading sources of winter PM 2.5 levels in the city. With wind expected to predominantly blow from the northwest direction of NCR on October 20 and 21, stubble burning in neighbouring states, in addition to emissions from local sources, is likely to deteriorate air quality in the city. The state government should roll out pre-emptive measures to target deeper emission cuts,"" Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead at Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), told TOI. The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), meanwhile, recommended the government should take active steps to curb vehicular emissions, increase electric mobility, scale up public transport and pedestrian infrastructure, deploy citywide parking management to curb the use of private vehicles, and aggressively control industrial emissions. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), CSE, said, ""Implementation of these norms can only reduce pollution levels in the air. Though there are several factors that contribute to the pollution of air quality, dust from construction sites in the region is a major contributor.""Meanwhile, CPCB has implemented Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) measures under the ""moderate"" to ""poor"" range with immediate effect in National Capital Region (NCR) from October 18. On Wednesday, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) officials said that they were taking all required action to mitigate air pollution. ""Our staff is vigilant of local pollution such as road dust, dust from construction sites and garbage burning instances,"" Sandeep Singh, HSPCB regional officer, said.

580 villages from Kolhapur pledge not to burst crackers,"Kolhapur: Nearly half of this western Maharashtra district will have eco-friendly celebrations this Diwali largely due to the decision of 580 village panchayats not to burst firecrackers. Zilla Parishad chief executive officer Sanjaysinha Chavan had appealed to the village panchayats to pass resolutions against allowing villagers to use noisy and smoke generating firecrackers. This move, however, did not include any kind of incentive or awards to the village panchayats.Upon Chavan's appeal, 580 village panchayats passed the resolution and more villages are likely to join the movement to make skies free of pollution.""Several village panchayats are already celebrating firecrackers-free Diwali. /We had appealed to other village panchayats to follow it and over 580 have passed the resolution in their monthly meetings. The district has around 1,025 village panchayats. Many more grampanchayat's are likely to be added in the movement to celebrate Diwali cracker-free,"" he told TOI.Chavan said that since the decision has been taken voluntarily by the members of village panchayats, they will themselves implement and monitor it. Also, the village panchayats can organise several events showcasing the side effects of the use of firecrackers on human health as well as environment. ""We have extended all sorts support to the village panchayats. Many are already aware of the damage caused by the firecrackers. The villagers can make a difference this Diwali,"" said Chavan.Village panchayat members have to convince traders not to sell firecrackers in their jurisdiction, but they cannot ban them from selling. Similarly, the members have to convince the villagers not to burn firecrackers, but they cannot force them to do so by banning sale and buying firecrackers.Every year, the Diwali firecrackers in many parts of the state and country breach the permissible noise level limits. Air pollution levels on Diwali days is also higher than the safe norm at times. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Karnataka doctors' advice: Keep off smoke from firecrackers,"BENGALURU: Bursting crackers could prove dangerous in more ways than one for people who may have recovered but whose lungs have been weakened by Covid-19, and they must stay away from smoke emanating from fireworks, doctors have warned.Medical experts point out that many people had suffered a severe form of the disease during the second wave of Covid-19 infections and some are still suffering from long Covid. The 'keep-off smoke from fireworks' prescription is also for children and adults who have had upper respiratory infections and bronchitis in the past two months. Doctors say cracker smoke could worsen their condition.Dr KS Satish, president, Karnataka Pulmonologists' Association, said crackers, especially the colourful ones that give out more fumes and noise, must be avoided. /""This advice is not only for those who have recovered from Covid, but also those suffering from any form of respiratory illness,"" he said, adding that one should not get carried away just because Covid-19 cases have declined.Agreeing with him, Dr Ravindra Mehta, Bengaluru-based pulmonologist, said for those suffering from intrinsic lung diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the recommendation is to avoid pollutants.Dr Mehta said that as per studies conducted internationally, it was observed that the incidence of Covid rises with air pollution. ""Cities with a high air pollution index had a higher incidence of Covid,"" Dr Mehta said. ""This means all measures must be taken to reduce air pollution levels. Air pollution can irritate airways and cause respiratory symptoms. This can increase the patient's current distress and potentially delay recovery.""There are other respiratory viruses also in circulation which could spread if air pollution worsens. Dr Mehta said close to 20% of those who suffered from severe Covid during the second wave are still on follow up treatment. He said the average recovery time is three months to one year for those who suffered a severe form of the viral disease.Zero cracker norm is bestAfter ensuring smooth Dasara celebrations, the government had asked the state's Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee to draw up protocols to be followed for Deepavali. Dr MK Sudarshan, chairperson of the committee, says not bursting crackers is the best thing to do, a stand also advocated by the state pollution control board.However, while a total ban may not be feasible, the government is likely to allow only green crackers. The shell of a green cracker is much smaller, and it also has fewer pollutant raw materials while eliminating heavy metals such as chromium and cadmium. The composition of raw materials ensures less smoke.""People who have recovered from Covid and those with active infections must keep themselves away from fumes as their lung capacity would have been compromised,"" Dr Sudarshan said.Dr Mehta also pointed out that if someone shows respiratory symptoms, family members would fear that it is Covid and panic. ""It is better to avoid crackers and stay away from fumes,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Farm fires, waste burning may turn air 'poor'","Gurgaon: The city's air quality, which is in the 'moderate' category, is likely to worsen from Friday because of calm winds and factors like farm fires, garbage burning and dust from construction sites, according to the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) On Thursday, the air quality index (AQI) was recorded 182 (moderate), which was 168 on the previous day.  A pollution body official said crop burning, low temperature and slow wind coupled with increase in particulate matter will lead to a rise in the AQI by Friday. /""Dust is the primary cause of air pollution in our city.  Also, air quality is likely to turn poor from Friday if the weather condition is unfavourable,"" said Kuldeep Singh, regional official, HSPCB. An analysis done by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) reveals that over 7,300 and 1,796 farm fires were reported in Punjab and Haryana, respectively, between September 1 and October 27. The share of farm fires to Delhi's air pollution has remained 10-20% so far, says CEEW. ""With north-west winds being forecast over Delhi-NCR and if more farm fires happen in the next two days, smoke from farmlands coupled with emissions from local sources, declining temperatures and reducing wind speeds will worsen air quality in Delhi and surrounding areas,"" CEEW programme associate LS Kurinji said.

"Monitoring, green steps must to cut air pollution","The entire world realised its own redundancy in view of the Covid-19 onslaught. So many deaths occurred all across the world. However, what draws a bigger line today is air pollution and climate change.Deaths due to air pollution have sadly been far more than Covid-19 deaths.The causes aggravating this threat lie in the human zeal to constantly achieve higher economic growth, without considering its consequences. This has led to uncontrolled industrial pollution, vehicular emission, fossil fuel-based power generators, stubble burning, forest fires, defective urban architecture, inadequate solid waste management and shrinking green cover.Judged by the new WHO standards, we have 10 times more pollutants of various grades in India. /This is majorly due to our lifestyle. Indians already have 30% weaker lungs due to polluted air they breathe.The issue of clean air, therefore, must assume as much significance, if not more than 'roti', 'kapda' and 'makaan' (food, clothes and housing). Whatever policies or laws the government may legislate - and it has already done so with respect to vehicles, construction, industrial emissions, green cover, and agro waste management - it is amply clear that unless civic society makes it a movement, nothing much can be achieved.It is the power of civic society that has made smoking unacceptable in our drawing rooms and public places. For the sake of an awakening call, 51% pollution is emitted by our industries, 27% by vehicles, 17% by crop burning and 5% by fireworks. We can no longer afford to ignore this stark threat.Air pollution cannot be seen in isolation as 'everything hangs together'. Even the rising temperature sets off a vicious cycle. The whole ecosystem is getting affected in terms of the loss of micro-organisms, unpredictable weather, rising sea levels, attrition in water resources, and melting glaciers.Taking a holistic view, the world is now contemplating new and effective solutions. With rising population pressures, the impact is increasing. The constant pressure for growth is compelling the corporate sector to be expedient and use half-baked technologies which are financially lucrative providing partial solutions but actually end up accentuating environmental problems.This entails survey and data collection, real-time monitoring of pollution levels and finding the cause and effect of the current technologies in vogue to zero in on its source. A source-based mitigation in a decentralised manner holds the key to sustainability.The surveys clearly indicate that life expectancy has actually reduced from 6-12 years at various places depending upon the intensity of pollution. The death toll too has gone up by 30%, solely due to air pollution, which claims at least seven million lives in the world every year.Similarly, public health has deteriorated, particularly among old people and children. Lack of proper oxygen has adverse multiple effect on the otherwise mutually supporting ecosystem. A weak link in the chain makes it vulnerable to accidental failures.Action points mainly include greener habitat, encouraging walking and cycling as well as use of public transport, segregating waste at source and converting it to manure. Further actions could include reducing and recycling plastic waste, encouraging use of natural fibres and earthen materials for making sustainable products, and sensitising children on various issues.We can eventually focus on asserting as well as pursuing the government to implement laws that support environmental health, adopting available technology to minimise carbon footprint, saving electricity, adopting solar options, using electric vehicles and evolving innovative ways in collaboration with stakeholders, locally as well as globally.Less developed countries have incongruence and inconsistency in their developmental cycle. But one needs to take action in a balanced and graduated manner with a positive mindset. To unlearn and relearn these harsh facts, critical decisionmaking for survival is the need of the hour. We need to take a fresh look at some data.What we thought would happen in 50 years, has actually occurred in 10 years, as the temperature of the planet has increased by 1.5 degrees Celsius. We as a country are reportedly below the WHO standards. UP has 13 times higher pollution as per the neo norms. A citizen loses 10-12 years of life expectancy in Lucknow, which is barely a digit less than Delhi. The annual particulate pollution rate is 22%. Even this needs to be reduced drastically. NCAP is aiming to reduce it in aggregate by 30% before 2025.We need to follow a carbon resilient and low carbon lifestyle and maintain a sustainable health system.

"'Industrial waste being dumped, burnt near CPR'","Gurgaon: Residents of AVL36 Gurgaon on Tuesday expressed concerns over the rampant dumping and burning of industrial waste by the Central Peripheral Road (CPR). They alleged that industrial waste dumped by the CPR was often being set on fire and remained ablaze for days, making it difficult for them to breathe. The authorities concerned had failed to check offenders despite repeated complaints, residents added. /Shailash Garg, one of the residents, said, ""There have been regular dumping of industrial waste just opposite our society and then the waste is set on fire. We witnessed one such incident today (Tuesday).""He said that the waste was extremely hazardous and emitted black smoke, as well as highly toxic gases, causing air pollution. ""The pollution is adversely impacting the health of the residents living here. We have been regularly complaining about the matter but the authorities have not paid any heed to our concerns,"" added Garg.Residents said that the authorities should be vigilant and take punitive action against the offenders. Amerendra Jha, a resident, said, ""We have been contacting the fire tender to douse the fires. However, until strict action is taken against the offenders, they will keep flouting norms.""He claimed that the smoke released in the area was causing throat and eye irritation among residents, forcing them to keep balcony doors and windows closed.When contacted, a senior official with Haryana State Pollution Control Board said, ""We did not know about this matter.

Madhya Pradesh: Cracker of an eco-friendly Diwali this year,"BHOPAL: The district collector's order on sale & use of crackers issued under section 144 of the CrPC states ""only green crackers and reduced emission improved crackers"" can be sold and used this Diwali. It further says that crackers manufactured with use of barium salt, joint crackers (ladi bombs) and which create noise of 125 decibel four metre away from where it's burst are banned. The crackers manufactured with the use of antimony, lithium, mercury, arsenic lead and strontium chromate are also banned.If one goes to a vendor selling crackers and asks for green crackers, he says ""yes"" and asks you to select the crackers, giving an impression that all the crackers are ""green"". But, how does one distinguish between a green cracker and an ordinary one?/ MP Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) official, Neeraj Verma, when asked this question said, ""The companies write 'green crackers' on the pack. Only crackers manufactured by registered companies are allowed to be sold. You can't distinguish otherwise at the time of buying between green crackers and ordinary ones, but since the companies mention ""green crackers"" on the pack, there is no problem. Besides, the vendors have given an undertaking at the collector office that they would sell only the green crackers. However, green crackers have different ingredients than the ordinary ones and they are dearer too, so there may be some who may have some stock of ordinary crackers too.""Green crackers or eco-friendly crackers are manufactured from ""alternative"" raw material for reduced emission and lesser sound.According to experts, green crackers don't contain aluminium, barium, potassium nitrate, carbon and such material, making them eco-friendly. According to estimates, green crackers are 30% less polluting compared to ordinary ones. Barium, which has been banned by the supreme court in manufacturing of crackers, is responsible for heavy smoke and emissions, and it's not used in the making of green crackers. Green crackers not only reduce air pollution; it has also been reported that regular crackers emit about 160 decibels of sound, whereas green crackers have a sound level of 110-125 decibels. District collector has also constituted a team of officials to ensure compliance of his order for sale and use of green crackers. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Celebrate green #Diwali2021 by gifting plants to your loved ones,"The pandemic is not over yet. We never know, the virus might be still lurking round the corner, waiting for an opportunity to strike back with a vengeance. And now that COVID cases are on the rise again post Durga Puja, it's all the more important we continue following hygienic and healthy habits during Diwali celebrations. The best thing to do in such a situation is to go green, literally!/ Nature has its unique ways of protecting us. So, this Diwali, show your affection to your friends and relatives by sending them thoughtful, eco-friendly gifts. You can either send them a bouquet of flowers or gift them plants. ""Gifting plants on Diwali is perhaps the best thing to do in this pandemic. The lockdowns, last year, have helped Mother Nature heal to some extent and the only way to ensure a better future is to plant more trees and increase the green cover around us. While it's not always possible to do that on a large scale, we can always start at home. Nature already has a treasure trove of plants that not only produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide, but are also efficient at removing pollutants from the ambient air. So, why not grow a few at home, said Sushmita Banerjee, a schoolteacher. 'Demand for indoor plants more than flowers'No wonder the demand for air-purifying indoor plants is on the rise this Diwali. Asish Sarawgee from a flower and plants boutique chain, on Elgin Road, said, ""People have become very health conscious ever since the pandemic hit us. Hence, they have started buying more and more air-purifying plants, like Jade, Snake plants and Syngonium - both for their homes and gifting purposes. These plants absorb toxic chemicals present in the air and also improve the quality of air. Though people are also opting for Oriental lilies and chocolates as Diwali gifts, the demand for plants, in general, is more than flowers this year."" Though winter is the season of flowers and people usually buy rose, marigold, petunia and zinnia, this year is witnessing a new trend. Shubhojeet Mondal, owner of a nursery at Gariahat Market, said, ""The sales of plants have definitely gone up during the pandemic. Not just flowering plants, people are buying houseplants that provide high amounts of oxygen. Winter flowers, seeds for herb garden, veggies and indoor plants are also in demand this year."" According to Mohan Naskar, owner of a 27-year-old nursery on Avishikta connector, people have now become more aware of the benefits of plants. ""Though sales of flower plants remain the same this Diwali, I noticed a distinct urge among people to go for air-purifying plants just before Diwali. Interestingly, most of my new clients were youngsters, which convinced me that people are taking up gardening for a good reason during the pandemic.""'Plants are natural air purifiers' Smita Bhadra, a botany teacher, said, ""Not just outdoors, study has revealed that air inside homes in cities have become unsafe with high levels of pollutants found in it. Indoor air pollution can increase the risk of stroke, respiratory infections in children, heart disease etc. Plants are natural air purifiers. They can help remove dangerous compounds from fuels, furnishings and clothing. Alfalfa, petunia, red kidney bean and cotton plant can absorb and accumulate sulphur dioxide that emit from fireworks during Diwali.""'Greenery has a therapeutic effect on our mind and body' The best part about indoor plants is that they are mostly resilient and low-maintenance. Naresh Mondal, who runs a nursery in Salt Lake, said, ""Greenery has a therapeutic effect on our mind and body. Jade is known to be particularly effective in absorbing toluene emitted from gasoline, paints, and thus the demand is high for this plant. It is a succulent that is easy to grow indoors and requires minimal watering. According to Japanese folklore, the plant brings prosperity and luck. No wonder people buy it for gifting purposes during Diwali.""  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pollution due to crackers can adversely impact health of Covid recovered: Docs,"Nagpur: Diwali crackers can have adverse impact on the health of those recovered from Covid-19, caution doctors. With their lungs already scarred from the disease, exposure to toxic smoke can lead to severe outcomes, including decreased lung function.According to interventional pulmonologist Dr Sameer Arbat, people who have had Covid-19 are at a major risk from air pollution caused due to burning of crackers. ""Most patients who have suffered from this disease have either compromised or reduced lung function. /During Diwali, there is an immense increase in particulate matter and other volatile organic compounds in the ambient air. When exposed to this, those recovered from Covid-19 are prone to cough, difficulty in breathing, and might also experience severe respiratory ailments,"" said Arbat.Citing a recent study which found that level of sulphur dioxide during three days of Diwali was 200 times more than the safe permissible limit given, chief pulmonologist and secretary of the Indian Chest Society, Dr Rajesh Swarnakar, said, ""Crackers have harmful air pollutants and gaseous matter like carbon monoxide, ozone and sulphur dioxide .They cause irritation to respiratory tract lining (mucosal layer) causing cough, excessive sputum production and swelling inside wind pipes. This is especially dangerous not just for asthma and allergy patients but now also for Covid recovered. It's prudent that these patients stay indoors during the time fire crackers smog is lingering in the air.""The expert advised influenza vaccine to be taken before Diwali every year for all and pneumococcal vaccine for those above 50 years and for below 50 years who are diabetic, have renal problem or Covid recovered. ""These crackers additionally contain charcoal to burn fine particles of PM2.5 which enter in deeper tissue of lungs and even in blood circulation. Burning a single fulzadi, anar produces smoke equivalent to 200 cigarettes,"" said Dr Swarnarkar.The expert feels that shifting to electronic fire crackers is a healthier way out. ""They are now available in market and create sound and light like crackers but do not emit smoke,"" he said.Suggesting that while Diwali is a good opportunity to relieve the pandemic stress, Dr Arbat stated that people should not risk their health at the cost of celebrations. ""Last year, we saw a lot of post-Covid patients facing difficulty from air pollution caused by crackers. They need to take all precautions to stay healthy,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Saturday reported 'very poor' air quality index (AQI) in Agra at 390 (average AQI of last 24 hours). Particulate matter 2.5 remained a prominent air pollutant, eight times higher than normal limits. According to doctors, prolonged exposure to PM 2.5 beyond the safe limits can harm the respiratory system as the ultra fine particulates can find their way deep into the lungs and also enter the bloodstream.

10 per cent of eye problems in city related to pollution,"Hyderabad: About 10 per cent of all eye problems reported in Hyderabad are linked to air pollution, particularly the high presence of particulate matter and obnoxious gases in the city atmosphere, reveals a research study conducted by LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad.According to the study, the most common eye complaint linked to atmospheric pollution is allergic eye disease (AED), which is reported by one in every 10 people visiting ophthalmologists. The researchers have found ""a correlation between the meteorological parameters such as environmental temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed and pollution with the temporal pattern of presentation of recent onset allergic eye disease (AED)"".The researchers said their finding suggests that there is ""a clear pattern of certain environmental factors with the temporal pattern of AED in the population of Hyderabad district, with a peak prevalence seen in May and the lowest seen in August. An increase in humidity and rainfall contributes to a lower prevalence of AED cases during the year, whereas an increase in temperature and ozone at ground level conversely contributes to a higher prevalence of AED cases,"" they said.The research team comprised Anthony Vipin Das and Sayan Basu. /The results of the research were published in the scientific journal, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.The cross-sectional hospital-based study included patients over 21 years of age with recent onset of symptoms of less than three months duration. Correlation analysis was performed with the local environmental rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and air pollution. Of the 25,354 patients studied from Hyderabad, 2494 (9.84%) patients were diagnosed with AED, of which 1062 (4.19%) patients had recent onset of symptoms, the study said.""An increase in rainfall and humidity was associated with a lower prevalence, and an increase of temperature and ground-level ozone was associated with a higher prevalence of AED cases during the year among children and adolescents.

""It is the advantage Mumbai has over Delhi,"" he adds.By comparison, the pandemic year of 2020 saw a poor AQI (270) despite fewer firecrackers while the 2019 Diwali was cleaner with better air quality due to low temperatures and gusty winds.According to Sutaria, to ensure that maximum wind blows and humidity remains at bay, the citizens should strive to reduce urban heat-island effects. ""The buildings should avoid using glasses and adopt eco-friendly materials.

Women construction workers bear ailments as occupational hazards,"New Delhi: From breathing difficulty to skin diseases - most women construction workers put up with these ailments as ""occupational hazards"" with no access to regular health checkups on work sites. In a study that profiles 390 women construction workers in Delhi, to understand their perceptions about pollution, 87% indicated they could suffer from lung disease and coughs due to their occupation. Apart from this, the respondents were of the view that air pollution at construction sites could cause redness in the eyes (52%), breathing issues (49%), skin problems (45%) and heart problems (4%). Nearly 75% respondents reported feeling sick or uncomfortable when the air quality is bad.Several women participants during the 'focus group discussions' stated that they suffered from skin diseases and had to consult doctors. Some of them also complained about breathing issues and body aches due to carrying heavy loads at construction sites.In construction, most women are involved in unskilled manual jobs like carrying cement, sand and bricks, helping in preparing cement mortar and carrying it, digging, breaking stones etc. A few women do brick laying (17%) and plastering of walls (8%).These findings are part of a first of its kind study that highlights the sheer lack of focus on the impact of environmental pollution on women construction workers. /It brings out the gender perspective from three resettlement colonies - Sawda Ghevra, Bakkarwala and Gokulpuri - in Delhi. The study makes a case for more studies and awareness building on the subject.Serious environmental problems flagged by the women included the problem of open drainage in the colonies where they lived (60%), supply of contaminated water and irregular water supply (55%), open defecation (40%), unsanitary conditions (38%) and air pollution from various sources (37%). People are generally unaware of PM2.5, PM10 particles and Air Quality Index.Majority of the respondents (83%) were aware about the importance of sprinkling water to control construction dust. Slightly less than 50% reported such measures being practiced at the place of their work.Nearly 68% women felt that focusing on air pollution on work sites may negatively influence growth and employment. Around 40% of the respondents reported that there is fear among women construction workers to talk about the issue of air pollution at the sites. Amongst them around, 80% of the women feared losing their jobs if they voiced concerns. This fear was evident in focused group discussions too.""This study was aimed at understanding ground realities to develop a strategic plan to build, increase and strengthen construction workers' voices on the issue of air pollution in Delhi,"" explained Roshini Suparna Diwakar from civil society organisation Mahila Housing Trust that conducted the study with Purpose and CMSR Consultants. MHT has now started a campaign to create a group of AQI ambassadors within the community in these resettlements to build awareness on pollution.Majority of the women workers surveyed for the study were poor - nearly 30% had annual income less than Rs 25,000 and slightly less than 50% had an annual income in the range of Rs 25,000-50,000. ""As part of the awareness building exercise, women construction workers and community leaders have been trained in how to use portable AQI monitors and collect data on air quality,"" Diwakar said. ""With real-time, site-specific air quality data, women construction workers can take precautions to protect themselves and their families,"" she added. The air quality data collected will be assessed by MHT to identify patterns and solution for them contextually. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Most polluted areas were expected to be Navi Mumbai, BKC and Chembur.While 2020 saw a poor AQI despite fewer firecrackers, 2019 Diwali was cleaner with better air quality due to low temperatures and gusty winds.The reason for reduction in intensity of pollution, says founder of Safar (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting & Research) Gufran Beig, was the wind that gushes in from the sea at high speed. /""It is Mumbai's advantage over Delhi,"" he said.""Pollution usually picks up at 1am after Diwali night. Mumbai's proximity to the sea and breeze offers an advantage. It drizzled the next day, taking away the severity that pollution may have caused,"" said Ronak Sutaria, founder of Respirer Living Sciences, which deals in air quality monitoring.Proximity to coast helped city beat pollution bluesSutaria said that to ensure maximum wind blows in and humidity remains at bay, people should strive to reduce urban heat-island effects.

Delhi air 'severe' for 3rd day but winds bring some relief,"NEW DELHI: Delhi-NCR continued to suffer ""air emergency"" conditions with the air quality staying in the ""severe"" category for the third day in a row on Sunday even as weather conditions changed slightly in favour of dispersion of pollutants.However, moderate winds at 10kmph speed were not enough to provide the city breathable air, as the share of smoke in the city's PM2.5 levels from stubble-burning in Punjab and Haryana spiked from 41% on Saturday to 48% on Sunday - the season's highest for the fourth successive day./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/As per the Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi's AQI on Sunday remained ""severe"" at 428, a shade better than 437 a day earlier.  Gusty Winds Delhi's Sole Saviours, For Now  Neighbouring NCR cities fared no better. Noida on Sunday recorded an overall AQI of 446 and Ghaziabad 455. Gurugram too was in the ""severe"" at 419. ""Though, the farm fire count (in satellite images) dropped from 5,159 on Saturday to 4,189 on Sunday, a slight drop in local wind speed clubbed with consistent intrusion of excessive emissions increased the share of smoke from these blazes in the city's already polluted air. The winds were there but overburdened with consistent emissions, they were simply not enough to ventilate all of it,"" said Gufran Beig from SAFAR. While weather analysts and pollution monitoring agencies expect a little more improvement in air quality to the upper end of ""very poor"" or probably lower end of ""severe"". That's the kind of air quality Delhi can expect for the next few days as stubble burning continues in neighbouring states, experts said. Though northwesterly winds will continue carrying additional emissions from stubble burning into the city, the Met department however expects winds to gain pace and disperse pollutants to a greater extent. ""The wind speed varied, though it was above 10kmph towards the afternoon on Sunday. We expect the wind speed to increase over next few days and improve the situation here. Sunday also saw improvement in the visibility and a drop in humidity levels by 10% to 20%. We expect better visibility and wind speed on Monday with further lowering of moisture that may further improve air quality and visibility,"" said R K Jenamani, senior scientist, India Meteorological Department (IMD). According to the CPCB, PM2.5, or particles in air with diameter of less than 2.5 microns, continues to be the dominant factor in air pollution. The PM2.5 on levels hovered between 306.9 and 322.1 micrograms per cubic metres on Sunday against 323.3 and 413.7 micrograms per cubic metres a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic metres. ""The weather conditions would remain almost the same on Monday as on Sunday. So there won't be much change in the air quality as stubble burning is likely to continue. The maximum respite that the city can expect is AQI in the 'very poor' category,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. ""The wind is there and moisture is dropping, but had it not been for stubble burning smoke, the condition could have been slightly better,"" said Shambhavi Shukla, deputy program manager, air pollution, centre for science and environment (CSE). According to the SAFAR, the AQI is expected to improve but slowly and only over next two days. ""In view of the favourable wind speed and direction and high fire counts since yesterday, the AQI recovery is extremely slow in spite of moderate wind speed. The stubble-fire related contribution simulated by the SAFAR model has risen to the highest level of 48% of this season with effective fire count at 4,189. AQI is forecasted to improve but stay in high end of very poor to severe category in next two days,"" said a statement from SAFAR. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

""We bought a house in Dehradun in 2019 and stay here whenever we come to Uttarakhand, either on holidays or at the start of winters when air pollution rises in Delhi. We came for the weekend but are now planning to extend our stay by a few days more,"" said Duggal. Tourists are also reaching Almora, Ranikhet, Marchula, Bageshwar and Mukteshwar in Nainital district, though their numbers are small.President of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Uttarakhand, Sandeep Sahni, said, ""Traditionally, people did not venture out on Diwali, but now we are noticing that the trend is changing. Nowadays, an increasing number of people from Delhi visit Uttarakhand during festivals. An important factor might be the high pollution levels in Delhi during Diwali. This year, too, we are witnessing a spurt in tourists from Delhi in places such as Mussoorie, Nainital, Rishikesh and Ramnagar.""

"Poor air quality, cold weather hit asthma, COPD, Covid recovered patients","Nagpur: The dip in temperature and poor air quality due to increase in pollution levels have badly affected the Covid recovered, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonoary disease (COPD) patients.Asthma and chest OPDs are running full with patients who were healthy just one week back.The patients, including a lot of kids, are suddenly now wheezing, coughing, having fever, cold and cough.City pulmonologists said they are also seeing a lot of patients who recovered from Covid in March-April period beside regular asthma and COPD patients. Some of these patients were mild cases and didn't require hospitalization or oxygen during Covid infection, doctors said.Child specialists said kids have been at receiving end of the poor air quality to a great extent. Doctors advised that people need to be alert and immediately see a doctor in case they get any symptom.Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said he has been seeing a lot of Covid recovered patients in last one week. /""With onset of winter and post Diwali generally, there is a spike in cases of asthma and COPD patients. This time, recovered patients, who had mild Covid, are also more. They complain of tightness or heaviness in chest, cough, and cold,"" he said.Dr Sarnaik, who is member of district Covid task force, said some tests are prescribed for complete evaluation of such cases. ""If Covid recovered patients have any symptoms, they must immediately see a doctor. Lung function test, chest Xray, allergy blood tests are done,"" he said.As the pandemic turned 'endemic' and fears evaporating from minds, people seemed to have also discarded their treatment documents. ""Covid history mentioning what type of infection it was, did O2 drop, pneumonia are helpful indicators for the treating doctor. But many patients say they have misplaced the records,"" he said.Some patients also try to hide their Covid history though it serves as reference for further evaluation. ""They should not conceal the Covid history,"" he added.Pediatric intensivist Dr Vivek Charde said asthma and COPD patients need to be managed by increasing their dose of inhalers. ""Air pollution, cold weather and viral infection worsen asthma,"" he said.Dr Abhishek Madhura, assistant professor at GMCH department of paeditrics, said problems get aggravated for COPD patients. ""Condition of all the asthmatic patients, reporting now, was in control a week ago. Now, their doses have been increased. Air pollution is major reason affecting their health,"" he said.

"Ban up in smoke, garbage burning in the open choking lungs of capital","Lucknow: Burning of garbage in the open continues in the city despite it being one of the major factors responsible for the spike in air pollution levels. Lucknow Municipal Corporation had prohibited garbage burning about four years ago with a provision of slapping a fine of Rs 5,000 on those caught violating the ban. The rule also provided for deducting a day's wage from the civic body's sanitary workers as penalty, if they were found burning garbage in the open.However, TOI in its reality check found that open garbage burning by workers and people is still in practice in areas like Lalbagh, Latouche Road, Rajajipuram, Mahanagar, Naka Hindola, Madiaon, Aliganj, Jankipuram, Gomtinagar, Daliganj and a few other areas. /In winters, such activities cause more air pollution because smoke combines with tiny water droplets in mist or fog to form smog which remains suspended in the atmosphere for long. Residents complain of heavy breathing, nasal congestion and headache due to air pollution caused by garbage burning. Some also claimed that their complaints to the LMC helpline in this regard have gone unheard so far. Sunil Srivastava (65), Mahanagar, said that he has stopped going for morning walks because of the problem. ""Since I am diabetic and have lung issues, morning walk has been recommended by the doctor, but instead of fresh air, we get smoke in the morning. Sanitary workers after sweeping the street, put dry leaves and garbage on fire, instead of carrying them to the nearest dumping yard,"" he added. ""I feel suffocated everyday because of garbage burning outside my home. I don't know if the neighbours or sanitary workers are doing it. The authorities concerned should take some strict measures to stop this,"" said Shubham Chaturvedi, resident of Jiamau, Gomtinagar. Several residents at Latouche Road pointed out wires and cycle tubes are also burnt by some in the area. Anuj Verma, a resident, said, ""This area has lots of electronics and cycle repair shops, all the waste from them is thrown on roads and later burnt by the sweepers in the morning. Our locality has three patients suffering from asthma, but they don't care.""Additional municipal commissioner Abhay Pandey said, ""If any worker is found to be burning garbage, then their salaries will be deducted. Citizens can also lodge complaints regarding garbage burning on ""Lucknow One"" app so we can take action on the offenders.""

Indore: Pneumonia cases in first 6 months more than double of last year's total,"INDORE: Pneumonia cases reported in Indore in first six months of current financial year are more than double of those reported in the last financial year, showed records.The figures from HIMS portal showed that the district had witnessed 1579 pneumonia cases till November 10 from April this year. The district however, only reported 644 cases in April 2020 to March this year, showed record.HoD Respiratory medicine MGM Dr Salil Bhargava said, ""Because of similarities in symptoms of pneumonia and Covid-19, the cases are counted or treated like pandemic virus infection only.""""Covid-19 infected persons are coming with high lung involvement. So, the number of pneumonia cases were less last year"", said Dr Bhargava. /As the Covid-19 virus infection decreased the pneumonia cases were reported, said Dr Bhargava.The health facilities remained almost non-function from April to July initially and operationalised on less than their capacity on emergency basis for the rest of the period with a surge in Covid-19.Covid-19 outbreak was reported on March 23 last year in the district, when four cases were identified. On the question of trends in pneumonia cases over the years Dr Bhargava said, ""We don't have any exact figures of the disease to comment upon. The Covid-19 infection has further made conditions worse as we are not in position to observe any other thing.""It can be said that with the rise in factors affecting the health of lungs like pollution and other things, the disease must have increased in the last one decade or so, added Dr Bhargava.On this question, Dr. Navdeep Labana MD Respiratory Medicine, MGM Medical college said, ""Air pollution causes millions of premature deaths every year and affects healthy years of life. It not only affects lungs but could also cause Asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), pneumonitis, ischaemic heart disease and stroke in adults.""""It could impact lung growth and function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma in children"", said Dr Labana.

Vrindavan & Agra continue to reel under air pollution with AQI in 'severe' category,"AGRA: The air quality in Vrindavan and Agra remained hazardous on Friday with the Air Quality Index (AQI) remaining in the ""severe"" category, continuously for the past several days.While AQI in Agra stood at 405, which was 32 notches less than the previous day, AQI in Vrindavan was recorded at 471, 13 notches higher than the previous day. Experts warned that polluted air severely threatens to affect those with existing diseases.The index, monitored by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) across the country, showed that out of total 15 cities in UP, eight were found in ""severe"" category - Bulandshahr and Noida (488), Ghaziabad (486), Greater Noida (478), Vrindavan (471), Baghpat (454), Agra (405) and Meerut (404).An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"".The major pollutant in the air was recorded particulate matter - PM 2.5 which is the minutest and finest particle that is able to travel deep into the respiratory tract and the 24-hour permissible level is 60 micrograms per cubic meter.With the increase in pollution levels, doctors in the city advised that people, especially elders, should avoid morning walks. /For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Admin moots rapid measures to curb air pollution,"Lucknow: The district administration on Friday held an emergency meeting of officials from various departments to discuss steps to check air pollution in the city. TOI has been highlighting issues like rise in air pollution and failure of the municipal corporation to check garbage burning. Convened by district magistate Abhishek Prakash, the meeting was attended by the officials from LDA, LMC, forest, agriculture, traffic police and transport departments.Graded Response Action Plan, developed by UPPCB, was discussed to ensure implementation of micro-level preventive measures like repair of roads, laying of tiles or green grass on the footpath, sweeping of arterial road and swift disposal of solid garbage piled up on the roadsides. Contractors involved in construction of buildings, roads and bridges have been asked to ensure arrangement for green net, anti-smoke gun, PTZ camera, selfdust control audit and water sprinkling.The DM also directed all the departments to take steps to control air pollution and submit daily action taken report at 6pm regularly. ""Take action against those who burn garbage and seize vehicles which are unfit for plying. Ensure no farmer burns crop waste in the fields,"" the DM said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Dusty roads spike pollution in city,"Lucknow: Continuous drives by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) to sprinkle water on broken roads to control dust and check air pollution is not providing desired results.A reality check by the TOI in nearly two dozen localities found that the number of damaged and dusty roads is far more than what the civic body covers daily. As a result, the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city continues to be in poor category.According to a survey conducted by the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), broken and dust-laden roads contribute around 87.1% of total air pollution in the city.The dust raised by moving vehicles remains suspended in the air for long and combines with mist/fog during winter to create smog, comprising aerosols which are responsible for the continued haze being witnessed these days.LMC has eight trucks for sprinkling of water on roads and five for anti-smog spray. These vehicles cover around 80-85km of road networks daily. /However, LMC has 236km of road network in the city, of which many stretches are in a bad shape. Though repair work is underway, the pace is slow. Some roads under LDA, PWD, State and National Highways Authorities are also damaged.TOI reality check found dust-laden and damaged roads in Mahanagar, Jankipuram, Jankipuram Extension, Aliganj, Gomtinagar, Alambagh, Aashiana, Hazratganj, Nishatganj, Lajpatnagar, SGPGI road, LDA Colony and Kanpur Road, among others.Residents complain that bad roads not only lead to accidents but the air pollution caused by it leads to itching and redness in eyes and shortness of breath.Residents of Alambagh said dust was causing respiratory problems for adults as well as their kids. ""My child is allergic to dust. I also suffer from silicosis and our doctor has strongly advised us to wear mask even inside the house,"" said a resident, Kartar Singh.""I feel irritation and itching in my eyes and can't even sleep properly because of the dust entering our house. Repeated requests to our corporator for repairing of the stretch have gone unheard,"" said Abhijeet Singh of Nishatganj.Shalini Tripathi of Telibagh colony said, ""Almost all the roads in our locality are broken and riddled with potholes. A thin layer of haze envelops the area during the day. As a precaution, we have to keep windows closed all the time. We have bought an air purifier because air pollution aggravates the condition of my asthamatic mother-in-law.""In an official statement, municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi said LMC had deputed five anti-smog trucks and several water sprinkling trucks in all eight zones of the city to settle the dust.

Single-Day Covid Tally At Over 3-Month High,"New Delhi: The capital on Friday recorded 62 cases of Covid in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day tally in more than three months.The state health department, in its latest bulletin, also confirmed two fresh fatalities due to the viral infection - the spread of which is on the rise again, though it is nowhere near the alarming levels witnessed in the runup to the second wave of the pandemic in April and May. Back then, there was an acute shortage of beds, oxygen and essential drugs at hospitals in Delhi.With the new cases, the Covid infection tally in the city reached 14,40,332. Of this, over 14.1 lakh patients have recovered from the disease.A total of 49,874 tests were conducted a day ago, including 38,408 RTPCR/CBNAAT/True Nat tests, while the rest were rapid antigen tests. The toll stands at 25,093, including the two reported on Friday. /Before this, the city did not report any death due to Covid in November.Last month, Delhi recorded four deaths due to the infection while five people had succumbed to the viral disease in September. The number of active cases in the city is 371. Of these, 152 patients are being treated in various city hospitals and 156 are in home isolation.There are 111 containment zones in the capital. Delhi reported 25 Covid cases on Monday, 33 on Tuesday, 54 on Wednesday and 40 on Thursday.Doctors say there is an urgent need to step up measures to prevent the disease spread, which includes increased testing, stricter enforcement of mask rules and speeding up of the vaccination drive.""The increase in cases as well as the positivity rate is marginal. However, that should not make us complacent. We need to increase testing to be able to identify potential areas where disease is spreading and enforce strict measures to prevent overcrowding. Mask rules have to be enforced strictly,"" said a senior doctor from Lok Nayak hospital.The hospital has 470 Covid beds, of which only six were occupied on Friday. Other hospitals, too, have very low occupancy of Covid beds, data shows. ""We cannot afford another spike in Covid cases as we are struggling with a rise in OPD and IPD visits due to mosquito-borne illnesses and respiratory problems caused by air pollution,"" Dr Arun Gupta, the president of Delhi Medical Council, said.

Exposure to pollutants may damage kids' brain,"New Delhi: The effect of pollution on the heart and lungs is well-established, but doctors say there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that prolonged exposure to the pollutants can damage a child's brain.Particulate matter (PM) less than 2.5 micrometres in size that are suspended in the air can enter into the brain through the olfactory nerves directly and damage the brain.Also, various components of polluted air like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, etc can dissolve in the blood and reach the brain.According to Dr Sheffali Gulati, professor and head of the child neurology division at AIIMS, the fine particulate matters can activate the microglia, the primary innate immune effector cells of the central nervous system (CNS), on entering the brain, leading to inflammatory response causing accumulation of proteins in the brain. ""It can lead to an early ageing process of the brain in children at a very young age,"" she said.Dr Gulati added that animal studies have shown that significant inflammatory infiltrates observed in various areas of the brain because of exposure to toxic elements in the air.The AIIMS doctor said another significant effect of air pollution on a child's brain is seen through mothers. ""In children born to mothers who were exposed to significantly polluted air during their pregnancy, the incidence of autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, other behavioural issues like anxiety, depression, etc are higher than controls,"" she explained.In 2017, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) had released a report that warned about serious consequences of children due to prolonged exposure to air pollution.The Unicef report, titled Danger in the air, explained that brain damage can happen through several mechanisms. /First, it stated, particulate matter can cause neuro-inflammation by damaging the blood-brain barrier - a thin, delicate membrane that protects the brain from toxic substances.Second, exposure to air pollutant particles like magnetite can lead to oxidative stress, which is often the cause of neurodegenerative diseases.""Not only do pollutants harm babies' developing lungs, but they can also permanently damage their developing brains and, thus, their futures,"" Unicef executive director Anthony Lake had said.

Gurgaon chokes on 'severe' air for second day on the trot,"Gurgaon: The city's air quality index (AQI) recorded a slight dip but remained in the 'severe' category for the second consecutive day on Saturday. While it stood at 441 on the day, it was 448 the previous day.According to the officials from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a reduction in moisture content during the day and marginal rise in wind speed have allowed slight dispersal of pollutants, but the AQI is likely to stay in the 'severe' to 'very poor' categories for the next few days due to unfavourable weather conditions.All monitoring stations in the city reported 'severe' air on Saturday. The AQI reading was 435 at Gwalpahari, 403 at Sector 51, 414 at Teri Gram and 409 at Vikas Sadan. /""Winds have picked up speed during the daytime with a speed of 6-8 kmph, which has allowed the dispersal of pollutants to some extent and improved visibility. However, the air quality level is likely to remain 'severe' or 'very poor' due to dip in temperature, increased humidity and slower winds which will prevent dispersal,"" the IMD said.The minimum temperature dropped from 13.4 degrees Celsius on Friday to 11.3 degrees on Saturday, while the daytime temperature was at 25.5 degrees, three notches below the season's normal.Officials from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said they are making ""all efforts"" to improve air quality. ""We implemented precautionary measures from October 1 and now, we have optimitised our efforts and are continuously engaging every stakeholder to mitigate the air pollution. We urge residents not to carry out activities which contribute to pollution such as open burning of waste, and encourage them to opt for carpooling,"" an official said.Activists, meanwhile, pointed towards lack of enforcement by government agencies for the rising AQI. ""Construction activities and waste burning are going on unabated and polluting industries and DG sets are being run without any checks. As of now, the government has no will to address this emergency situation,"" said Abhishek Srivastava, an environmental engineer and a member of Citizens For Clean Air, a residents' group.Doctors have advised people to avoid outdoor activities. ""People who have a history of respiratory diseases need to remain watchful. We should also have a good balanced diet which is rich in protein and avoid outdoor activities during the peak pollution times,"" said Dr Arunesh Kumar, senior consultant and head of the department of pulmonology at Paras Hospital.Meanwhile, Delhi continued to be a gas chamber for the second day in a row. Its air quality remained under 'severe' category despite a slight improvement towards Saturday noon due to supportive weather conditions and drop in farm fire share in the city's pollution.The pollution monitoring agencies expect a very slight and temporary relief on Sunday to lower end of 'severe' or upper end of 'very-poor'. According to the weather department, the slight improvement within the severe category on Saturday was a result of increased wind speed. However, the winds are expected to slow down from Sunday evening again, thereby increasing the pollution levels. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Dr Puneet Khanna, HOD, department of Respiratory Medicine, Manipal Hospitals, Delhi, adds, ""People should reduce the usage of vehicles to as little as possible. One should carpool with family members while keeping social distancing norms in mind, and try to cut down the commuting time by requesting the management to allow work from home as much as possible. Cover their nose and mouth completely with a good quality N95 mask. One should ideally step out for a stretch of two-three hours and then take rest indoors before stepping out again. Elderly, young children and those with lung diseases, diabetes, hypertension or cardiac diseases should avoid venturing out at all. Avoid exercising outdoors early in the morning and in the evening. Also, avoid running and marathons during this time. It is better to limit your exercises to minimum.""He advises that large gatherings should also be avoided during this time. ""These are dangerous from the COVID-19 and the pollution point of view. Limit your movement to as little as possible,"" he shares. Keep windows closed, use air purifiers, avoid outdoor physical activities and stay in touch with your docs, say doctorsDr Vineeta Tandon, Consultant, Internal Medicine, PSRI Hospital, Delhi, says, ""Pollution has a huge impact on our health, and it is a misnomer that it impacts only the lungs. Yes, it does impact our lungs but it also has a damaging impact on our eyes, heart, and even skin. Children and the elderly who have compromised immune systems are highly vulnerable. Apart from staying indoors, keep windows closed and use air purifiers at home. Wear an N-95 mask while stepping out as a cloth mask would not help in protecting you from polluted air. Remain hydrated as it improves the blood flow and can improve oxygen levels in the body, while keeping your skin exfoliated. Wear sunglasses while driving a two-wheeler. When you return home, wash your eyes with fresh running water. Those who have respiratory problems should avoid stepping out and should get in touch with their doctors. Those with cardiovascular problems should also monitor their health regularly and watch out for any alarming signs.""

Lung damaging activities associated with cancer,"Lung cancer is a disease in which abnormal cells in the lungs proliferate uncontrollably, resulting in a tumor. The most common cancer in 2020 according to WHO was lung cancer which 2.21 million deaths after breast cancer which reported 2.26 million deaths.The exact reason why lung cancer happens can be classically defined as 'multifactorial'. This can be environmental factors and then some genetic factors as well. A slight increase of prevalence is noted recently in young women, and cause of it remains an enigma. We as Oncologist, regularly deal with cancer of the lung, head and neck and even gastric, bladder etc., primarily caused by excessive tobacco (smokeless/ smoked/ hooka/ second-hand smoke) intake. /In most cases, what begins as a fad turns into an obsession leading to the life-threatening disease before the victim realizes it. Smoking is the most critical risk factor for lung cancer development. Two-thirds of all lung cancers are associated with smoking. But lung cancers in non- smokers remain a unique separate entity(fewer than 100 cigarettes in a lifetime). According to one data, 19% of all women lung cancers in US were non-smokers. Some other factors that lead to lung cancer include:Radon, a radioactive gas found naturally in soil and rocks. Radon is a gaseous decay product of uranium-238 and radium-226 which damages lung epithelium by emitting alpha- particles. Aizawl distt, Mizoram has the highest concentration of indoor radon/ thoron and also the highest incidence of lung cancer in India.Occupational Exposure: Commonly associated toxins include asbestos, chromium, and arsenic and Occupational exposure to organic dust (mining industry).Arsenic has implicated as a cause of lung cancer where it contaminates drinking water. Whole-genome sequencing of the lung cancer of a never smoking patient with arsenic exposure revealed unusual tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutation.Dietary factors: Higher intake of fruits and vegetables and low fat food may be protective against lung cancer (healthiest dietary pattern).Indoor air pollutants such as vapors from cooking oil and the smoke from burning coal have been linked to lung cancer in women, particularly in Asia (India).Outdoor air pollution is also associated with lung cancer risk. Using ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as a measure of air pollution, there was a 15 to 27 percent increase in lung cancer mortality in never smokers. Underlying lung disease and treatment- Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, previous exposure to radiation or chemotherapy.Cancer Causing Viruses (oncogenic Viruses) like Human Papilloma Virus type 16 and 18. Also there is increased association with HIV infection.Genetic factors: lung cancer was significantly more common among those with a positive family history, particularly of early-onset lung cancer (50 years). Certain Chromosomal abnormalities have been identified and specific germline mutations have been identified in limited numbers of families with high rates of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in never smokers.Estrogens - The role of estrogens and other female hormones in lung cancer risk in women is uncertain, regardless of smoking status. Studies show that the majority of NSCLCs express the estrogen receptor beta. Relationship of lung cancer incidence to early menopause, use of hormone therapy (like tamoxifen or HRT), age at first birth and number of children. However the results are not consistent.Inflammation and other benign lung disease-The risk of lung cancer was elevated in patients with a history of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. The increased risk involve all histologic types of lung cancer (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell, small cell).Genetic conditions like alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiencyBody mass index - there is an inverse relationship between body mass index (BMI) and lung cancer (especially small cell lung cancer),however it could be associated comorbidities or other factors.Certain vitamin and beta carotene supplements have shown confounding results. Opium use (illicit drug derived from the poppy plantis associated with an increased, dose-dependent risk of developing lung cancer .Screening is a method of detecting cancer when there are no symptoms in a high-risk case: Low-dose helical CT scanning is the only early detection screening technique proven to reduce mortality in people at high risk of lung cancer. High risk individuals who require lung CT screening are long term smokers. Lung cancer screening by chest radiography and sputum cytology has not been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality rates.Remember that 'Cancer' is importantly a ""lifestyle disease"". Cancer may be curable if diagnosed early enough. Even if it isn't, the treatment should improve one's quality of life and help you live longer. Also, we as oncologist want to convey to every individual to make their lifestyle choices wisely. Each person has a right to his/her life and health, and the decision about it solely lies upon themselves.The article has been authored by Dr Niti Raizada, Director, Medical Oncology & Hemato-Oncology, Fortis La Femme Hospital, Richmond Road, Bangalore.

Pollution & weather change spike woes of respiratory illness patients,"Lucknow: The constant spike in air pollution is choking the city, leading to a steep rise in the number of patients with respiratory problems visiting outpatient departments (OPDs) of city hospitals.According to doctors, the condition of those already suffering from respiratory diseases has aggravated due to rise in air pollution before and after Diwali and change in weather.""Pollutants like particulate matter PM 2.5 and PM 10 stick to the windpipe and lungs hindering proper respiration. Our immune system gets activated against these foreign objects which results in inflammation. In this fight between foreign objects and our immune system, remodelling of our airways takes place which, in the long run, may lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), cancer, asthma and other respiratory tract problems,"" said Dr Ved Prakash, head of pulmonary and critical care medicine department at KGMU.""There is an increase in COPD patients. /Air pollution, dryness in the air and seasonal shift are contributing to the growth of virus and bacteria in our respiratory tract,"" he added.At Lok Bandhu Raj Narayan Combined Hospital, doctors have found a considerable rise in the number of respiratory patients just before and after Diwali.""From an average of nearly 70 patients a day, the number has gone up to 90 patients a day. Most of these patients already have comorbid conditions,"" hospital director Dr Ajay Tripathi said.At TB hospital in Thakurganj, the average number of patients has gone up from 30 to 45. ""Most patients complain of breathlessness and burning sensation in the eyes in the morning and evenings. Not only elderly patients, but middle-aged and young people are also visiting us with this problem,"" said hospital director Dr Anand Gupta.""Every year we see a surge in the patients of COPD, asthma and bronchitis because of pollution and season change, especially after Diwali. The trend is increasing with each passing year,"" said medical superintendent at BRD Hospital in Mahanagar, Dr Manish Shukla. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
11% patients screened in 44 medical college hospitals had COPD: Study,"Pune: A week-long screening programme across 44 medical college hospitals in India has found that 11% of the patients studied had Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The programme, organised by Pune's Chest Research and Training Private Limited (CREST), screened 2,440 patients in the OPDs of the hospitals.CREST director Dr Sundeep Salvi told TOI, ""Out of the 2,440 patients, 269 (11%) were found to have COPD, of which 201 were men and 67 were women. Nearly 161 of these were smokers, the findings revealed. In some medical colleges, one in every six patients screened had COPD and in others, every fourth patient had the disease.""In Jaipur, Rajasthan and Ujjain, every third patient visiting the OPD of the medical colleges as part of the study had COPD, he said. /The screening programme was organised as part of the World COPD Day on November 17.During the five-day programme, every patient visiting the chest department was tested for COPD using a tool comprising a set of eight questions and a peak flow meter test. The ones who screened positive took a spirometry test that was performed by the Breathe Free educator team of Cipla. The treating doctor then examined those found positive on the spirometry. The final diagnosis of COPD was based on spirometry and by the treating doctor in the medical college. Colleges from Maharashtra where patients were screened were Pune-based Bharati Vidyapeeth and Kashibai Navale.Chest Research and Training Private Limited (CREST) director Dr Sundeep Salvi said COPD patients are likely to have very severe Covid-19 when they catch the infection. ""COPD patients, thus, have to be protected from catching Covid-19 with stringent protocols such as hand hygiene, masking, social distancing being very important for such patients,"" he said. COPD is a chronic, progressive lung disease with intermittent periods of exacerbations, called lung attacks, that can often be fatal. ""It is caused by long-term exposure to noxious pollutants that causes damage to the breathing tubes and the gas exchange portion of the lung. Tobacco smoking in any form, household air pollution from burning of biomass fuels for cooking purposes, burning of mosquito coils, long-term exposure to ambient air pollution from motor vehicular exhausts, industry smoke, road dust, and working in dusty workplaces for many years are the risk factors associated with COPD ,"" he said. According to experts, COPD can be diagnosed with the help of a test called spirometry, yet many doctors or hospitals across India do not have this test. Thus, many COPD cases remain undiagnosed or wrongly diagnosed, leading to undertreatment and wrong treatment.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Severe pollution major health risk: Doctors warn against going out,"NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: Going for walks or staying outdoors for a long time amid severe pollution is a major health risk, especially among people suffering from asthma and respiratory ailments, doctors said on the eve of World COPD Day (November 18). Air pollution is one of the main reasons behind chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Dr Rajesh Kumar Gupta, additional director, pulmonology department, Fortis Hospital, Noida, said, ""Air pollution in Delhi-NCR has reached alarming levels in the last few years. Severe conditions generally start before Diwali and last the whole winter. In such a scenario, going for a walk and exercising in open is more harmful than beneficial. /It should be completely avoided.""Doctors also said that there is an urgent need to break the myth about inhalers, which some people report as ""addictive"". Dr Arjun Khanna, senior pulmonologist, Yashoda Hospital, Kaushambi, said, ""COPD patients should not be afraid of using inhalers, thinking that they would get used to it. This is a big social misconception, which mainly children, unmarried women and even highly-educated people believe and then they do not use inhalers. This way, they are increasing the risk of lung damage and recovery is also delayed. Inhalers directly affect the lungs and are more effective and also protect against the side-effects of pills.""With the air quality index hovering in the 'very poor' and 'severe' categories, the number of patients reporting respiratory distress in hospitals has significantly increased in the past few weeks. The number of such patients has more than doubled over the past five years, according to an estimate. ""The number of patients reporting COPD and asthma in our outpatient departments has doubled in the past couple of weeks,"" Dr Gupta said.Yashoda Hospital, Kaushambi, reported a similar situation. ""There has been a 30% increase in COPD patients compared to last year. Many of them need nebulisers and some even need hospitalisation,"" Dr Khanna said. Doctors said that even younger people are now reaching out with complaints of difficulty in breathing, along with cough and cold. Most of them do not even smoke but have been found to have early symptoms of COPD. Earlier, this disease used to occur in people over 45 to 50 years of age but now people in their early 30s are also falling prey to it, doctors added.

"Air quality in major Madhya Pradesh cities poor, Gwalior remains worst","BHOPAL: The air quality of major Madhya Pradesh cities is currently rated as 'poor' as the pollution levels have gone up sharply after clearing of monsoon in the state. Among the four main cities of the state - Bhopal, Indore Gwalior and Jabalpur - the air pollution is maximum in Gwalior, followed by Bhopal. Indore is currently the cleanest among the main cities, but its air quality is still rated as poor, according to data provided by central pollution control board. /The air quality of Gwalior and Bhopal was is just poor, it on the higher side of poor and close to the very poor category. Officials said, pollution levels go up after monsoon. Dust gets heavy in showers and does not fly in the air. The vehicular pollution also goes down during rains and tyres can't lead to flying of pollutants and dust in air, as it settles down on ground. But damaged roads, flying dust from vehicles and increase in construction activities after monsoon leads to sharp increase in the pollution levels.Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, the increase in nitrogen oxide is caused due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage, among others.PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is caused by dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases. Air quality index between 0 and 50 is termed as good with minimal possible health impacts while air quality between 51 and 100 is satisfactory but may lead to minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people. Air quality above 100 is moderate and leads to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. AQI above 200 leads to breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Officials said the air quality remained best during the corona restrictions when the AQI of major MP cities was around 50. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Villages around Nagpur drinking heavy metal-contaminated water due to pollution from Koradi & Khaparkheda power plants: Study,"Nagpur: At a time when India has objected to coal 'phase out' at the recently concluded United Nations meet COP26, an in-depth investigation of the country's two major coal-fired power plants has revealed that villagers living around their periphery are drinking and using highly contaminated water, with toxic elements exceeding the safe limit by 10-15 times.The two power plants found to be a threat for public health are Maharashtra State Power Generation Company's (Mahagenco) Khaparkheda and Koradi thermal power plants. Both the power plants are in Nagpur district.Carried out by Nagpur's Centre for Sustainable Development (CFSD) and Pune's Manthan Adhyayan Kendra, and ASAR Social Impact Advisors Pvt. Ltd, the study found surface and ground waters contaminated with toxic metals like mercury, arsenic, aluminium, lithium and also recorded widespread contamination of air, water and soil due to unscientific disposal and handling of fly ash.The study - 'Polluted Power: How Koradi And Khaperkheda Thermal Power Stations are impacting the environment' - highlighted that the power stations and their ash ponds were discharging effluents directly into local streams and rivers including the Kolar and Kanhan.During the investigations, water samples were collected from 25 locations including surface and groundwater. ""Almost every water sample, in every season including monsoon, failed to pass the standards set for drinking water by the Bureau of Indian Standards, the IS 10500:2012 (acceptable limits) and other relevant standards. /Several water samples and dangerous elements like  mercury which is is among the most toxic substances known to mankind and arsenic that can cause cancers of liver and bladder,"" the study stated.The analysis further found presence of high level of turbidity, hardness, alkalinity, and total dissolved solids (TDS) in both surface and groundwater sources. Apart from this, antimony, aluminium, arsenic, boron, fluoride, iron, manganese, magnesium, mercury, molybdenum, lithium, lead, and selenium were found in dangerous quantities.The biggest concern is that contaminated ground and surface water is being used by local communities extensively, for all purposes including drinking (with and without treatment), domestic use, bathing, washing clothes, fishing, irrigation and for cattle.High levels of aluminium, boron, fluoride magnesium and lead in water used for drinking or domestic use has been known to cause serious health hazards like cancer, respiratory, neurological and cardiovascular disorders, according to inverventional pulmonologist Dr Sameer Arbat. ""Short-term exposure to antimony in drinking water at extremely high concentrations (more than 30 mg/L) can produce nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Molybdenum concentrations in finished water can reach 200 g/litre in regions near molybdenum mining activities,"" he said. Dr Arbat added that as per findings, high molybdenum consumption (10-15 mg/day) is linked to a ""high incidence of gout-like illness, joint aches in the legs and hands, enlargement of the liver, gastrointestinal, liver, and renal diseases, increased blood levels of molybdenum and uric acid, increased xanthine oxidase activity, reduced blood levels of copper, and increased urine copper were all symptoms of the condition"".A questionnaire-based survey, which was also a part of this study, revealed that out of 21 villages surveyed, 18 are being affected due to fly ash depositing in various parts of the village. It also found that airborne fly ash is leading to extensive air pollution. ""We initiated this study together given the long history of pollution due to these power plants and their related infrastructure like ash ponds and the complete failure of official agencies in addressing the problem,"" said Leena Buddhe, director of CFSD and a co-author of the study.Shripad Dharmadhikary, co-author of the study and coordinator of Manthan Adhyayan Kendra, said, ""Till now, air pollution due to the plants had received some attention, but detailed analysis of water pollution was not available. Our study is probably the first such attempt to comprehensively map out the water contamination due to these power plants,"" he said.WHAT THE STUDY FOUND- Villagers living near Koradi and Khaparkheda power plants drinking and using highly contaminated water- Toxic elements exceeding safe limit by 10-15 times- Contaminated water being used by villagers for drinking purpose too, major threat to public health- Doctors warn it can cause severe health ailments- Airborne fly ash is leading to extensive air pollutionRECOMMENDATIONS- Mahagenco must take immediate steps to stop all pollution- MPCB and MoEFCC should take strict and quick action, including suspending the work of the power plant in case pollution persists- A committee of key representatives/sarpanches of the villages in the vicinity, along with representatives of civil society groups and independent experts should be set up to monitor the progress- Mahagenco should also ensure clean-up of places already polluted- Both Koradi and Khaparkheda TPS should ensure strict implementation of all legally binding pollution control laws, including 100% utilisation of fly ash- Until the issue of pollution is fully addressed and clean air, water and soil/land is ensured, there should be no further addition to the pollution load- Installation of new units at Koradi and the new ash pond at Nandgaon should be put on hold For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
$12bn: Burden of pollution on India's healthcare bill,"It's around 11.20 am on a Thursday in October. Like most weekdays the outpatient department (OPD) of Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute (VPCI) in Delhi is swarming with patients. While a panel of doctors continues to examine patients at the OPD, the queue outside grows longer. Waiting for his turn is Sanjeev Negi and his son. /The 36-year-old Ola cab driver was there to see the 'bade doctor' (senior pulmonologist) after his six-year-old son, Pranjal, was referred there by a local physician in Nehru Vihar area. Pranjal is an asthmatic and things get worse for him in October as the air quality starts deteriorating in the national capital.""We have been advised by doctors to instal an air purifier at our home or if possible, shift to a city with better air quality.Negi has to often take leave from work due to his son's health. He has already spent a major part of his savings on doctor's fees, tests and medicines. ""We live hand to mouth. How can I afford an air purifier? I can't shift to another city either. I could have gone back to my village in Uttarakhand but how will I earn?"" he asks. Negi earns anything between Rs 600 and Rs 900 a day after expenses.Left breathlessAir pollution has long-lasting effects on people's health and economic wellbeing in different ways such as lower labour productivity, lower consumer footfall, premature mortality, lower asset productivity, increased health expenses and welfare losses.Pollution-related diseases and deaths have led to additional financial burden on the public in the form of medical expenses and loss of earnings. Based on National Health Accounts data, it is estimated that total healthcare cost in India in 2019 was $103.7 billion. With air pollution responsible for 11.5% of the disease burden in 2019, the healthcare cost for air pollution-related diseases would be around $11.9 billion.The total health expenditure in India is 3.8% of GDP, while the economic loss due to lost output from premature deaths and morbidity attributable to air pollution estimated in this study was 1.36% of GDP.In 2019 around 1.67 million people died in India from pollution-related illnesses, according to medical journal Lancet.About five years ago Prashant Dubey of Kanpur lost his father following a month-long hospitalisation due to chronic bronchitis and severe lung infection. His father, 48 years at time of his death, was the sole earning member of the family.""My father was a carpenter and owned a small shop. Cigarette smoking and air pollution played the deadly combination and aggravated his bronchitis,"" says Dubey.After my father's death, we were in a deep financial crisis as he was the sole earning member in the family.

$12bn: Burden of pollution on India's healthcare bill,"It's around 11.20 am on a Thursday in October. Like most weekdays the outpatient department (OPD) of Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute (VPCI) in Delhi is swarming with patients. While a panel of doctors continues to examine patients at the OPD, the queue outside grows longer. Waiting for his turn is Sanjeev Negi and his son. /The 36-year-old Ola cab driver was there to see the 'bade doctor' (senior pulmonologist) after his six-year-old son, Pranjal, was referred there by a local physician in Nehru Vihar area. Pranjal is an asthmatic and things get worse for him in October as the air quality starts deteriorating in the national capital.""We have been advised by doctors to instal an air purifier at our home or if possible, shift to a city with better air quality.Negi has to often take leave from work due to his son's health. He has already spent a major part of his savings on doctor's fees, tests and medicines. ""We live hand to mouth. How can I afford an air purifier? I can't shift to another city either. I could have gone back to my village in Uttarakhand but how will I earn?"" he asks. Negi earns anything between Rs 600 and Rs 900 a day after expenses.Left breathlessAir pollution has long-lasting effects on people's health and economic wellbeing in different ways such as lower labour productivity, lower consumer footfall, premature mortality, lower asset productivity, increased health expenses and welfare losses.Pollution-related diseases and deaths have led to additional financial burden on the public in the form of medical expenses and loss of earnings. Based on National Health Accounts data, it is estimated that total healthcare cost in India in 2019 was $103.7 billion. With air pollution responsible for 11.5% of the disease burden in 2019, the healthcare cost for air pollution-related diseases would be around $11.9 billion.The total health expenditure in India is 3.8% of GDP, while the economic loss due to lost output from premature deaths and morbidity attributable to air pollution estimated in this study was 1.36% of GDP.In 2019 around 1.67 million people died in India from pollution-related illnesses, according to medical journal Lancet.About five years ago Prashant Dubey of Kanpur lost his father following a month-long hospitalisation due to chronic bronchitis and severe lung infection. His father, 48 years at time of his death, was the sole earning member of the family.""My father was a carpenter and owned a small shop. Cigarette smoking and air pollution played the deadly combination and aggravated his bronchitis,"" says Dubey.After my father's death, we were in a deep financial crisis as he was the sole earning member in the family. We had to borrow money for his treatment. My mother had to sell the house to repay the loans. We moved back to our village, 60 km from Kanpur, he says.""I am asthmatic since birth.

"For first time this season, AQI turns 'poor' across Kolkata, worsens","KOLKATA: The air quality index (AQI) turned 'poor' to 'very poor' across monitoring stations in Kolkata for the first time this season on Monday and continued to worsen, fuelled by calm wind conditions, which hampered the pollutants' dispersal./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/Even during Kali Puja and Diwali, the city's ambient air quality had swung back to 'moderate' after a steep hike.An AQI of 201-300 is in the 'poor' category, while 301-400 indicates 'very poor' conditions.On Monday, the city woke up to a haze, even as a smog hung low, and the air quality deteriorated as the day progressed. According to state pollution control board (WBPCB) scientists, meteorological changes caused calm wind conditions, lowering the dispersal of pollutants in the air. According to central pollution control board guidelines, 'poor' to 'very poor' AQI can cause breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure.Even as Delhi and NCR was gasping for fresh air last week, with the ambient AQI dipping from 'very poor' to 'severe' (401-500) steadily, Kolkata was experiencing 'moderate' AQI, thanks to good flow of air. ""In fact, we minutely monitored crop residue-burning in the districts and kept it under check,"" said a WBPCB officer. Crop residue burning in Punjab and Haryana is often cited as one of the main causes behind the sharper spike of pollution in Delhi.Docs: Poor AQI may lead to a surge of patientsBallygunge station, for instance, recorded 'poor' AQI early in the day, but at 9am, it slid further to 'very poor'. It continued to worsen till 1pm and marginally improved after 3pm, but remained 'very poor' throughout the day. The AQI in other stations also remained 'poor', except that of Rabindra Sarobar, which is located in the most pristine zone of the city. Bidhannagar, which showed 'moderate' air quality in the morning, also slid into the 'poor' category by 9am and since then stayed in that zone.""This slide is ominous,"" said consultant pulmonologist Arup Haldar. ""If the AQI continues to remain poor, there will be a sudden surge of patients with acute breathing distress. Even after this Diwali, we did not see a sudden jump in the number of patients as the air quality remained tolerable, unlike in previous years.""Apart from breathing distress like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the most common diseases caused by air pollution include ischaemic heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and acute lower respiratory infections.Since Kolkata's AQI is driven by PM2.5, the tiniest particles, the danger is graver than we generally assume, said Debasis Basu, a preventive medicine expert.

Track the pollution level in your city,A UK woman vomits over 70 times a day due to a rare disease: All you need to know about this condition,"Leanne Willian from Bolton in the United Kingdom suffers from a rare condition that makes her vomit 70 times a day. The 39-year-old was diagnosed with Gastroparesis in 2008, and ever since, her whole life flipped. Gastroparesis, a condition in which the stomach cannot empty itself naturally, makes the person feel sick, nauseous and in pain. /She had a gastric pacemaker fitted into her abdomen to tackle the issue and stimulate the stomach after eating. Here is all you need to know about the rare condition Leanne is suffering from.What is Gastroparesis?The term Gastroparesis means partial paralysis of the stomach. It is a rare stomach condition that affects 1 in 100000 people. In this disorder, the muscles and nerves do not function normally, slowing the digestion process and making it harder to empty itself. Strong muscular contractions propel food through your digestive tract and when it is paralysed the food stays in the digestive tract causing nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.Causes of GastroparesisWhat leads to this digestive disorder is still unknown, but experts believe that unmanaged blood sugar levels in case of Type 2 diabetes can be a risk factor. Some medications like opioid pain relievers, antidepressants, and high blood pressure and allergy medications, can also slow down the digestion process. In our body, the vagus nerve signals the muscles in the stomach to contract and push food out of the small intestine to the colon. When the nerve is damaged it cannot send the signal, causing food to remain in your stomach longer.Read more: /<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/how-air-pollution-impacts-different-parts-of-the-body/photostory/87847552.cms"">How air pollution impacts different parts of the body</a>/SymptomsGastroparesis has overlapping symptoms like other stomach related issues that often lead to confusion. The most typical symptom of this condition includes: VomitingNauseaAbdominal bloatingAbdominal painFeeling fullAcid refluxChanges in blood sugar levelsLack of appetiteTreatmentDepending on the severity of your condition, the doctor may opt for surgery or just recommend making changes to your diet. People suffering from this condition are advised to eat smaller meals at regular intervals, chew food properly and also eat well-cooked food.

Poor air raises COPD risk in non-smokers,"Lucknow: For the last five years, poor air quality due to high pollution levels has emerged as a major contributor to the rising number of non-smokers contracting respiratory disseases.According to experts, in some cases, it not only leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), but also asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia and lung cancer.With the start of winter season, the city is recording a rise in air pollution levels with the Air Quality Index (AQI) being constantly in poor or very poor category for the last one month. As a result, the footfall of patients with respiratory distress in hospitals has increased.As November is also observed as Lung Cancer Awareness Month, TOI spoke to experts who said though smoking is the biggest contributor to COPD, the proportion of non-smokers with the disease has witnessed a rise of at least 20% in the last five years. Earlier, non-smokers used to be about 5-10% of total COPD patients, but the share has gone up to 25-45%.Director of medical education and head of pulmonary medicine department at Era's Lucknow Medical College and Hospital, Prof Rajendra Prasad, in his paper published in the Indian Journal of Chest Diseases and Allied Sciences in July 2021, has concluded that 25-45% COPD cases comprise of non-smokers and the major reason is indoor and outdoor bad air quality. /The paper is based on several national and international studies published in reputed journals, including the Lancet.""Long-term exposure to smoke generated by various sources like biomass fuel burning, mosquito coils, incense sticks and liquidators, among others, has the potential to cause COPD and other lung diseases. We should minimize activities causing air pollution so that we can save future generations from COPD which accounts for 8 lakh deaths every year in India. It is the second leading cause of death. Now, even youngsters and children are being affected,"" said Prof Prasad.Five years ago, around 400 chronic pulmonary patients used to come to KGMU for treatment every week. The number has now reached 480-500. Similarly, at Balrampur and Civil hospitals, the number of weekly COPD patients has increased from 100 to 125 in five years. Likewise, Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences has recorded a 15% rise from 90 patients five years ago.Prof Darshan Bajaj of KGMU's respiratory department said, ""Analysis of OPD patients shows that nearly 30-40% are non-smokers who got COPD due to outdoor and indoor air pollution. Five years ago, it was 10-15%.""Prof RAS Kushwaha of KGMU's respiratory department said, ""Tiny particulate matter, which causes air pollution, comprises acids, organic chemicals, metals, soil and dust. It wades through the lungs and enters the bloodstream to cause COPD, lung cancer, asthma and other cardiovascular ailments.""Senior pulmonologist, Balrampur Hospital, Dr Anand Gupta said, ""Mixture of solid and liquid that are emitted largely by vehicles (nitrates), power plants, industries (sulfur dioxide) may appear clean as we cannot see these particles, but they all cause lung inflammation.""

"Chandrapur AQI always over 200, life threatening: Experts","Chandrapur: Even if you don't smoke, breathing in unhealthy air of Chandrapur causes the effect of smoking around 10 cigarettes a day, claimed expert pulmonologists and paediatricians in the city. Experts maintained that Air Quality Index (AQI) of Chandrapur remaining constantly above 200 is alarming and life threatening. They were taking part in the Chaupal Charcha (discussion at square) programme held at the'Lungs Billboard' installed at Savarkar Square here on Thursday morning. /NGO Eco-Pro Organisation had invited doctors, environmentalists, social workers and journalists to discuss the issue of high pollution in the city and to come up with solutions. Expressing shock over the high AQI, pulmonologist Dr Saurabh Rajurkar claimed that the severe pollution here is responsible for respiratory disorders and ailments in children as well as adults. ""Nine out of 10 people in Chandrapur have respiratory disorder. High pollution here develops asthma into Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. The problem of interstitial lung disease, which causes difficulty in breathing and oxygen supply to blood, is common among industrial workers here,"" he said and added that even those who don't smoke can develop such disorder due to air pollution.Paediatrician Dr Imran Shivji said that young children here suffer 4-5 asthmatic attack every year. Paediatrician Dr Rafaque Mawani claimed that lungs of children aged between one to five years are more flexible, but the polluted air turns them rigid leading to breathing disorders, chronic cough and asthma.According to Dr Amit Pant, everyone in the city is being exposed to passive smoking, thanks to high pollution. Breathing of unhealthy air not only affects respiratory system, but also have adverse impact on other body parts.A social worker pointed out that Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of United State in its 'AQI guide to Air Quality and Your Health' states that AQI between 201 and 300 is very unhealthy and people with heart and lung diseases, children and older adults should avoid prolonged or heavy exertion in such air.Journalists spoke on reports about pollution while environmentalists listed their efforts and solutions. President of Chamber of Commerce, Sadand Khatri stressed creating a pressure group and educating people about their responsibility to curbing pollution. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
GMDA to set up 42 air purifiers in old Gurgaon,"Gurgaon: The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is planning to install 42 air purifiers across old Gurgaon to tackle increasing air pollution levels. The authority had earlier installed 71 air purifiers at nine locations as part of its 'Air Care' project, which was launched by the chief minister in November last year.""Places with high traffic pressure were selected, where pollution is relatively high. /Vehicular smoke contributes to around 40% of the pollution in Delhi-NCR. Under this project, 71 air purifiers were installed at nine locations and we are planning to install 42 more air purifiers. This time, our focus will be on places in old Gurgaon, such as Civil Lines, railway station, Rezang La Chowk, Basai Chowk and Umang Bharadwaj Chowk, among other key locations,"" GMDA additional CEO Subhash Yadav said.Officials claimed that these air purifiers can reduce pollution by around 40-50% and cover an area of around 500 square metres. Experts, however, said smog towers or air purifiers may not be effective in the open. ""Outdoor air is dynamic. Clean air is lighter and polluted air is denser, so the moment air is released from the purifier, dense air from the surroundings gets mixed with it, hence nullifying the overall impact,"" said Sachin Panwar, an independent air quality expert.""This is nothing but an eyewash. If the government is serious, they should address the source of pollution,"" said Abhishek Srivastava, an environmental engineer. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
#SmogChalRahaHai: Haze and smog steal show from on-field action at Ind-NZ Test in Kanpur,"When cricket fans switched on their TV sets to catch the opening session of the first India-New Zealand Test cricket match on Thursday morning, a few were confused as to why the picture quality was hazy. Even as many checked their TV sets and Wi-Fi connection, they soon realised the haze was not part of the telecast but present on the ground itself. The match is being played at Kanpur's Green Park Stadium and on both the mornings so far, the city and the ground was covered in a thick haze, partly due to the Indian winter and partly due to high air pollution levels in the city.Jokes and memes on the haze galoreThe low visibility on the ground and the hazy telecast became immediate fodder for memes and jokes on the Internet. The hashtag #SmogChalRahaHai was trending on Twitter through the first two days of the Test match with many social media users poking fun at the low visibility. ""Dhuaan dhuaan tha wo samaa,"" quipped former Indian batsman Wasim Jaffer sharing a hazy screengrab of the game, while international cricket writer Rick Eyre joked that the broadcasters had forgotten to take the filters off the lenses of their cameras."
"Muzaffarnagar most polluted city in UP, 2nd with worst AQI in country","Muzaffarnagar: Muzaffarnagar's air quality index reading stood at 423 on Friday evening, making it the most polluted city in UP and the 2nd most polluted city in the country.As per the Central Pollution Control Board's daily AQI bulletin that assessed the air quality of 153 cities all over India, Muzaffarnagar is the only city in the state to have recorded 'severe' levels of air pollution.Blaming it on drop in temperature and wind speed, Muzaffarnagar pollution department claimed that due to change in weather, the air quality deteriorated. Officials said local administration is taking several measures to loosen the smog by sprinkling water on roads and trees, and ensuring a complete ban on the construction activity and factories that emanate smoke."" According to list of the districts published on the board's website on Friday at 4pm, the most polluted city was Siwan in Bihar with an AQI value of 426, followed by Faridabad and Muzaffarnagar (423) and Delhi (406). The board categorises air quality as 'poor' if the AQI value is between 200 and 299; 'very poor' if it is between 300-400; and 'severe' if the reading crosses 400.Also, the AQI value reflects the extent of the presence of PM 2.5 pollutants suspended in the air. /Notably, data from all districts across the country is uploaded on the CPCB's website at 4pm every day and on Saturday, the AQI of Muzaffarnagar was recorded at 309, which still is in the 'poor' category but due to mild wind movement, the air quality was a tad better.According to sources in the pollution department of Muzaffarnagar, on Saturday, around 7 water tankers were pressed into service to sprinkle water on footpaths of the city's road. Shops selling construction material were instructed to cover sand lying in the open, and smog guns were used.According to regional officer, pollution department, Muzaffarnagar, Ankit Singh, ""Three teams have been formed to check pollution levels. A fine of Rs 90 lakh has been imposed on various factories and jaggery units so far."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Patna's air quality remains 'very poor' for 5th day,"PATNA: The air quality in Patna remained 'very poor' for the fifth consecutive day with further deterioration from 342 to 353 in the past 24 hours on Monday. As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report, Patna was among the top 12 most polluted cities in the country. Most of these polluted cities were from Bihar, including Motihari with air quality index (AQI) of 398, Sasaram (390), Siwan (385), Rajgir (360) and Darbhanga (356).The average concentrations of PM (particulate matters) 2.5 and PM 10 stood at 411 in the 'severe' and 385 in the 'very poor' category, respectively. /The overall AQI of Patna was based on the readings of six air monitoring stations at Planetarium (411), BIT-Mesra, Patna (390), Eco Park (380), SK Memorial Hall (359), DRM office-Khagaul (344) and Patna City (233).A 'very poor' AQI essentially means that people may suffer respiratory illness on prolonged exposure to such air and it may have more pronounced effect on people with lung and heart diseases.Naveen Kumar, environment scientist and councillor analyst at Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), told this newspaper on Monday that several contributory factors are behind the air pollution rise in the region. ""During winter season, the AQI level in Patna and neighbouring areas remain high because of low wind speed due to which the pollutant level is trapped in the earth surface. Pollution are more likely to occur under temperature inversion conditions in winter time,"" he said.Senior programme officer of Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED), Ankita Jyoti, said it is high time the state government should implement the climate action plan, which was formulated under the National Clear Air Plan. ""Under this plan for Patna, Gaya and Muzaffarpur, they have already talked about the emergency response action, which we call a graded response action plan,"" she said.""The whole climate action plan has mentioned a set of measures that should be taken if the AQI level reaches a certain level like banning the entry of trucks in the city, stopping the use of diesel sets in commercial establishments and making proper traffic management. The government needs to enforce it strictly as soon as possible,"" she added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
