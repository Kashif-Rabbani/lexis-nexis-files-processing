"As air quality worsens, workers grapple with respiratory ailments","Vijayawada: The burning of toxic waste and fuels in industrial estates has led to a deterioration in air quality in the city in recent times. An increase in the number of industries on the outskirts of the city and unscientific treatment of industrial waste at Jawahar Autonagar and other industrial estates are major factors for the high levels of particulate matter-10 (PM-10) in the city.The Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB), which carried out a study on the reasons behind high PM-10 levels found that furnaces and industries using coal and petroleum coke ('petcoke') as fuel were causing severe damage to air quality.Jawahar Autonagar is the largest industrial estate in Andhra Pradesh, comprising over 6,000 industries, mainly in the automotive and steel molding sectors, which depend on petcoke and coal as fuel for the furnaces. The estate employs around 2.5 lakh people, who work in these polluted and unhygienic conditions.There is no proper coordination between Jawahar Autonagar and the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) when it comes to handling solid waste, with workers alleging that staff of the Industrial Area Local Authority (IALA) can be seen burning toxic industrial waste. /""There is no door-to-door garbage collection in Autonagar. Authorities of the IALA are ignoring public health. The VMC imposes penalties for burning solid waste, while IALA workers burn hazardous industrial waste daily,"" said Bandi Samuel Raj, who runs a tyre retreading company.Meanwhile, severe respiratory disorders have become common in Jawahar Autonagar but the IALA has no action plan yet to handle this. ""The chairman and commissioner of IALA are not bothered about the pollution. The main road connecting Autonagar with Ramavarappadu has become a hub for burning industrial waste. Fumes emitted by burning garbage cause bronchitis and other allergies among residents. Residents of Kanuru, Sanath Nagar and Currency Nagar have been affected due to air pollution from Auto Nagar,"" said KMV Rama Rao, who leads a trade union in the estate.Pulmonologists warn that inhaling toxic fumes will severely damage one's health. ""The smell of rotten eggs is quite common in Autonagar, which is nothing but burning sulphur. Inhaling these fumes will cause respiratory problems in the long run and may increase the chance of cancers and heart diseases,"" said Dr BV Mohana Rao, a pulmonologist.APPCB has said it is preparing long-term as well as short-term plans to handle air pollution. ""We are preparing and implementing local area action plan for pollution hotspots and enforcement of air pollution control measures in all industries, including in unauthorised areas. We will use continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) data for enforcement and legal compliance monitoring,"" said BSS Prasad, APPCB chairman. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease caused by air pollution: Study,"CHANDIGARH: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is predicted to become the third leading cause of death by 2030. Low and middle-income countries shoulder much burden of COPD and it is a major public health problem in India. However, current prevalence pattern of COPD in India is not well understood. The study on COPD in the industrial town of Ludhiana in Punjab, where one of the leading risk factors was found to be air pollution, was conducted by Arun Sharma, Narinder Kumar Saini, Harshita Kelkar of department of community medicine, University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi and Om Prakash Kalra, vice-chancellor of Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma, University of Health Sciences, Rohtak. The outcome of the study which was started in 2011 has been made public recently.Studies carried out in small geographical areas can help to determine the local prevalence and locally existing risk factors of a disease. /In this study, all households were screened in each of the identified colonies using a structured questionnaire for identifying probable cases of COPD based on the Global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease criteria and then confirmed by spirometry. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee for Human Research of the University College of Medical Sciences. ""Residential colonies were identified in an industrial and non-industrial area and all households were screened for COPD using the Global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease criteria and confirmed by spirometry. Information about exposure to possible risk factors was also collected from suspected cases of COPD. Cases were mapped on a digital map of the city and hotspots were identified. As a result, 56 cases of COPD were detected. More than half (71%) were in the industrial area. The overall prevalence rate of COPD in the city was 3.17 per 1000. The highest prevalence (5.6-9.4 per thousand) was observed in the colonies of the industrial area. All surveyed colonies in the non-industrial area showed a low prevalence (0.0 to 0.9 per thousand),"" Dr Sharma told TOI. He further added that spots of COPD were located in the industrial area and there was no such aggregation in the non-industrial area.The study mentioned that smoking and ambient air pollution are major risk factors for COPD. For the purpose of establishing associations, longitudinal studies are required to examine levels of PM2.5, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide with real-time data along with incidence data of COPD. A strength of the present study is that it provides important baseline data as there are no previously published community-based studies showing the prevalence of COPD in Ludhiana.Besides the geographical factors, they also found socio-economic determinants. ""Poor people or workers who lived in an industrial area were living in a polluted environment. Owing to their financial constraints, they most of the time live in poorly ventilated rooms, especially women suffering the most by inhaling the smoke arising from cooking with wood and coal as fuel in these dingy houses. They also lack a good nutritional diet to keep the diseases at bay. These factors further augment the risk of diseases in the population in industrial pockets than those in non-industrial, "" Dr Sharma added.As the poor people find it difficult to bear the treatment expenditure, he recommended that the governments to come forward in extending subsidy benefit for the payment of insurance premium which is likely to go high for the pre-existing diseases, making it difficult for poor people to pay.No insurance scheme to cover healthcare of people suffering from various diseases due to air pollution, barring cancer, "" said Ved Pal, LIC development officer, Chandigarh.

President Ram Nath Kovind addresses joint sitting of Parliament: Full text,"NEW DELHI: President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday said a ""very clear mandate"" for the Narendra Modi government in the Lok Sabha polls was for continuing uninterrupted the development journey that it started in 2014, as he listed the government's achievements and goals.In an hour-long address to the joint sitting of Parliament, Kovind said national security was paramount for the government as he touched on surgical strikes and air strikes on Pakistan-based terror camps. Here is the full text of President Kovind's speech.Honourable Members,1. I am pleased to address the first joint sitting of Parliament after the election of the 17th Lok Sabha, in the year commemorating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. I extend my heartiest congratulations to all newly elected Members of this Lok Sabha.2. More than 61 crore voters of the country set a new record by casting their votes and enhanced the credibility of India's democracy in the world. People have stood in long queues braving extreme heat to cast their votes. This time, as compared to previous elections, more women have cast their votes and their participation has been almost equal to men. /Crores of youth have voted for the first time and played an important role in shaping India's future. All voters deserve to be congratulated for the success of this election.3. I also convey my best wishes to the new Speaker of the Lok Sabha for this new responsibility.4. I congratulate the entire team of the Election Commission for successful completion of the world's largest election. The contribution of employees of several administrative departments and various institutions, as well as the security forces in successful conduct of the electoral process is extremely praiseworthy.5. Nearly half of the MPs in this Lok Sabha have been elected for the first time. The election of 78 women MPs which is the highest number in the history of Lok Sabha, presents the picture of a New India.6. It is a matter of joy that the reflection of India's diversity is visible in this joint sitting. People of every age, hailing from villages and cities, belonging to every profession, are members of both the Houses. Many members are associated with social service, many are from the field of agriculture, from business and economic sphere while other members are from the field of education, medical profession which saves the lives of people and legal profession which provides justice to the people. MPs who have made their mark in the world of cinema, art, literature and culture are also present here. I am confident that your unique experiences will contribute to enriching the discussions in Parliament.Honourable Members,7. The people of the country have given a very clear mandate in this election. After assessing the performance of the Government during the first tenure, the people have given even stronger support for the second term. By doing so, the people of the country have given a mandate for continuing uninterrupted and at an accelerated pace the journey of development which started in 2014.8. All fellow countrymen are familiar with the atmosphere prevailing in the country before 2014. In order to take the country out of a sense of gloom and instability, the people elected a Government with absolute majority after three decades. Giving the highest regard to that mandate, my Government started to march forward without any discrimination with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath- Sabka Vikas', to create a New India.9. on January 31st this year, in this very Central Hall, I had said that my Government from the very first day was dedicated to the goal of improving the lives of all citizens, addressing their problems arising out of mis-governance and providing all basic amenities to the last person standing at the margins of society. 10. During the last five years, the countrymen have come to believe that the Government is always with them, working to improve their lives and to enhance their Ease of Living. Based on this wealth of people's trust, a fresh mandate was sought.11. People of the country have long waited for the basic amenities of life. But now the conditions are changing. My Government wants to make the people conscious, capable, well-provided and unfettered to such an extent that that they do not feel the ""Burden, Force, or Absence"" of the Government in their daily life. Empowering every person in the country is the main goal of my Government.Honourable Members,12. My Government is committed to that very idea of nation-building, the foundation for which was laid in 2014. While fulfilling the basic needs of the countrymen, now the Government is moving forward towards realising their aspirations of building a Strong, Safe, Prosperous and All-inclusive India. This journey is inspired by the basic spirit of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas aur Sabka Vishwas'.This New India's vision is motivated by the noble thoughts of Shri Narayana Guru Kerala's great spiritual figure, social reformer and poet: ""Jaati-Bhedam Mat-Dwesham AdumIlladey Sarvrum Sodar-tvain Vaadunn Matrukasthan Maanit""That is, an ideal place is one where people live like brothers free from the discrimination of caste and religion.13. Three weeks ago, on 30th May, immediately after swearing-in the Government has started working towards building a New India. A New India: - Where equal opportunities to progress are available to every person; - Where life of every person becomes better and their self-esteem is enhanced; - Where brotherhood and harmony bind the people with each other; - Where the foundation built on our ideals and values becomes stronger; and - Where the benefits of development reach every region and the last person standing in the queue.This New India, will move forward towards that ideal state envisioned by Gurudev Rabindra Nath Tagore, where the mind of the people is without fear and the head is held high with self-esteem. In Gurudev's words: ""Chitto Jetha Bhay-Shunno, Uchcho Jetha Shir.""Honourable Members,14. It is a matter of pride for every Indian that when our country completes 75 years of independence in 2022, we would have achieved many national goals for building a New India. To pave the way for the golden future of New India, my Government has resolved:On this path of a New India, the rural India will be strong and urban India will also be empowered;On this path of a New India, the entrepreneurial India will attain new heights and the dreams of young India will also be fulfilled;On this path of a New India, all systems will be transparent and the prestige of honest countrymen will increase further;On this path of a New India, infrastructure for the 21st century will be built and all resources for creation of a powerful India will be mobilised.In the light of these resolutions, in a short period of 21 days, my Government has taken many decisions aimed at the welfare of farmers, soldiers, students, entrepreneurs, women and other sections of society and have also started implementing them. Initiatives have also been taken to enact several new laws.15. A decision has been taken to increase the income support to farmers who are our Annadaata, by extending the coverage under 'Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi', to every farmer in the country. To enable the farmer brothers and sisters who work day and night in their fields to lead a respectable life after attaining the age of 60 years, a 'Pension Scheme' for them has also been approved.16. Livestock is invaluable for farmers. They have to spend a lot of money for treatment of cattle-related diseases. To reduce this expenditure, my Government has also decided to start a special scheme with an allocation of Rs 13,000 crore.17. For the first time, a Government has taken note of the economic security of small shopkeepers. In the very first meeting of the Cabinet, a separate 'Pension Scheme' has been approved for small shopkeepers and retail traders. About 3 crore small shopkeepers in the country will benefit from this scheme.18. We are all indebted to the soldiers who dedicate themselves to protect the countrymen by sacrificing every joy, every pleasure and every festive occasion. It is our duty to secure the future of children of those who guard the border, and ensure peace and security for everyone. Inspired by this sentiment, the amount of scholarship under the 'National Defence Fund' has been increased for the children of our brave soldiers. For the first time, sons and daughters of the State police personnel have also been included in this scholarship.Honourable Members,19. One of the biggest challenges of the 21st century is - the growing water crisis. Over time, the traditional and effective practices of water conservation in our country are disappearing. Houses have come up over ponds and lakes, and the vanishing water sources have accentuated the water crisis for the poor. In view of the growing impact of Climate Change and Global Warming, water crisis is likely to aggravate further. Today, the need of the hour is that the way the country has shown seriousness about 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan', the same seriousness be shown in 'Water Conservation and Management'.20. We must conserve water for our children and future generations. The creation of the new 'Ministry of Jalshakti' is a decisive step in this direction, which will have far-reaching benefits. Through this new Ministry, the systems related to water conservation and management will be made more effective.21. My Government is fully conscious of the crisis in the drought-hit areas and stands by every affected citizen. With the support of State Governments and Sarpanches at the village level, it is being ensured that farmers are assisted and the scarcity of drinking water is tackled.22. Strengthening the system and spirit of Co-operative Federalism, my Government is taking the States along to achieve the national goals. Last week, important developmental issues were discussed with the Chief Ministers and a decision was taken to constitute a Committee of Chief Ministers to look into Structural Reforms in the field of agriculture.Honourable Members,23. Only on the foundation of a strong rural economy, it is possible to build a strong national economy. Our farmers are the pillars of rural economy. All possible efforts are being made by the Central Government to provide adequate assistance to the States for agricultural development.24. Large scale investments have been made to strengthen rural India. In order to enhance agriculture productivity, an investment of Rs. 25 lakh crore will be made in the coming years.25. To double the income of farmers by 2022, several steps have been taken in the last 5 years. Be it the decision to increase the MSP, or approval for 100 percent FDI in food processing; be it completion of the irrigation projects pending for decades or extension of 'Crop Insurance Scheme'; be it the 'Soil Health Card' or 100% Neem coating of urea; my Government has taken many decisions, appreciating such numerous small and big needs of the farmers. The Government has made the agriculture policy both production-centric as well as income-centric.26. An important link in these efforts is 'Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi'. Through this, an amount of more than Rs. 12,000 crore has been disbursed to the farmers in just three months. An estimated expenditure of Rs. 90,000 crore is likely to be incurred annually on this scheme since every farmer has now been brought in its ambit.27. With the provision of storage for farm produce, the economic security of the farmers is strengthened. Now the storage facility will be provided to the farmers near their village through the 'Grameen Bhandaran Yojana'.28. The benefit of cooperatives in the agriculture sector is being availed by the farmers in the dairy business. In other areas of agriculture also, the target is to create 10,000 new 'Farmer Producer Organisations' to benefit the farmers.29. Today, India is second in the world in fish production. Our country has the potential to attain the first place. There is immense potential for increasing the income of farmers through marine fish industry and inland fisheries. That is why the Government is committed to 'Neeli Kranti' which means 'Blue Revolution'. A separate Department has been constituted for integrated development of fisheries. Similarly, a special fund has been created to develop infrastructure related to fishing industry.Honourable Members,30. We can achieve our constitutional objectives only by liberating the poor families of the country from poverty. During the last five years, the schemes implemented in the country for the welfare of farmers, labourers, divyangjan, tribals and women have achieved wide spread success. Only by empowering the poor can they be rescued from the vicious cycle of poverty. That is why the Government has adopted an approach to empower the poor, deprived and weaker sections through provision of housing, healthcare, essential amenities of life, financial inclusion, education, skill and self-employment. This is in harmony with Deen Dayal Upadhyaya's concept of Antyodaya.31. Comprehensive work is underway for the development of112 'Aspirational Districts' in the country. 1 lakh 15 thousand most backward villages of the country are in these districts. With the development of education and healthcare facilities and infrastructure in these villages, there will be a positive impact on the lives of crores of poor families.32. After the success of the world's largest financial inclusion campaign, in the form of 'Jan-Dhan Yojana', my Government is also working to bring the banking services to the doorsteps of the people. In order to ensure that banking services are readily available in every village of the country and in the inaccessible areas of North East, work is being done at a fast pace. About 1.5 lakh post offices in the country are being prepared to provide banking services through 'India Post Payment Bank'. Our goal is to utilise the postman as a mobile bank to bring banking services to every doorstep.Honourable Members,33. Cost of medical treatment pushes the poor families into financial crisis. In order to protect them from this crisis, world's biggest healthcare scheme 'Ayushman Bharat Yojana' has been implemented, providing 'Health-Protection-Cover' to 50 crore poor people. Under this, so far about 26 lakh poor patients have availed treatment in hospitals. In order to provide medicines at affordable rates, 5,300 'Jan Aushadhi Kendras' have also been opened. It is our endeavour to provide medicines at affordable rates to people residing in far-flung areas through these Jan Aushadhi Kendras.34. The objective is to set up about 1.5 lakh 'Health and Wellness Centres' in all rural areas by 2022. So far, about 18,000 such Centres have already been operationalised.35. Our countrymen can learn a lot from tribal communities. Our tribal brothers and sisters live in harmony with the environment and nature and maintain a beautiful balance between development and tradition. In New India, every effort will be made to create an inclusive and sensitive system in the interest of tribal communities. Many schemes have been implemented for all-round development of tribal areas. Work is in progress to provide 'Learning to Earning' facilities to the youth residing in the forest areas. In tribal dominated areas, 'Eklavya Model Residential Schools' are being set up for children. The thrust is on value addition and marketing of forest produce through Van Dhan Kendras.Honourable Members,36. Women Empowerment is one of the top priorities of my Government. Empowerment of women and their effective involvement in society and economy is the touchstone of a developed society. The Government's thinking promotes not only women's development but also women-led development. According the highest priority to women's security, several effective steps have been initiated with the cooperation of the States. Penalties for crimes against women have been made harsher and the new penal provisions are being strictly enforced. The 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' campaign has brought down female foeticide and improved the sex ratio in many districts of the country.37. Rural women are the biggest beneficiaries of freedom from smoke through 'Ujjwala Yojana', vaccination through 'Mission Indradhanush' and free electricity connections under 'Saubhagya' Yojana. Women are also being given priority in the registration of houses built under 'Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana' in the rural areas. Under this scheme, nearly 2 crore new houses will be built in the villages during the next three years.38. Facilities for the women workers in the unorganized sector are also being augmented. Self-employment opportunities are being made available to rural women through 'Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Rashtriya Aajivika Mission. Under the 'Rashtriya Aajivika Mission', loans amounting to more than Rs 2 lakh crore have been disbursed so far to 3 crore women in rural areas.39. My Government is committed to make women equal stakeholders in the country's development and prosperity. Efforts will be made in collaboration with industry and corporate sector to provide better employment opportunities to women. In addition, in Government procurement, priority will be given to those enterprises where women's participation in the workforce is more than the prescribed limit.40. To secure equal rights for every sister and daughter in the country, eradication of social evils like 'Triple Talaq' and 'Nikah-Halala' is imperative. I would urge all the members to cooperate in these efforts to make the lives of our sisters and daughters better and dignified.Honourable Members,41. Our young generation must have a meaningful participation in the building of New India. In the last five years, attempts have been made for developing the skills of the youth, providing them financial support for start-ups and self-employment, and making available adequate number of seats for higher education. The amount of scholarship has also been increased by 25 per cent.42. The Government has made provision of 10 per cent reservation for youth from economically weaker section of the general category. This will enable them to get more opportunities in employment and education.43. To enable the youth of all strata of society to fulfil their dreams, timely provision of financial resources is being emphasised. The impact of 'Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna' has been felt on a big scale. Under this scheme, about 19 crore loans have been disbursed for self-employment. An effort will now be made to cover 30 crore people by expanding this scheme. A facility for entrepreneurs to avail loan up to Rs. 50 lakh without any guarantee will also be introduced. Apart from this, new employment opportunities will be generated through appropriate policies in sectors which have the potential to accelerate the economy.44. Today India has joined the league of countries with most number of start-ups in the world. To improve the start-up ecosystem, the Government is simplifying the rules. This campaign will be further expedited. Our goal is to establish 50,000 start-ups in the country by 2024.45. Research is being encouraged in higher educational institutions. To further strengthen this effort, it is proposed to establish a 'National Research Foundation'. This proposed foundation will work as a bridge between different Departments of the Central Government, science laboratories, higher educational institutions and industrial institutions.46. To enable various higher educational institutions of India to find a place in the top 500 educational institutions of the world, they are being encouraged through grant of autonomy and financial assistance.47. My Government is striving to increase the number of seats in the country's Higher Education System by one-and-a-half times by 2024. With this initiative, 2 crore additional seats would be available for the youth in higher educational institutions.Honourable Members,48. It is our responsibility to provide appropriate opportunities, environment and quality education to enhance the talent of children. In this regard, the 'Pradhan Mantri Innovative Learning Programme' will be started.49. In order to attract children early enough, at the school level, towards technology, suitable infrastructure is being created. Through the 'Atal Innovation Mission', the work of establishing 'Atal Tinkering Labs' in about 9,000 schools across the country, is progressing rapidly. Similarly, 'Atal Incubation Centres' are being set up in 102 universities and other institutions.50. Impressive performance in sports competitions at the world level, enhances the pride of the country as well as increases the interest of children and youth in sports. It also strengthens the culture of according primacy to health in life. To make India a global sports powerhouse, it is important that talented players living in far-flung areas of the country are identified and their selection process is made transparent. To identify the players at the state and district level, it has been decided to widen the 'Khelo-India Programme'. Under this, 2,500 talented players have been selected, and are being trained. Now this facility will be provided to 2,500 new players every year.51. The sports infrastructure in the country will be modernised as well as expanded. A new system is being evolved to make available modern infrastructure and facilities to the players. It is our endeavour that our players win high accolades in the sports world and enhance the prestige of our country.Honourable Members,52. Economic development plays the most vital role in improving the lives of our countrymen. Today India is among the fastest growing economies in the world. Inflation is low, fiscal deficit is under control, foreign exchange reserves are growing and the impact of Make In India is clearly visible.53. India is now on the way to become the world's 5th largest economy in terms of GDP. To maintain the high growth rate, reform process will continue. It is our objective to make India a 5-trillion dollar economy by 2024.54. Work is underway in full earnest to transform India into a Global Manufacturing Hub. Keeping in view Industry 4.0, a New Industrial Policy will be announced shortly. In 'Ease of Doing Business', India has leap-frogged 65 positions during the past 5 years, from a ranking of 142 in 2014 to 77. Now our goal is to be among the top 50 countries of the world. In order to achieve this, process of simplification of rules will be further expedited in collaboration with the States. In this sequence, necessary amendments are also being brought in the Companies Law.55. Taxation regime plays an important role in accelerating economic development. Along with continuous reform, simplification of taxation system is also being emphasised. Exemption to persons earning up to Rs. 5 lakh from payment of income tax is an important step in this direction. 56. Similarly, indirect tax system is also being made simple and effective. With the implementation of GST, the concept of 'One country, One tax, One market' has become a reality. Efforts to further simplify the GST will continue. 57. Keeping in view the interests of small traders, my Government has launched a New Pension Scheme for them. 'National Traders Welfare Board' will be constituted shortly, and 'National Retail Trade Policy' will be formulated to promote retail business. Accident insurance of up to Rs. 10 lakh will also be provided to all traders registered under GST.58. MSME sector provides a strong foundation to the country's economy, and plays a critical role in employment generation. Several steps have been taken to ensure smooth cash flow to enterprises run by small entrepreneurs. In order to ensure that entrepreneurs associated with MSME sector do not face any problem in accessing credit, the credit guarantee coverage is being enhanced to Rs. 1 lakh crore.Honourable Members,59. Good governance reduces corruption, enhances self-respect of the citizens and enables them to optimally utilize their talents and capabilities.60. My Government will make the Zero Tolerance Policy against corruption more comprehensive and effective. The mission to eliminate corruption from public life and Government services will be implemented with greater zeal. Towards this objective, Minimum Government - Maximum Governance will be further emphasised. In addition, use of technology will be maximised to reduce Human Interface. Appointment of Lokpal will also promote transparency.61. The campaign against black money will be taken forward at a faster pace. During the last two years, 4 lakh 25 thousand Company Directors have been disqualified and the registration of 3 lakh 50 thousand suspicious companies has been revoked.62. The 'Fugitive and Economic Offenders Act' has proved effective in controlling fugitive economic offenders. Now we are receiving information in this regard from 146 countries, including Switzerland. Of these, we have concluded agreements with 80 countries for automatic exchange of information. We are now receiving information about all those who have stashed black money abroad.63. The impact of 'Real Estate Regulation Act' or RERA is clearly visible in curbing black money transactions in real estate sector and protecting the interests of the customers; providing huge relief to the middle class families.64. 'Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code' is among the biggest and most impactful economic reforms undertaken in the country. With the coming into force of this Code, banks and other financial institutions have been able to settle directly or indirectly an amount of more than Rs. 3 lakh 50 thousand crore. This Code has also curbed the tendency of wilfully defaulting on loans taken from banks and other financial institutions.65. Under the 'Direct Benefit Transfer', funds from more than400 schemes are being directly credited into the accounts of beneficiaries. During the last five years, Rs. 7 lakh 30 thousand crore have been transferred through DBT. So far, not only has DBT prevented Rs. 1 lakh 41 thousand crore from falling into wrong hands, but it has also enabled deletion of names of about 8 crore ineligible beneficiaries. DBT will be further expanded in the coming days. I would urge the State Governments to use DBT in more and more schemes.Honourable Members,66. Infrastructure will play an important role in ushering in a prosperous India. My Government's continuous endeavour has been to build infrastructure in an eco-friendly manner. Along with concrete, greenery has been made an integral part of the highway and expressway projects. For supply of electricity, optimal utilisation of solar energy is being stressed. Household and industrial wastes are also being used in road construction.67. In the 21st century economy, the pace and spread of urbanization will continue to increase. Development of urban infrastructure in cities and suburbs will pave the way for economic progress and enhance employment opportunities. My Government is tirelessly working for a modern India, by providing world-class infrastructure and public amenities in villages as well as cities. Special emphasis is being accorded to improving connectivity in the North-East, hilly and tribal areas. In addition to increasing the ease of living of citizens in the North-East; tourism, agriculture and other allied sectors will also benefit from better connectivity. Effective steps are being taken to expand organic farming in the North-East.68. Under the 'Bharatmala Project', construction or upgradation of about 35,000 kilometers of National Highways is to be undertaken by 2022. In addition, under the 'Sagarmala Project', a network of good quality roads is being constructed in coastal areas and areas adjoining ports. 69. Along with the highways, Government is also working extensively in the area of Railways, Airways and Inland Waterways. Under the 'UDAN Scheme', air connectivity to smaller towns is being expanded rapidly. 70. Urban transport infrastructure is being created to cater to present and future requirements. While developing infrastructure, attention is also being given to addressing the challenges posed by pollution. My Government is developing a transport system, which is not only fast and safe, but is also environment friendly. For this, special emphasis is given to Public transport. Metro rail network is being expanded rapidly in several cities. The facility of 'One Nation, One Card' has been launched to realize the dream of seamless mobility. Similarly, electric vehicles are being promoted to reduce vehicular pollution. The network of electric charging stations is also being expanded rapidly.71. Modern amenities like gas-grid and I-Ways are being developed at a rapid pace. PNG based domestic fuel and CNG based transportation systems are being developed. In modern India, we are according a special emphasis on production of bio-fuel. Prior to 2014, about 67 crore litres of ethanol was being blended. This year, we have set a target of about 270 crore litres for ethanol blending. Enhancing the use of blended ethanol will not only benefit our farmers but also safeguard the environment. Further, it will reduce import of petroleum products thus saving foreign exchange.Honourable Members,72. My Government is fully devoted to make the flow of Ganga uninterrupted and pollution free. Recently, encouraging evidence of revival of aquatic life at several locations along Ganga have been reported. This year, during the Ardhakumbh in Prayagraj, the cleanliness of Ganga and amenities provided to the devotees have made news throughout the world. My Government has enhanced the dignity and self-esteem of every person who contributed towards the successful organization of Ardhakumbh by honouring them.73. Under the 'Namami Gange' scheme, my Government will further accelerate the campaign for closure of drains releasing effluents in the river Ganga. On the lines of river Ganga, the Government will also endeavour to clean up other rivers such as Kaveri, Periyar, Narmada, Yamuna, Mahanadi and Godavari.74. My Government is making earnest efforts for conservation of forests, wildlife and the environment. In recent years, forest and tree cover has increased by more than 1 per cent. During the last five years, protected areas in the country have also increased. In 2014, the number of protected areas in the country was 692, which has now gone up to 868. To address the challenges posed by air pollution, 'National Clean Air Programme' has been started in 102 cities.75. Solar energy plays an important role in reducing the adverse effects of Climate Change and Global Warming. Proactive efforts of India have resulted in the formation of the International Solar Alliance. Through this organization, India is contributing significantly to the development of solar energy in the developing countries of the world.Honourable Members,76. Space Technology plays a central role in improving the lives of the common man, providing early-warning of impending disasters, identifying location of natural resources, providing signals to various means of communication and ensuring national security. It is the endeavour of my Government to maximize the use of space technology for human welfare. Several facilities such as roads, houses for poor, farming or equipment for fishermen have all been linked to space technology.77. Space technology has helped us in further strengthening our security at land, air and water. Our expertise in accurate weather forecast has improved. This was evidenced during the recent 'Cyclone Phani' that struck the eastern coast of the country. Due to accurate information and timely preparation, large scale destruction to life and property was averted.78. India is marching forward to assume a leadership role in unravelling and comprehending the mysteries of space. Our scientists are involved in the preparations for the launch of 'Chandrayaan-2', which will be India's first spacecraft to reach the Moon. We are also making rapid progress towards achieving the goal of sending the first Indian in India's own 'Gaganyaan' by 2022.79. During the Lok Sabha elections, the country attained another milestone, which however, did not receive as much attention as it should have. With the successful testing of 'Mission Shakti' a new dimension has been added to India's capability in space technology and security-preparedness. For this, today I once again congratulate our scientists and engineers.80. The role of technology in the field of security is expanding continuously. Keeping this in view, work is in progress to establish three joint service agencies for space, cyber and special forces. These collaborative efforts will strengthen the security of the country.Honourable Members,81. New India is rapidly moving towards occupying its rightful place in the world community. Today, India has acquired a new image and our relations with other countries have become stronger. It is a matter of immense pleasure that in 2022, India will host the G-20 Summit.82. The world community enthusiastically supported India's proposal to declare June 21st as 'International Day of Yoga' by the United Nations. At present, several programmes associated with International Day of Yoga are being organized with great enthusiasm in various countries, of which the most important events will be held tomorrow, the 21st June.83. The world community supports India's position on various issues such as climate change, economic and cyber-crime, action against corruption and black money and energy security. Today the whole world stands with India on the issue of terrorism. Designation of Masood Azhar, responsible for dastardly terrorist attacks on our soil, as a global terrorist by United Nations, is a major testimony to this fact.84. My Government's ""Neighborhood First"" policy is an evidence of our approach of according priority to South Asia and countries in the adjoining region. India will play a crucial role in the progress of this region. Accordingly, trade, connectivity and people-to-people contact are being encouraged in this region. The presence of Heads of States and Heads of Governments of 'BIMSTEC' countries, Kyrgyzstan - the current chair of 'Shanghai Cooperation Organisation' and Mauritius during the swearing-in of the new Government is a reflection of this policy.85. My Government is also conscious of protecting the interests of Indians living and working abroad. Today an Indian, if caught in any crisis abroad, is confident of receiving timely help and relief. Several services ranging from passports to visas have been made easy and accessible.86. Due to the efforts of my Government, India's philosophy, culture and achievements have got a distinct recognition at the global stage. This year, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, which is being celebrated world over, will provide a fillip to India's 'Thought Leadership'. Similarly, programmes related to the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev ji, will help spread the light of India's spiritual wisdom throughout the world.Honourable Members,87. New India will be sensitive and also, economically prosperous. But for this to happen, nation's security is of utmost importance. My Government accords top most priority to national security. Therefore, effective steps are being taken to tackle Terrorism and Naxalism.88. India has amply demonstrated both her intent and capabilities, first through surgical strikes and then through air strikes after the Pulwama attack at terrorist hideouts across the border. In future too, all possible steps will be taken to ensure our security.89. Illegal infiltrators pose a major threat to our internal security. This is leading to social imbalance in many parts of the country, as well as putting a huge pressure on limited livelihood opportunities. My Government has decided to implement the process of 'National Register of Citizens' on priority basis in areas affected by infiltration. Security along the border will be further strengthened to prevent infiltration.90. While on the one hand, Government is working to identify the infiltrators, on the other, it is also fully committed to protecting the victims of persecution due to their faith. In this regard, efforts will be made to amend the Citizenship Act while protecting the linguistic, cultural and social identities.91. My Government is making efforts with complete dedication to provide a safe and peaceful environment to the residents of Jammu and Kashmir. The recently concluded peaceful elections to local bodies and to Lok Sabha have bolstered our efforts. My Government is committed to take all necessary steps for the development of Jammu and Kashmir.92. My Government is resolutely working to eradicate the menace of Naxalism from the country. Considerable success has been achieved in this direction during the last 5 years. The area affected by Naxalism is reducing continuously. In the coming years, development projects will be expedited in these areas, which will benefit our tribal brothers and sisters residing there.Honourable Members,93. My Government is rapidly taking forward the work of modernisation of the army and the armed forces. India is going to receive the delivery of first 'Rafale' fighter aircraft and 'Apache' helicopters in the near future.94. Special emphasis is being accorded by the Government to manufacture of modern armaments under 'Make in India'. The policy of indigenously manufacturing weapons such as modern rifles and cannons, tanks and combat aircrafts is being carried forward successfully. 'Defence Corridors' coming up in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu will further strengthen this mission. While fulfilling our security requirements, export of defence equipment is also being encouraged.95. Respect towards soldiers and martyrs enhances self-respect and enthusiasm among the forces, and also strengthens our military capabilities. Hence, all possible efforts are being made to take care of our soldiers and their families. Through 'One Rank One Pension', increased pensionary benefits to ex-service men and expansion of health facilities, efforts are being made to improve their living standards.96. The National War Memorial near India Gate in Delhi, built by my Government, seven decades after India's independence, is a tribute to the martyrs by a grateful nation. Similarly my Government has set up the 'National Police Memorial' in memory of police personnel who were martyred while safeguarding the security of the country.Honourable Members,97. Inspiration from history guides us towards the future path of nation building. It is our duty to preserve the memory of our nation-builders and gratefully remember them. There have been many such efforts during the last five years. 'Dandi Museum' has been built to honour Pujya Bapu and the historic Dandi March. ""Statue of Unity"", the tallest statue in the world, has been built as a mark of our gratitude to the Iron Man, Sardar Patel. 'Kranti Mandir' has been set up at the Red Fort in Delhi, as a tribute to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and other freedom fighters of Azad Hind Fauj. 26 Alipur Road in Delhi, the site of Babasaheb Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar's Mahaparinirvana has been developed as a National Memorial. A museum is also being built in Delhi as a mark of respect to the contributions of all former Prime Ministers of the country.98. My Government, inspired by Sardar Patel, is committed to further strengthen the spirit of 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat'. For this, it is essential to accord importance to National Ambitions and Regional Aspirations. All forms of dialogue and cooperation will be encouraged to achieve this. Guided by the principle of 'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas aur Sabka Vishwas', it is the endeavour of my Government to ensure that no citizen is left behind in India's journey of development.Honourable Members,99. India had to pass through a long period of subjugation. But throughout this period, Indians kept fighting for independence in different parts of the country. The longing for freedom and willingness to make sacrifices to achieve freedom had never waned. This desire for independence culminated into the 'Quit India Movement' in 1942, when the entire nation was determined to achieve independence and even to sacrifice their lives in this cause. Contributing to the freedom struggle was the only thought behind all the actions of our countrymen. We achieved our independence in 1947 on the strength of this collective spirit.100. Today, all of us are again at a juncture of creating history. We are striving to launch a new movement for ushering in a new era. Our resolve today will determine the shape of the India of 2047 when we celebrate the centenary of our independence.101. Today, our country is enriched with the experiences of a 72-year journey since independence. The nation is moving ahead only by learning from these experiences. All of us have to move ahead with the resolve to realise the idea of New India by the year 2022 when we celebrate the 75th anniversary of India's independence. Thus, in the New India in the 75th year of its independence: - Farmers' income will be doubled; - Every poor will have a pucca roof over his head; - Every poor will have access to clean fuel; - Every poor will have electricity connection; - No poor will be compelled to defecate in the open; - Every poor will have access to medical facilities; - Every village in the country will be connected by roads; - River Ganga will flow uninterrupted, and pollution free; - In collaboration with States, India will be close to becoming a $ 5 trillion economy; - We will be progressing towards joining world's three largest economies; - An Indian will unfurl the tri-colour in space, entirely on the strength of indigenous resources; and - We will provide leadership to global development with a new zeal and confidence.Honourable Members,102. If the gap between the public and the Government is reduced, and public partnership is ensured, our countrymen can transform Government schemes and programmes into mass movements. This is the way forward to achieve transformative national goals. Adopting this approach, programmes like the 'Beti-Bachao, Beti-Padhao', and 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' evolved into mass movements. On the strength of people's participation, we will also achieve the objective of a New India.Honourable Members,103. It is the belief of my Government that political parties, States and 130 crore countrymen are all committed to India's integrated and accelerated development. Our vibrant democracy has also matured adequately. During the last few decades, due to frequent elections being held in some part of the country or the other, the pace and continuity of development programmes have been impacted. Our countrymen have demonstrated their wisdom by delivering a clear verdict both at State and National issues. 'One Nation - Simultaneous Elections' is the need of the hour, which would facilitate accelerated development, thereby benefitting our countrymen. With such a system in place, all political parties, according to their respective ideologies, will be able to better utilise their energy towards development and public welfare. Therefore, I urge all Members of Parliament to seriously ponder over this development oriented proposal of 'One Nation - Simultaneous Elections'.Honourable Members,104. This year also marks 70 years of adoption of the Indian Constitution. As a Member of Parliament, all of you have undertaken the oath or affirmation to discharge your duties with true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India. The Constitution is paramount to all of us. The chief architect of our Constitution, BabasahebDr. Bhimrao Ambedkar had said that 'we must hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives'.105. Our Constitution provides guidance for ensuring social, economic and political justice as well as securing liberty and equality for all citizens; and promote fraternity among all, assuring the dignity of the individual.106. I believe that you all Members of the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha, as parliamentarians, will make invaluable contributions in achieving the ideals of the Constitution while discharging your duties. In this way, you will contribute effectively in ushering in a New India.107. All of us will have to accord priority to our duties as public representatives and as citizens of the country. Only then will we be able to inspire countrymen to discharge their duties as citizens.108. My advice to all MPs is that you should always remember the fundamental mantra of Gandhiji. He had said that every decision of ours should be guided by its impact on the poorest and the weakest person in the society. You must also remember the voter who setting aside all his work and overcoming his difficulties went to the polling station to cast his vote and discharge his responsibilities towards the nation. Your priority should be to fulfil his aspirations.109. I urge you all to dedicate yourselves in the task of building a New India and to discharge your duties with utmost sincerity over the next five years. I once again wish the very best to all of you.Jai Hind!(Source: /<a href=""http://pib.gov.in"">http://pib.gov.in</a>/) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Salt Lake residents' protests force civic body to switch to cold mix,"Kolkata: Following complaints from breathing trouble in elderly citizens due to the smoke-belching hot mix generators used for road repair in Salt Lake, the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) is now planning to follow Kolkata Municipal Corporation and use the pollution-free cold mix. ""There have been a few complaints of inconvenience due to the pollution caused by the hot mix machines. We are now working on plans to use the cold mix method of road repair, which is pollution free. /A meeting with a cold-mix bitumen supplying agency has been scheduled in a few days to discuss the matter,"" said a BMC roads department official. The plan to switch over from hot mix to cold mix was made after a few residents in IA Block complained of severe air pollution and the civic authorities had to stop work midway. ""Work was going on the stretch just in front of our house. It was causing a lot of pollution and some residents called me up saying they were having trouble breathing. I informed about the matter to the block committee and local councillor and the work was stopped for some time. But it has started in another stretch in Purbachal,"" said Sudip Sarkar, a 46-year-old resident of IA Block. ""The environmental norms were not followed as the bitumen was melted in the open,"" said Foni Chakraborty, a 74-year-old resident of the area.""Road repair is necessary, but it would be good if the civic authorities can come out with an alternative way so that no pollution occurs,"" said IA Block Committee president Jyotirmoy Raha.KMC has started using the cold mix method on the city thoroughfares after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed the civic body to shut down its hot mix plants.""The hot mix generators cause huge air pollution, which can cause serious health issues for the elderly, specially those with asthma and COPD,"" said Shankha Subhra Chaudhury, a doctor who lives in IA Block. Experts said that in the hot mix method, the bitumen is mixed with an aggregate which is heated for hours before being laid on the road surface. ""The diesel-run generator creates heavy pollution. On the other hand, the cold mix method is environ-ment friendly as the bitumen is semi solid, which is mixed with an aggregate and laid instantly without heating,"" said road construction expert Sandipon Bose.

'We want to create a healthier environment for the next gen',"In a city that's been ranked the most polluted in the world, there's no dearth of startups coming forward with solutions. One of these is Magneto Cleantech, which uses its own filterless technology to make air-purification systems that incorporate existing air-conditioning equipment to provide clean air in large office spaces. ""Our technology works in the same way the earth cleans itself,"" says Himanshu Agarwal, CEO, Magneto Cleantech. /""We are making the air visible and quantifiable."" Diagnosing the problem If a friend or family member wants to relocate to Gurugram, you will definitely ask them to reconsider their decision. We are sitting in a moment and time where all top corporates and upcoming industries are situated in the high-pollution zone. Because of the boom in construction and building material, 60% of the particulate matter is being added to the environment. But, can air pollution be taken care of by the government alone? Only increasing consciousness among people can bring about the change. All of us spend 90% of time indoors but indoors are more polluted than outdoors because of microbial contamination - when one person catches flu in the office, the other employees fall sick too.Choke's on us Since one of the largest contributors to particulate matter is construction activity, irresponsible work must be checked and penalised. (And) there is also uncontrolled usage of gen sets - strict policy implementation and public advocacy are the key to bring awareness. (We must) promote car pools and solar power, and decongest traffic. Unorganised growth and poor master-planning has made it a 'killer' Millennium City, making you smoke more than 50 cigarettes a day - who needs cigarette factories when they are right in your living rooms now! Out of the comfort zone Our product is based on magnetic filterless technology - if you use any other air-purifying medium, you will realise it is the secondary source of infection. Being in the business for 40 years, I realised we have given people comfort but stolen their health unknowingly. So, you can see that you are sitting in a beautiful office but you are not breathing clean air. It is both my personal and company's objective to empower people to live healthier and safer lives by solving the problem through technology. Motivated to act The objective behind initiating a startup and not joining an established company in the air-purifying business is because I wanted to create an impact socially, and think beyond myself. I am not looking at impacting the lives of a few 100 - I want to impact a million lives out there. Actually, the problem of air pollution has just started. So, I want to leave behind a healthier environment for the younger generation. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Side hood suction systems installed in furnaces to make Mandi Gobindgarh pollution free,"PATIALA: To control the air pollution in Mandi Gobindgarh town of Fatehgarh Sahib, the side hood suction system with bag filter house is being installed by the furnaces. Several industrial units have also replaced the coal with piped natural gas in the line of the steps initiated by the district administration under the special plan made to curb the pollution in Mandi Gobindgarh.The pollution checking centers would be connected with the central server system, which would completely eradicate the possibility of issuance of fake certificates. Moreover, special devices would be installed on roads to check the load of the vehicles because over loaded vehicles increase the pollution with the heavy emission of smoke.Fatehgarh Sahib deputy commissioner Prashant Kumar Goyal presided over the meeting of the officials of various departments regarding the assessment of the work done under this plan. /He instructed the officials to speed up the completion of the pending road projects and implementation of all the rules and regulations regarding construction from the pollution point of view. He said that the dtrict action will be taken according to the law against the commuters who will violate the rules and regulations regarding the pollution. He added that the large scale plantation was the need of hour and officials must move towards this direction with full enthusiasm and they must ensure the proper care of the plants.The deputy commissioner said that for the success of any campaign the participation of the people was necessary. So people, especially the youth, must be made aware about the bad effects of the pollution and about the measures required to control this problem. He disclosed that the Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is available in Mandi Gobindgarh so the educational Institutes must be motivated for the use of CNG buses. He said that the administration has also been promoting the E-Rickshaws. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Detox: Myth or Mandate?,"All of us have heard about it, many of us have tried it, and a few of us have gone to extreme lengths to do it. I'm talking about detoxification (detox) and what it means for us - in terms of a nutritional must-do. But must we... detox?/ Is it a myth or a mandate?For starters, your body is already equipped with its own brilliant detoxification process - the liver, which filters whatever enters your body - from food to drugs to alcohol. The liver also ensures the toxins are expelled; it uses enzymes and oxygen to burn the toxins it can, and - for which it can't - combines toxins with amino acids to expel them via bile and urine. At first glance, it may seem that you don't need any external help with detoxification at all. But while this may have been the case earlier on, we are now living in unusual times. Did you know that...-We are exposed to approximately six million pounds of mercury and 2.5 billion pounds of other toxins every year?-Since the Industrial Revolution, 80,000 kinds of toxins have been released into the environment?-A newborn baby has an average of 287 chemicals already present in her umbilical cord at the time of her birth?Common toxins include mercury, lead, pesticides, chemical fertilisers, preservatives, food colourings, air pollution and medication. You'd be surprised at what eating the right food and exercising can do. Help your body eliminate toxins. Here's how... 1. EAT DETOXIFYING FOOD like fruit, vegetables (especially, non-starchy and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, kale and cabbage), good quality protein, good fats as well as sulphur-rich foods like eggs, onions and garlic. Toxins stick to sulphur like glue and get expelled from the body. Also, plant-based foods have phytonutrients - they protect against infection and pests.2. EAT CLEAN and ORGANIC to limit the ingestion of toxic by-products like pesticides.3. DRINK 8-10 glasses of water every day. And one to two cups of GREEN TEA.4. Go to the loo and EXPEL WASTE at least once a day. If you're facing problems with this, try taking natural laxatives like ground flaxseeds or fix your gut issues (but do check with your doctor first).5. EXERCISE for blood and lymph circulation, thereby helping your system eliminate toxins.6. MINIMISE the intake of sugar, which is toxic in nature.7. SWEAT... using saunas, steam baths or just with an active cardio exercise routine. 8. RELAX and MANAGE STRESS. Few realise how toxic stress can be.9. Take SUPPLEMENTS like milk thistle and buffered ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to build toxin-fighting antioxidants, but check with your doctor.Not surprisingly, following a healthy lifestyle is a cure-all for many self-induced medical conditions - from diabetes to obesity to heart disease. The same goes for eliminating your body of toxins and being in the best health you could ever be.Did you know?We are exposed to approximately six million pounds of mercury and 2.5 billion pounds of other toxins every year?by Pooja MakhijaConsulting Nutritionist & Clinical Dietician  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Drop in air quality could stoke breathing issues: Doctors,"Edited. 270 words. To go with 'Let Our City Breathe' logo.Times News NetworkPanaji: Falling air quality levels in some parts of the state could make people living in those areas vulnerable to respiratory diseases. /Doctors say people with pre-existing breathing conditions, such as asthma, are particularly susceptible.In its report for 2018-19 the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) has singled out the state capital and three major towns  Mapusa, Vasco and Mormugao (MPT)  for dwindling air quality. It has found respirable particulate matter (PM) to be beyond the permissible limit in all four areas that together accommodate a population of over three lakh.""If a person is already suffering from a respiratory problem like bronchitis, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, air pollution could aggravate it. Poor air quality could also cause an allergy-like breathing condition,"" city-based doctor Rufino Monteiro, says. The annual limit for levels of PM10 (particulate matter that is 10 microns or less in diameter) is 60 microgram/m3. Mormugao (MPT), however, registered a PM10 count of 117 microgram/m3 between April 2018 and March 2019. Vasco recorded the second-highest level of 87, followed by Panaji with 83 and Mapusa with 67. A source appropriation study is under way in Vasco in view of coal pollution there. It is aimed at quantifying the contribution of emissions from various sources that contribute to air pollution.Prepared as part of the National Air Monitoring Programme, the GSPCB's report for 2018-19 has also found PM2.5 to be moderately high in Panaji, Vasco and Mormugao (MPT). It attributes the cause to vehicular movement, construction activities and industrial emission. ""Data indicates that levels of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are within permissible limits,"" it adds.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"How will you tackle stubble burning, NGT asks states","New Delhi: National Green Tribunal has asked Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh how they intend to tackle the problem of stubble burning - a major contributor to air pollution in Delhi - this year.A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed the three states to file progress reports as well.""The states concerned may also file their respective progress reports, which may include the strategies and action plan proposed to be employed to tackle the problem in the current year,"" NGT said in its order.The direction by the green court came pursuant to news reports on deaths caused in the national capital due to air pollution, with crop burning being one of the reasons for the poor air quality. These include a TOI report titled ""Day after Dussehra, air quality dives, slight haze over city"".The bench said the issue for consideration before it was the remedial action needed to tackle air pollution caused by crop burning.It said that according to news reports, 25-30% of the air pollution in NCR was caused due to crop burning in Punjab, Haryana, UP and Delhi.The tribunal referred to the news reports while hearing a plea by Ganga Lalwani, seeking direction to provide machinery to poor and marginal farmers to avoid crop residue burning.In the proceedings, NGT also referred to a report filed by the agriculture ministry in June this year regarding a central scheme to promote agricultural mechanisation for managing crop residue on site in Punjab, Haryana, UP and Delhi.Under the scheme, subsidy is provided for purchasing requisite machinery.Apart from that, the report mentioned a scheme for hiring such machines as well as exploring maize as an alternative to paddy farming.The other recommendations in the ministry's report included use of crop residue for generating bio-energy, providing crop rotating machinery timely so as to be available during sowing period, preferring shorter duration paddy varieties and strengthening media campaigns against crop burning. /For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air quality sees 100% dip, wait till next week for relief","Gurgaon: Even after the recent rains, air pollution levels in the city shot up by over 100% on Thursday as compared to the previous day. Met officials contributed the rise to an increase in wind speed, which kicked up dust across Gurgaon.The Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 138 ('moderate)' on Wednesday, which increased to 280 ('poor') on Thursday. The AQI on July 10, July 9 and July 8 was recorded at 138, 106 and 95, respectively. /Meanwhile, Delhi fared worse with an AQI of 317 ('very poor'). Faridabad's AQI on Thursday stood at 227, while Noida had an AQI of 388, Greater Noida 373 and Ghaziabad 380.The Met department said air pollution levels have gone up due a sudden rise in the particulate matter, which usually doesn't go up during the monsoon. ""Generally, the air is the cleanest at this time of the year as rains are known to clear the atmosphere. However, the levels of PM10 and PM2.5 have gone up in the city due to dust-laden winds,"" a Met official said.An HSPCB official added: ""Lack of rain and strong winds caused re-suspension of local dust particulates. Also, the wind blowing is a strong surface wind, which has led to an increase in dust and is causing a mild haze. This has led to an increase in the particulate matter. The levels will come down once it rains.""The maximum and minimum temperatures on Thursday remained at 39.4 degrees Celsius and 25.2 degrees Celsius, respectively. Humidity levels oscillated between 57% and 28%.The situation might improve only next week as there is a forecast of rain on Tuesday. The maximum and minimum temperatures are also expected to drop by one to two notches by then. ""For Friday, there is a forecast of partly cloudy sky and dust storms during the day. The temperature is expected to be between 39 and 31 degrees Celsius,"" said the Met official.

PM10 pollution: City among India's worst three,"Ahmedabad: In 2001, Ahmedabad was ranked the fourth most polluted city in the country in air pollution according to the Central Pollution Control Board, which led the Supreme Court to constitute the Bhure Lal committee to oversee pollution mitigation efforts. Almost 18 years later, the city is back on the 'dirty list', this time ranking third in particulate matter pollution, for particles of up to 10 microns in size or PM10. Delhi ranks fifth while, Kanpur ranks seventh in PM10 pollution. These particles, mainly fine dust and smoke particles, are large enough to be trapped in the nose, mouth or throat.Only Dhanbad and Ghaziabad rank above Ahmedabad. The survey was undertaken under the National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP) and the results were placed before the Lok Sabha in the budget session on June 12. The average PM10 levels in Ahmedabad was found to be 236 micrograms per cubic metre. /In case of PM2.5 pollution, particulates that enters the bloodstream through the respiratory system, Ahmedabad is the sixth most polluted. Here, Delhi leads the pack. Three Gujarat cities - Rajkot, Vadodara and Surat - have all shown an increase in particulate pollution. Rajkot ranked ninth in the country in terms of PM10 pollution and seventh in PM2.5 pollution. Vadodara ranks ninth in PM2.5 pollution.When it comes to PM10 and PM2.5, Ahmedabad has registered a constant increase. The average PM10 level was 108 in 2016 and jumped to 236 in 2018, an 118.51% increase. PM2.5 pollution jumped from 34 to 73 between 2016 and 2018, a 114.71% increase. According to the Air Pollution Knowledge Assessments (APnA) city programme, Ahmedabad power plant emissions make up 39% of its particulate matter pollution, followed by road dust (22%). In Surat and Rajkot respectively, the contribution of transportation to PM10 is 30% and 26%, and to PM2.5 is 42% and 40%. The contribution of the industrial sector to PM10 pollution is 12 % and 25%, and to PM2.5 levels is 20% and 36% in these cities, respectively.The minister for environment, forests and climate change Prakash Javadekar, while tabling the data in reply to questions by MPs Chander Kaushik and Hanuman Beniwal, submitted that ambient air quality data for metropolitan cities and million plus urban agglomerations in 2016- 2018 had revealed that SO2 levels were within permissible limits in all 50 cities.However in the case of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx) pollution, mainly from vehicle emissions, 17 cities showed an increase, 16 cities showed a decrease and 16 cities showed fluctuating trends.With respect to PM10, 14 cities showed an increase trend and 14 others showed a decrease. With respect to PM2.5, trends are available for 17 cities of which eight cities showed an increasing trend and four showed decreasing concentrations.As far as Ahmedabad is concerned, in terms of SO2, the city has a constant trend which rose in 2018. For NO2, the city showed an increasing trend in 2016 and 2017 levels remained constant in 2018.Javdekar told the house that a National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) under the central sector ""Control of Pollution Scheme"", has been launched as a time-bound national level strategy. A comprehensive set of directions have been issued under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1986 for implementing measures to mitigate air pollution in major cities.

"Despite protest, hot mix back on Salt Lake roads","Kolkata: Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities resumed repairing roads at IA Block in Salt Lake using hot mix technology, a few weeks after work was stopped following protests from residents, who complained that it was causing air pollution.The residents again complained that the civic workers started road-repair work using the hot mix belching machines from Saturday and that many elderly residents, specially those who are suffering from asthma and COPD, faced inconvenience. ""I suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and had to shut windows and doors of my house and switch on the air purifier machine after smoke engulfed the locality,"" said Shyamal Chandra Baul, an 80-year-old resident.Residents said repair work was very much necessary, but the civic authorities should do it in such a way that it does not cause air pollution. /""The road level is also being raised by another few inches as the tar is being laid on the existing surface,"" said Kaushik Dasgupta, another resident. Locals said repair work with hot mix material was taken up towards the main road on Sunday.Civic authorities said they needed to finish the work under existing tenders. According to them, new tenders for repair work with cold mix technology will be floated after that. ""Work with cold mix technology will be taken up only after new tenders are floated,"" said an official of BMC's road department.Civic authorities said that a fresh Rs 75 crore road-repair scheme for the entire BMC area has been planned and all the councillors have been asked to submit proposals.

Ujjwala LPG scheme pares chest ailment among rural women by 20%: Study,"NEW DELHI: Ujjwala, the Narendra Modi government's flagship social welfare programme providing LPG connection free of cost to poor households, has helped ease chest congestion among rural women by 20%, according to a joint study by Indian Chest Society and Indian Chest Research Foundation.The study, published in the International Journal of Medical and Health Research, an Indian publication, was conducted on 120 females in the 20-50 age group chosen from attendants of patients seeking treatment for chest ailments. It found women using LPG with improved medical parameters pertaining to chest function over those using traditional biomass fuels.Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who has lead the scheme's implementation since May 2016, on Monday described the outcome as ""the most satisfactory part of the scheme"" and said it has also helped bring more than 27% poor above BPL (below poverty line).""Ujjwala scheme has set an example in the direction of making women empowered. It also impacts the environment as well as health and economic condition of the women,"" he told Parliament, adding that nearly nine out of 10 beneficiaries bought a refill. /""Adoption and use of LPG on a sustained basis by a beneficiary involves behavioural change and also depends on several factors, including food and cooking habits, LPG price, availability of free firewood, cow dung etc.""Ujjwala has made it to the Guinness record books as the world's largest direct benefit transfer scheme and currently has more than seven crore beneficiaries. It has a target of reaching eight crore poor households as part of PM Modi's bid to provide energy justice.The study was designed to compare the pulmonary functions in healthy women who had used either biomass or LPG as their sole cooking fuel for at least 10 years. The women were divided in two groups of 60 each on the basis of their cooking fuel - biomass such as dung cake, firewood etc.Biomass fuels accounted for 50% of energy consumption in India in 1989, according to Energy Data Directory and Year book by Delhi-based energy think-tank Teri, but no current estimates are available. The World Health Organisation ranks indoor pollution as the 10th preventable risk factors contributing to the global burden of a disease. Around 1.5- 2 million deaths per year are attributed to indoor air pollution, mainly affecting children under below five years due to acute respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer among women.

Analysis reveals 10 kids under 5 may die annually after 2 units are added to Koradi power plant,"Nagpur: Plans by the state government to build two more units at Koradi Thermal Power Station (KTPS) will cause at least 150 premature deaths annually, including deaths of ten children under five years of age, reveals a latest analysis. This holds true even if the plant comply with the permissible standards of Union environment ministry.The city is already choking under apocalyptic pollution from five coal-fired power plants within a radius of 40 kilometres. Two new units of 660MW each are set to add more toxicity to the air.To assess the damage that the proposed project will cause to human lives, Greenpeace's Clean Air campaigner Sunil Dahiya, who is currently based in Seoul, did a comprehensive analysis exclusively for TOI. The revelations are dangerous.According to it, the estimated number of additional deaths due to addition of 1,320 installed capacity will lead to approximately 150 deaths per year among people exposed to pollution from the plant. KTPS, which is less than 10 kilometres away from city limits, is situated in proximity with a densely populated area having over 10 million people living in a 100km radius of the plant site. /The estimated number also includes ten deaths of children under five years annually.The calculations are done based on 'Cropper et al., 2012' methodology which was published in June 2012. Titled 'The health effects of coal electricity generation in India', the research estimated health damages associated with Sulphur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) emitted from individual power plants in India. ""The number of deaths is calculated on the assumption that the plant will be complying with the new emission standards notified by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change,"" said Dahiya. Explaining the methodology by which the health impact of new units were calculated, Dahiya said, ""The first step was to calculate the emission load from the proposed extra units. This was followed by estimating how much extra pollutants every exposed person will inhale.""Finally on computing the relative risk associated with increase in pollution exposure, the number of deaths due to cardiopulmonary diseases were calculated.While state-run power generation company Mahagenco repeatedly tried to seek waiver for installing flue gas desulphurizes (FGDs), a device that needs to be mandatorily installed to control SO2 emissions, the research stated that ""most deaths attributable to power plants in India are associated with SO2, followed by NOx and PM"". Even as Mahagenco officials claim that the new units will not add to pollution load of Nagpur district, an expert appraisal committee on environmental impact assessment of thermal power plants refused to grants terms of reference (ToR) to the agency for environmental clearance of the two new units. Reason being its failure in following MoEFCC's directives to install FGD in one unit. Mahagenco further claims that the 660MW units use supercritical technology and are ""environmentally more compliant"". However, the high ash content in coal causes high pollution. ""The only solution is to wash coal but due to corruption in washing contracts Mahagenco has dropped this idea,"" sources said.Based on TOI reports, activist Ankita Shah had filed a complaint against the plant to Prime Minister's Office. Following this, a Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) team had done an inspection of Koradi area in June 2017 and found that SO2 concentration was 14 times higher than the prescribed norms. The appraisal committee too has taken note of the report and stressed on need for FGDs. The nitrogen oxide (NOx) level is also far higher than prescribed standards.According to experts, bringing in more units under present circumstances will prove to be perilous for public health. ""Despite having surplus installed coal capacity and huge stranded assets in the country, the plan to come-up with additional units in a region where coal burning is already causing hazard to human health, environment and climate is the worst investment decision, specially by a public authority. They should instead invest this money in renewable energy solutions,"" said Dahiya.Calling it an ""ill- conceived and foolhardy decision"", environment expert Debi Goenka said, ""Not only will the project add to the existing high pollution levels, but it will also be financially non-viable. Assuming that the new units are equipped with FGD and electro static precipitators, there is no guarantee that these will be used or operate at their design capacities.""Clean energy is the only way towards cleaner air. ""Evaluation of the ecological carrying capacity must be necessary before adding another two units of thermal power in a region already suffering from instances of high air pollution due to thermal plants. At a time when renewables can be set up faster, are cost competitive, cleaner and without any negative health impacts, switching to renewable based generation is the logical step,"" said Aarti Khosla, director of Climate Trends. Various national as well as international studies have repeatedly marked Nagpur as one of the top polluted cities in the country. Burning of coal by power plants are the main culprits. Said founder of Green Vigil Kaustav Chatterjee, ""It is apparent that thermal plants are the main contributors towards suspended particulate matter as well as oxides of sulphur. The government is scrapping four old 120MW units and one of 210MW but installing 2 new 660MW units. Thus, the total installed capacity is increasing by 630MW units which will have an additional detrimental impact on environment. The cause of concern are not just the emissions from chimney but also non-point sources. ""The pollution caused particularly during transportation, unloading and storage of coal will be a major issue, along with the age-old problem of fly ash disposal. When the existing units are non-compliant with the provisions of the fly ash notification, where is the question of allowing new units to be built,"" asked Goenka, whose research on power plants in India six years ago had thrown up distressing facts. The two units not just pose a threat to city's air but also water. ""Nagpur is already water stressed, and the new units will require huge quantities of water which is just not available. All new energy projects should be renewable, solar and wind are the best options,"" added Goenka. CALCULATION METHODS1. What analysis revealed?- Analysis reveal emissions from 2 more units at Koradi Thermal Power Station will cause at least 150 premature deaths annually- This includes deaths of ten children under five years of age - Around 10 million people living in a 100km radius of the plant site2. Methodology: - First, the emission load calculated due to extra units. It was assumed that they will be operational at 85% plant load factor and meeting the latest emission standards prescribed by the union environment ministry- The additional quantity of pollutants that every exposed person will inhale was calculated- Based on relative risk with increase in pollution exposure, number of deaths due to cardiopulmonary diseases were found For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
HC to agencies: Why not use drones to spot waterlogged sites for quick action?,"New Delhi: Forewarning Delhi's civic agencies about the impending monsoon and the problem of waterlogging, Delhi high court on Monday listed a series of advice.The court suggested that to tackle traffic snarls better during monsoon, the agencies should consider using drones to easily identify waterlogged sites. This along with a control room would, a bench of Justices G S Sistani and Jyoti Singh suggested, ensure transmission of quick information on traffic jams and waterlogging so that prompt steps could be taken by Delhi Police and the corporations.The court also flagged the anomaly in the capital where some areas get waterlogged while the others face acute water shortage. ""This we say, so that the department can look into this aspect and consider rainwater harvesting near the sites where there is clogging,"" the bench remarked, adding that it wants ""all the departments to cooperate and ensure the citizens are not inconvenienced in the coming monsoon.""The high court directed the AAP government to file a status report before July 24 even as the government informed that it has identified areas that were prone to waterlogging where long and short term measures have been proposed.""We are told that at most sites, water pumps have been installed and on the remaining ones they will be installed shortly. /We are also informed that in the past, the water pumps were not effective as desilting was not complete,"" the court noted, adding that the government was hopeful that the issue will not arise this year as desilting of drains has already been carried out.During the hearing, the court further asked the authorities to ensure the pumps were manned by operators daily during the monsoon, and the moment the water starts to collect, they should be put to use immediately.The court, which took suo motu cognizance of the issue and clubbed it with a PIL, had earlier said that the fallout of waterlogging was not only the loss of man-hours with people reaching late to their destinations, but also the idling engines of vehicular traffic that add to the air pollution in the city.The flooded roads and pavements would lead to spread of water and vector-borne diseases, the court had said and ordered that sewage and stormwater drains be free of any obstruction.

Priyanka Chopra trolled for smoking despite being asthmatic; here are the dangers,"Actress and global icon Priyanka Chopra has been receiving a lot of backlash and criticism online after photos of her smoking cigars post a birthday celebration with her family went viral recently. This has upset a lot of people, health activists, and her fans alike who termed this photo careless and insensitive, considering the fact that she herself revealed last year about suffering from bad asthma since the age of 5.In some photos which went viral, Priyanka, her husband Nick Jonas and her mother can all be seen smoking cigars on the beach. She got brutally trolled on the internet for doing so. Users called her a 'hypocrite' and 'fake', leaving comments like: ""Priyanka Chopra was suffering from Asthma attacks on Festival Diwali... Now she is taking medicine to avoid Asthma. /Hypocrisy at its best ... #PriyankaChopra hate you @priyankachopra""Some also said that while it was her personal decision to choose this lifestyle, it was very unfair and wrong on her part to take a hypocritical stand.For those who don't know, in a bid to spread awareness and promote medical aid, Priyanka, 37, while supporting an ad campaign spoke up about her battle with the difficult and chronic respiratory disease since she was a little child. She also encouraged people to take care of their health using inhalers, citing her own example. She also said that battling asthma hadn't stopped her from leading a normal life. This action of hers was praised by so many people, applauding her for raising awareness.""Those who know me well know that I'm an asthmatic. I mean, what's to hide? I knew that I had to control my asthma before it controlled me. As long as I've got my inhaler, asthma can't stop me from achieving my goals"", Priyanka shared on Twitter. In another attempt to discourage people from bursting crackers during Diwali and raising awareness about the spread of chest infections and respiratory diseases caused by a spike in air pollution, she pleaded people to celebrate the festival with love and not pollution.In a video which she posted online, she can be heard saying,""Please meri saans ko berok rakhiye. Diwali pe patakho ko skip kijiye. (Please spare my lungs and skip the crackers this Diwali)Many fans also took on the opportunity to dig out an old tweet of hers where she says she hates smoking. In one of her replies, Priyanka tweeted, ""Smoking is awful!!! Yuck!!!""What makes smoking so dangerous?While smoking in itself exposes you to a lot of dangers, any kind of smoke (even the passive ones) from cigars, pipes or cigarettes acts as a huge trigger for those suffering from even light forms of asthma. It only adds to the damage. Talking about the same, Dr. Prashant Saxena, Associate Director and Head (Pulmonology and Sleep Medicine) & Associate Director (Critical Care), Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket adds:""Smoking, both active and passive via cigarettes, bidi, hukka, etc is a known risk factor which can trigger asthma attacks in all age groups especially children. Patients who have pre-existing allergic problems or are asthmatics are more prone to develop asthma flare-ups when exposed. Elderly population and children are vulnerable to develop such attacks.""""Smoke aggravates the aviation routes of our body, making them swollen, restricted, and loaded up with sticky bodily fluid called mucus, very similar things that occur during an asthma attack. That is the reason smoking can cause asthma flare-ups (or attacks) to happen all the more frequently. They likewise may be increasingly serious and harder to control, even with drugs"", says Dr Akshay Budhraja, Consultant, Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Aakash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital, Dwarka.What it also does is force the body to produce more mucus than usual, which again can get trapped in the airways and trigger attacks. Adds Dr. Dr. Alpa Dalal, Chest Physician and head of Pulmonary Medicine at Jupiter Hospital, ""It is a well known fact that long term smoking causes chronic bronchitis or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders), but for patients who suffer from Asthma, smoking can lead to frequent Asthma exacerbations, life threatening asthma attacks and they develop COPD much faster than non asthamatic smokers .""

"Soon, 500 e-rickshaws to ply on Patna roads to curb pollution","PATNA: The Patna Smart City Limited (PSCL) has procured 500 e-rickshaws in a bid to curb pollution caused through emission of smoke from petrol-run vehicles. Funds to the tune of Rs 50 lakh have been spent for the purpose.""At present, we are in the process of hiring an agency, which will conduct a survey of the city and identify routes where the e-rickshaws will run. We are also trying to identify beneficiaries for running the e-ricks,"" PSCL pubic relations officer Harshita told this newspaper on Monday.Initially, at least 1,000 e-rickshaws were proposed to be bought, but the number was brought down to 500 to avoid congestion.According to PSCL chief executive D P Tiwari, the e-rickshaws will be allotted to rickshaw pullers for Rs 60,000 each.""The price of an e-rickshaw is Rs 1.6 lakh, out of which Rs 1 lakh will be paid by the PSCL. /The beneficiaries will, therefore, pay less than half of the total amount. We are also in touch with banks that can provide low cost EMIs to the beneficiaries,"" Tiwari said.Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh lauded the PSCL's initiative, saying, ""Autorickshaws are a major source of air pollution in the state, especially in Patna. With battery-operated e-rickshaws, there will be less pollution and improved air quality.""However, Ghosh raised concerns over disposal of batteries that e-rickshaws use. ""The producer should do something about the worn out batteries as Bihar does not have an e-waste recycling facility,"" he said.Patnaites also hailed the initiative of the PSCL. ""E-rickshaws are more comfortable than other modes of public transport. For a collegian like me, who does not own a private vehicle, an e-rick is a boon,"" said Akshat Kumar, a resident of Ashiana-Digha Road.Boring Road resident Shristi Singh claimed e-rickshaw rides were convenient and safe.

"Soon, a database to assess pollution impact on health","PATNA: The state government will soon compile a database of patients suffering from pulmonary and other respiratory disorders and compare them with the air quality index to be able to establish the toll that air pollution is taking on human health.Dr Ragini Mishra, surveillance officer at the state health society, said, ""So far, we do not have any data based on which we can say that a person is suffering from a particular disorder because of air pollution. That will change after this survey is done.""Mishra said a questionnaire being used to compile the database was sent to the Patna Medical College and Hospital, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), Nalanda Medical College and Hospital and All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna in April. ""The questionnaire has been circulated in the paediatric, pulmonary, general medicine and emergency departments of the institutes,"" she said.""The questionnaire seeks details like the patient's family history of diseases, the area he resides in and whether he smokes. /Patients will be sorted on the basis of the ailment they are suffering from - asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic bronchitis, tuberculosis or cardiac problems,"" said Dr Mishra, adding that an app has also been developed and a data operator has been deployed to compile the information.""The questionnaire was given to the four hospitals in April and 95 cases of respiratory illnesses were received till July 8, of which 44 were from Patna. The state health society is, however, waiting for more data,"" she said.According to the World Health Organization, nine out of ten people breathe polluted air, which kills seven million people across the globe every year. Speaking to TOI, state pollution control board chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh said a 2017 study done by a group of students under his guidance revealed that 50% of traffic cops in Patna suffered from some kind of respiratory problem. ""Those working in the open have a 40-45% higher chance of suffering from a lung-related disease than those working indoors and in air-conditioned offices,"" he said. Dr Manish Shankar, associate professor at the TB and chest department of IGIMS, said treatment for respiratory diseases is a long and expensive process. ""Asthma and COPD require life-long treatment, which costs Rs 1,000-Rs 1,500 a month. Air pollution can also cause lung cancer, which is mostly diagnosed in the final stage. Treatment for lung cancer can cost around Rs 30,000 per month,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
State steps on it to enforce green checks to help city breathe easy,"PATNA: An international air quality survey published earlier this year ranked Patna as the seventh most polluted city in the world and the sixth in India. Waking up to this alarming health challenge, the state government has drawn up an action plan to curb pollution in the city.The focus will be on curbing suspended particulate matter less than 2.5 micron (PM 2.5), which is the deadliest and the biggest contributor to air pollution in Patna. In the past 48 hours, the city saw the PM 2.5 reach 156 micrograms per cubic metre, which is more than double the safe limit of 60 g/m3.Dipak Kumar Singh, principal secretary, department of environment, forest and climate change, cited several factors are responsible for the increasing pollution levels in the city. ""The action plan for control of air-pollution proposes several measures to curb pollutants from various sources, such as vehicles, construction sites, road dust, industries and garbage fire,"" Singh said.Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the department is conducting smoke meter test at two locations in the city to curb the movement of vehicles which are not fit. /According to data provided by the department, 2,545 vehicles were fined from April, to date during pollution checks. About Rs 25.45 lakh fine has been collected by the department.Among the measures to be enforced are refusing permits to diesel-operated auto rickshaws, ban on cutting of trees for road construction and mandatory covering of construction sites among others. The Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) had laid out the measures in May, 2018.Singh held a meeting on Wednesday to review the steps being taken for implementation of the action plan to control air-pollution in Patna. He instructed the traffic police to ensure trucks and vans carrying construction materials are covered. He also asked Patna Municipal Corporation commissioner Anupam Kumar Suman to put a blanket ban of burning of solid waste and take necessary action against violators. Singh also directed civic officials concerned to sprinkle water on the roads to prevent dust particles.The road construction department officials were asked to create concrete pavements while the district agriculture officials were directed to stop farmers from burning crop stubble.""Different agencies are working as per their roles envisaged by the action plan for control of air-pollution. Incidentally, the level of PM 2.5 measured comparatively low this year. Steps are being taken to ensure that the air-pollution remains under permissible level, including notices to government as well as private entities for not covering construction sites and restricting permits for diesel- run auto- rickshaws among others,"" Dipal told TOI on Thursday.Pollution experts, however, claimed that there should be more emphasis on timely implementation of various provisions of the action plan on air pollution. ""Creating awareness about hazards of air-pollution is more important. The state government should promote vertical garden, so that, people would follow this at their homes. A vertical garden should be set up under the bridges like it has been done in Delhi,"" said Pradhan Parth Sarthi, associate professor at department of environmental science of Central University of South Bihar.He added that the emission from automobiles is more lethal to human health, so government should be more focused on restricting the vehicles. ""Human-made pollutants during monsoon season impact the rainfall. The onset of winter season leads to poor air quality as the pollutants get trapped in lower layer of troposphere, which is 2km above the earth crust. The pollutants do not disperse and remain suspended in the atmosphere, causing smog. It eventually affects the people's lungs,"" he said.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Warming earth makes for changes in the high Himalayas,"CHANDIGARH: Shepherd Raja Hiyunari lost 250 sheep after they followed each other off a steep cliff in the Chokhang area of Lahaul Forest Division months ago, while he was leading his herd from Udaipur to Keylong, at an altitude of over 33,340 feet in the high range Himalayas. The sheep had spotted a snow leopard and taken fright.""Going by their natural instinct, they followed each other off the cliff in panic. All of them died,"" he says. Hiyunari is hopeful the state government will compensate the loss. He has applied for compensation, and the state has a policy of offering compensation for loss sustained on account of wildlife. /He is entitled to Rs 3000 for each of his sheep.Not all shepherds losing sheep apply for compensation. ""It is a cumbersome procedure, and reports are sought from the gram pradhan ,a doctor and the forest department,"" he says, adding that most shepherds just think of such loss as preordained. However, with four children to feed, he needed to find a way to tide over the massive financial loss.Human-wildlife conflict is on the rise across Lahaul-Spiti, Pangi and Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh. Senior forest guard Shiv Kumar at Udaipur range in Lahaul Forest Division, who shot to brief fame with his photographs of two snow leopards and a carcass of one leopard, said, ""In my tenure of nine years at Udaipur range, it was the first time that I captured two snow leopards on my camera. The carcass became visible when vultures were found nibbling at it. The snow leopard is suspected to have died under the avalanches. It was found under a melting glacier.""Three years ago, after tracing pug marks of a snow leopard, he got camera traps installed. ""I have captured the same individual for the past three years in my camera trap images around the same area,"" he says.The snow leopard lives in the high rugged terrain between 9800 to 17000 feet in Himachal, and is found in the region of the Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary in Lahaul and Spiti to Pangi in Chamba district and Lippa Asrang in tribal Kinnaur district. The state wildlife department estimates that there are about 80to 100 snow leopards in the region.Shiv Kumar is also surprised by the frequency with which brown bear are sighted in the region. ""A boy returning home in a nearby village was injured by a brown bear. In October, when the apple orchards are full of fruit, brown bears come and pluck whole branches to eat to their fill before going off into hibernation for winter. People now have taken to cash crops and vegetables and brown bear has started ravaging fields to enjoy the juicy carrots,"" Kumar said.The International Union for Conservation of Nature has advocated measures to conserve the population of snow leopard and brown bear, both of which are in decline. Salvador Lyngdoh, scientist with Dehradun based Wildlife Institute of India, said, ""Snow leopard is the icon species, the indicator of good climate in the high altitude Himalayan eco system. The only way to ensure its conservation is maintenance of a good prey base and suitable habitat. Unfortunately this top predator is facing survival threat because of degrading habitat ,declining prey base and impact of climate change all across its habitation in Himachal Pradesh, North Sikkim , Ladakh in J& K and Gangotri in Uttarakhand.""He explained that one major reason for habitat degradation is rampant grazing by nomadic herders, which sets off competition between herbivores like blue sheep, ibex, Himalayan Thar, and livestock for food.""Ungulates are prey base for predators like snow leopards. Reduced availability of natural prey will aggravate human wildlife conflict as the predators and omnivores like bear will then feed on livestock,"" he said, adding that from the ecological point of view , a focus on snow leopard will ensure that all allied species are protected .The local nomads too represent a repository of knowledge on the local ecology. Forty-seven year-old Mangni of the Gaddi nomadic community, settled on either side of the Dhauladhar Range in the Kangra and Chamba valleys of Himachal Pradesh, talks of the increased glacial melt. ""I have grown up taking my herd around the glacier at Jhalma between Miyar and Keylong. Earlier it would melt around July end. In the last few years, it began melting early. This year it was gone in June itself,"" he said.In a recent study, the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) reported that the Hindu Kush region of the Himalayas could lose two-thirds of its glaciers by 2100 if global efforts to control warming fail. This would also mean the 'ghost of the mountains', as the snow leopard is called, could vanish. And not just the snow leopard, even critical water supplies for hundreds of millions of people would be gone.The high altitude habitat of the snow leopard spans many of Asia's major watersheds. Over 330 million people are dependent on rivers originating in snow leopard territory. There is not much information available about snow leopards, which have small population in many inaccessible high regions of Himalaya, making them especially vulnerable.Experts believe biodiversity is one answer to the impact of climate change, and could partially mitigate the damage. ""Healthy mountain grassland ecosystems prevent loss of the thin fertile soil layer on mountain slopes and helps prevent destructive floods and landslides. It plays a pivotal role in ground water recharge. That is why it is important that the state government facilitates alternatives livelihoods for nomads,"" scientist Lyngdoh said.The top predators in the pyramid control and regulate the entire ecosystem, he explained, controlling control excessive grazing by keeping the population of herbivores they prey on in check. ""There are inter-linkages with regard to carrying capacity of vegetation and wild creatures. If this ecological balance is disturbed, nature might achieve a new balance, but it might adversely impact human beings. So looking at everything from anthropogenic point of view, we are all are focusing on conservation of habitat. The rate of man-induced extinction is much faster now than the natural rate,"" he said. The state government is alert to the need for conservation of snow leopard habitat. Principal chief conservator of Forests, (wildlife) of the state, Dr Savita said, ""A new project, 'Securing Livelihoods, Conservation, Sustainable Use and Restoration of High Range Himalayan Ecosystem (SECURE)' is being implemented in four states including Himachal Pradesh, for a period of six years. It primarily focuses on conservation of snow leopard and other endangered species and securing livelihood of people for sustainable forest managmenet in alpine pastures. We expect this will resolve human-wildlife conflict and reduce wildlife crime to some extent.""Local communities are being given training in floriculture, horticulture, cultivation of high yielding and economical crops, she said, to prevent excessive grazing.Manoj Thakur, state project officer of United Nations Development Programme said the limited forest staff could not be expected to mange far flung areas, so the local community will be trained and paid incentives to be part of forest activities, aiding in wildlife population estimation and helping to curb poaching. Incentives for these too will come from the SECURE project, he said.Scientist Lyngdoh added that the participation of local people would aid in prevention of revenge killing of wild animals, especially. It would also go some way in preventing transmission of disease in wildlife.The Himalayan wolf is found in Northern India in the Ladakh region and Lahual and Spiti region in the north eastern part of Himachal Pradesh. The wolf population was last estimated in 1995 at 350 individuals. Lyndon explained, ""Some local groups in Spiti and other habitat areas in Himachal dig broad ditches to trap wolves, another top predator of the high altitude of Himalaya. Once trapped, the animal is killed with bricks and stones. This is their way to diminish the wolf population and take revenge on these animals for feeding on their livestock. The killers of animals even collect money from villagers as reward, setting a dangerous precedent.""Diseases could spread if the wild wolf begins to mate with dogs and hybridization occurs, he said. ""The transmission of disease may affect the whole population of wolf and other related species and result in total wipe out,"" the scientist said.Excessive tourism and waste generation also contribute to habitat degradation. The boom in tourism increases air pollution and increases the garbage generated with the mushrooming hotel industry. ""The government must control the number of tourists in fragile high altitude places, as was done in the case of Rohtang Pass .Eco-tourism and adventure activities like trekking could be promoted so locals benefit, and visitors too can be involved in forest and wildlife conservation,"" Lyngdoh said.The state government is already making efforts in this direction. ""The government has come up with a waste management model for Keylong region, where door to door garbage collection will be done. Collection of around one to 1.5 tonnes of waste is expected, of which organic waste will used for bio-composting. A machine will be used to compress plastic bottles so they can be transported for recycling,"" Thakur informed. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Breathless in city: Pollution up by thrice the acceptable limit,"Hyderabad: Hyderabad has recorded extremely high air pollution levels between December 2018 and May 2019, said city doctors and warned that this could lead to lung and breast cancer. They said that these variations were clearly noted in the city where the PM 2.5 levels spiked in October and then remained constant till December. /The average Air Quality Index (AQI) in the city this summer ranged from 150-230.The data was compiled by the Lung Care Foundation from the Air Quality Index China and the Central Pollution Control Board websites. According to their observation, the PM 2.5 level during this summer was alarmingly more than 3 times the acceptable limits recommended by WHO. Speaking at the launch of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh chapter of 'Doctors of Clean Air', on Sunday, S K Joshi, chief secretary, government of Telangana, said that understanding the impact of air pollution is the first step in keeping our air safe. He added that while pollution levels in Hyderabad are spoken about in ample, the increasing levels of air pollution in other districts like Kothur, Sangareddy, and Medak, is also a major concern. The doctors added that while the air quality drastically improved in the last two months due to rains, the situation might deteriorate as soon the monsoon ends.  ""Many toxic air pollutants pass through the blood stream of a child in the mother's womb causing congenital diseases, brain damage, autism and low birth weight,"" Dr P Raghu Ram, president, the Association of Surgeons of India, said.

28-year-old non-smoker Delhi woman diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer due to air pollution,"The air pollution level in the national capital had reached a choking height with an average yearly PM 2.5 concentration at 113.5 micrograms per cubic meter in the year 2018. There is no denying that exposure to smog can be incredibly harmful to our health in a lot of ways. It can not only cause asthma, COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) and allergies but may also aggravate existing respiratory illness. However, did you know that this deadly air pollution can also cause lung cancer?/ A 28-year-old woman has been diagnosed with stage-4 lung cancer in the country capital recently. Here is the worst part, the woman is a non-smoker. According to doctors of the Ganga Ram Hospital, it could be the toxic air and high-level of air pollutants in the city which caused the stage 4 cancer in the woman, who is a resident of Ghazipur town. The air quality index of this area, as of today, is poor which means if you suffer from respiratory issues, you might be advised to reduce prolonged outdoors exposure and exertion. While the doctors were taken aback with the case, they also noticed that it was not the first such case which has been reported amongst people in their 20s. What do the doctors say?  Dr Arvind Kumar, chest surgeon at the Ganga Ram Hospital spoke to ANI and said, ""I suspect the reason behind it is polluted and toxic air in Delhi. Polluted air also contains elements found in cigarettes. It isn't an isolated case.""He further added, ""I have reported such cases earlier too. On average, I have seen 2-3 lung cancer cases every month in non-smoking individuals in their early 30s. But this is the first case in the 20s.""What is lung cancer? Lung cancer is the type of cancer which starts in the lungs. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for around 80 to 85 per cent of lung cancer cases. Other types of lung cancer include small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. The NSCLC is further divided into various subtypes: 1. Adenocarcinoma2. Squamous cell cancer3. Large cell carcinoma4. Undifferentiated non small cell lung cancerWhat causes lung cancer? While smoking undoubtedly remains the major cause behind this fatal disease (causing over 90 per cent of lung cancer cases), it is important to understand that anyone can get lung cancer if they inhale toxic substances. Even if you are a non-smoker, passive smoking (second-hand smoking), exposure to radioactive gases (radon), hazardous chemicals and particle pollution can increase the risk of lung cancer.How can you safeguard yourself from Delhi's toxic air? Living and breathing in one of the world's most polluted city is a battle in itself. While it definitely requires strict and fast-paced actions from the government authorities to tackle this massive public health issue, here are certain things one must keep in mind: 1. Check the air pollution levels before heading out 2. Avoid going to the areas with high traffic levels 3. Avoid working out outdoors during high air pollution levels 4.

"Soon, electric buses to run on Patna roads","PATNA: In a bid to reduce air pollution, the state transport department is planning to procure at least 20 electric buses under Phase II of the FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles) scheme of the Centre.The scheme aims to promote the use of electric vehicles in the country.Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal told this newspaper on Thursday that a proposal in this regard had been sent to the Centre. Under the FAME scheme, the Union government would sanction 60% of the amount required for buying electric buses and the remaining 40% would be borne by the state government.""The state government has already launched electric cars. While booking for two-wheelers has started, electric buses will start plying on city roads by December-end,"" Agarwal said, adding such buses were costlier than those running on compressed natural gas and petrol.However, some Indian automobile dealers have started manufacturing electric buses, which once charged, can cover a distance of 150km. /Also, they do not emit harmful smoke.""A team of transport department officials has been sent to Kolkata and Mumbai to study the feasibility of electric buses. The state government will also come up with an electric vehicle policy soon,"" the transport secretary told this newspaper.CNG kits to be installed in 15 buses: The transport department is planning to convert some city buses into CNG-propelled ones. Bidding process for retrofitting of CNG kits has already been initiated.""We have selected 15 city buses for installing CNG kits on a trial basis,"" Agarwal said.CNG is a cheaper and cleaner fuel, which gives vehicles better mileage than petrol or diesel. It can also save up to 50% money compared to petrol or diesel and its maintenance cost is low. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Many violations in Koradi plant: Activists tell central committee,"Nagpur: While the utilization of fly-ash emitted from Koradi Thermal Power Station (KTPS) is virtually zero, the toxic and radio-active substance is being used in agriculture and filling of low-lying areas even though it is prohibited.This and more such violations were brought to the notice of the six-member committee which inspected the coal-fired power plant on Thursday afternoon.As reported by TOI earlier, the Union environment ministry refused to initiate the process for granting environmental clearance to the proposed two 660 megawatt new units of the plant. As per ministry's report, the sulphur dioxide emissions from the plant are 7-14 times more than the permissible standards.Mahagenco had applied for the grant of 'terms of reference' (TOR) for environmental clearance which is the first step for getting the nod from Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC). However, the expert appraisal committee on environmental impact assessment of thermal power projects had deferred the TOR until a six-member sub-committee submits an inspection report.Headed by former chairman of Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board Narmada Prasad Shukla, the committee reportedly inspected the four operational units and proposed site for the two new units. ""The members had a meeting with Mahagenco officials in which the latter gave presentation of availability of coal and water for the new units, its plans to reduce emissions levels and creating ash bund,"" insiders told TOI. /TOI tried to contact some of the members of the sub-committee but could not get in touch with them. The committee is staying back on Friday for another round of inspection.This is the second time that a committee has inspected KTPS. Earlier in June 2017, a four-member committee of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) from Vadodara monitored pollution levels from the plant, following the directives of Prime Minister's Office (PMO). Based on TOI reports, activist Ankita Shah had filed complaint with the PMO. The CPCB team had corroborated TOI's report on high air pollution from the plant.Prior to the inspection, a group of environment and social activists met the committee members, apprising them about the damage being caused to public health and environment due to the power plant. In a memorandum submitted to Shukla, city-based organization Vidarbha Connect, one of the 35 organizations which has kick-started an agitation against the new units, highlighted numerous violations at KTPS. ""Air, water and soil pollution from the radioactive and toxic fly-ash has resulted in various diseases like asthma, bronchitis, cardiovascular, cancer and even pre-mature deaths,"" it stated. On July 15, TOI reported on the analysis done by experts from Greenpeace which revealed that the two new units will cause at least 150 pre-mature deaths annually, including deaths of ten children under five years of age.The activists further informed the committee that the emissions of toxic pollutants from the plant were much higher than the permissible standards. ""Emissions of mercury are not monitored at all. Moreover, continuous monitoring instruments for stack and ambient air are not calliberated, leading to inaccurate results,"" they stated.Stating that huge quantity of water meant for irrigation is being diverted for power generation, the activists added, ""Mahagenco is using water of Nag River after filtration at Bhandewadi. Using filtered river water under the garb of treated sewage is against the norms.""WHAT COMPLAINTS SAY- Emissions from KTPS much higher than permissible limits- Mercury emissions not monitored- Flue gas desulfurization (FGD) plant to control SO2 emissions not installed in existing units- Fly-ash utilization virtually zero- Ash pond is not lined with high-density polyethylene, causing groundwater pollution in nearby villages- Toxic and radioactive fly-ash used in agriculture- Mandatory green belt around the plant and ash pond does not exist- Six-month reports on the compliance status of stipulated conditions of environmental clearance not being regularly submitted to concerned agencies- Status of compliance including results of monitored data not uploaded on plant's website despite being compulsory- No mechanism for an inbuilt continuos monitoring for radio-activity and heavy metals in coal and fly ash- Fugitive emissions are not controlled to prevent impact on agricultural land- CSR funds diverted for other works- More than 50,000 tonnes of fly ash per day generated in the region which is stored unscientifically in ponds - Filtered water from Nag river being used for power generation under the garb of treated sewage- Pollution from plant leading to various health ailments- Solar energy potential of the state not being explored- Rooftop solar discourage by power distribution companies- No power plant being set-up in western Maharashtra due to strong opposition by locals- Nagpur bearing the brunt, 2 new proposed units replacement of Mahagenco's generating units in Nashik, Paras and Chandrapur For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Mumbai air's toxicity worst in Maharashtra, Bandra and Sion are choking: Study","Mumbai's air is the most toxic in the state with highest concentration of major pollutants-oxides of nitrogen (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide, reveals latest scientific analysis. Mumbai is also facing increasing air pollution due to unplanned development and vehicular emissions, according to 'The Air Quality Status of Maharashtra' (2018-19) prepared by the New Delhi-based The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) for the state's pollution watchdog, MPCB./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/Data analysis from 72 air quality monitoring stations in the state shows that levels of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in Bandra and Sion are nearly twice the permissible limit of 60 micrograms per cubic meter (mpcm) set by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Data also shows that from 106 mpcm in 2017-18, concentration of RSPM in Bandra rose to 111mpcm in 2018-19. Its level saw a rise of 1 mpcm in a year at Sion which recorded an annual average of 147 mpcm in 2018-19. Sion is the second most polluted in the state in terms of RSPM levels.Overall, only four of 72 monitoring stations in the state recorded RSPM levels within safety limits. ""RSPM is a major cause of concern as particles can get deep into lungs, leading to pre-mature death, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases,"" the report says.As for deadly pollutant NOx, that can dip lung function, reduced oxygenation of body tissues and other health ailments, Sion and Bandra are the worst hit in the state. Both have recorded an annual NOx average of 83 and 66 mpcm respectively-almost twice the permissible limit.In 2017-18, Bandra's NOx levels were 47 mpcm and the upsurge has ""made it a prominent region for NOx pollution"". But its in Kalyan, Dombivli, Ambernath and Pune has dipped compared to last year. Navi Mumbai and two stations of Thane also surpassed the safety limit.Of 12 regions in the state which recorded NOx concentrations, six including Mumbai, Kalyan, Navi Mumbai and Thane failed to meet prescribed norms. Mumbai was the worst with an annual average of 75 mpcm.Carbon monoxide pollution was prominent in Bandra. While SO2 levels in the state were within safe limit, the highest were recorded in Navi Mumbai.Sunil Dahiya, clean air analyst at Greenpeace East Asia said, ""Aggressive investments and shift towards public transportation, adoption of electric vehicles... can help people in Maharashtra breathe cleaner air, save lives and reduce losses to GDP.""

Track the pollution level in your city,Battle against air-pollution begins with food vendors,"Kolkata: The city is gearing up to battle air pollution this winter. As the battle lines are drawn, the civic body is set to replace the coal-fired oven of food vendors with electric induction oven. Food vendors, according to the source-apportionment study by National Environment and Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), are one of the biggest sources of the city's air pollution. /Besides, sprinklers and mechanical sweepers are also being purchased to take on dust pollution.Recently, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) commissioner had asked for Rs 2,371.2 lakh from the principal secretary of environment department under the implementation plan for improvement of air quality in Kolkata. The plan included replacement of coal-fired oven (open chullahs) with electric induction oven, installation of fogging/mist machines at select traffic intersections and road stretches to suppress haze especially during winter and procurement of mechanical sweepers and road washers to reduce road dust, the letter from the civic commissioner to the principal secretary, environment department, revealed.The cost quoted in the letter is only 50% of the total cost of the scheme. The rest 50% will be borne by the vendors.NEERI's interim report indicated that coal-burning (30%) is the biggest contributor to PM2.5 pollution in Kolkata. Vehicle comes as the second biggest (26%) source of pollution. Since Kolkata's winter pollution is driven by PM2.5 - an air pollutant that is a concern for people's health when levels in air are high - the state has geared up to check the pollution level.According to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report, the city has 30,000 food vendors, who use coal-fired ovens. These food vendors cater to a huge customer base with low-cost food. While 33% of their consumers buy food daily, 23% buy food four days a week from them. Besides these food vendors, there are road-side ironing service providers, who also used these ovens. They will be given electric irons, said an environment department officer.Besides, the environment department is also planning to give vehicle-mounted water sprinklers to different civic bodies in the Kolkata metropolitan area. The mechanical sweepers will also reduce dust pollution to a great extent. Kolkata Municipal Corporation will also do buffer plantation along the roads. It was decided that water sprinklers will be deployed in 17 key areas, including Shyambazar five-point crossing, Maa flyover, Sealdah flyover, Park Circus seven-point crossing, surroundings of Victoria Memorial Hall, Taratala crossing, New Alipore Road, Prince Anwar Shah Road and Raja S C Mullick Road. IIT-Kharagpur has also been engaged for a detailed plan to combat burning of methane at Dhapa dumpyard. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Early detection of cancer in men: Screening recommendations,"According to Globocan 2018 data (a research on incidence, mortality rate and prevalence of 36 types of cancers in 185 countries), the five most prevalent cancers in Indian men are those of mouth, lung, stomach, colon and esophagus (food pipe). Lung and oral cancer together account for over 25 per cent cancer deaths among men in India. Fortunately, these most cancers can be prevented through early screening and detection. Due to the absence of significant symptoms which mostly go unnoticed, a large majority of cancer patients often seek medical intervention at an advanced or later stage when the disease becomes incurable. Only solution to this lies in timely and effective screening. /One must have a thorough discussion with their doctor before undergoing any form of screening to understand its risks and benefits. Genetic predisposition (genetic susceptibility) determines the right age and type of screening to be undertaken. Lung cancer screeningLung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths, globally. Though the ones at the highest risk are current or former smokers, it can also affect those who don't smoke. Apart from smoking, air pollution is one of the biggest causes of this disease. Lung cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, with poor resultant outcome. Therefore, screening becomes crucial for timely prevention or treatment.  Men aged between 55-75 years can undergo screening for lung cancer, especially if they are or were heavy smokers. The screening is conducted annually through a low-dose CT scan (LDCT) of the chest to help identify early stage lung cancers. Oral cancer screeningOral cancer refers to the cancer of lips, tongue, cheeks, floor of the mouth, hard and soft palate, and pharynx (throat). Those who regularly consume tobacco (smoking and chewable tobacco) and alcoholics are at a higher risk of developing oral cancer. Oral cancer is often preceded by a pre-malignant lesion and screening tests are recommended for high-risk adults with this symptom. A simple visual inspection can help detect premalignant conditions. Prostate cancer screeningProstate cancer affects the prostate gland which produces some of the fluid in semen and helps in controlling urine in men. Its incidence increases with age. The disease in its early localized stages can be treated through surgery and radiotherapy. Screening must begin from the age of 50 years and is done through a blood test called prostate specific antigen (PSA) test. If the PSA test is abnormal, further scans and a biopsy is recommended for confirming prostate cancer. Colon cancer screeningColon cancer, commonly referred to as colorectal cancer begins as non-cancerous clumps of cells called polyps in the large intestine which can over time develop into colon cancer. Men above the age of 50 years should routinely undergo screening for colon cancer and this should continue until the age of 75 years. Screening is also recommended for younger individuals with personal or family history of cancer, polyps, past exposure to radiation or history of inflammatory bowel disease.  Two types of screening are recommended for colon cancer - one that screens for both cancer and polyps, and other that just screens for cancer. Tests used for screening cancer and polyps include flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, double-contrast barium enema, or CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy). Tests that primarily screen only for cancer include stool testing for blood, or stool DNA testing. Many cancers are preventable. Avoiding smoking, consumption of alcohol, maintaining ideal body weight by consuming a balanced diet and being physically active are measures one can take to cut down their risk of cancer.

Lung cancer rising among non-smokers in Delhi: Study,"NEW DELHI: Delhi's polluted air could be leading to nonsmokers being as likely to develop lung cancer as smokers. That's the scary conclusion of a study by chest surgeons at the Centre for Chest Surgery in Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and Lung Care Foundation.The study analysed lung cancer surgeries over the past 30 years and found that while nine out of 10 cases in 1988 were those of smokers, by 2018 it was split evenly 5:5 between smokers and non-smokers.Even more alarmingly, 70% of those aged below 50 who had undergone surgery for lung cancer, were nonsmokers. In the below-30 age group, none was smoker. For the study, people who had quit smoking were also classified as smokers.Dr Harsh Vardhan Puri, consultant, Centre for Chest Surgery & Institute of Robotic Surgery at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, told TOI the study was done after doctors noticed a large number of patients with lung cancer who were relatively young or non-smokers.Lung cancer: Pollution a clear and present dangerDr Puri said troubled by the disturbing trend of young, non-smokers getting lung cancer, doctors at the hospital analysed the details of patients who had undergone treatment at the centre from March 2012 to June 2018.""This was then compared with the data from 1988 and it was discovered that there has been a significant increase in the number of non-smokers being affected by lung cancer now. /This figure, which was just 10% (of all cases), has increased to 50% now,"" Puri said.A total of 150 patients were analysed retrospectively. Their age when the disease manifested itself, sex, gender and smoking status were recorded and analysed, amongst other parameters.It was found that nearly 21% were below the age of 50 years with five out of 31 patients in the less-than-50 age group falling under the age of 30 years. ""Nearly 50% of our patients were non-smokers. Even more distressing was the fact that this figure rose to 70% in the younger age group (below age 50). None of the lessthan-30 years patients were smokers,"" the study states.The study also points towards cases being misdiagnosed and lung cancer in women having increased significantly. ""The male to female ratio of our study group was 3.8:1, indicating a significant rise in the proportion of female patients compared to studies in the past.... Nearly 30% of our patients had been initially misdiagnosed as tuberculosis and were treated for tuberculosis for many months, leading to delay in definitive diagnosis and treatment,"" the study said.Referring to the case of a 28-year old woman who recently was admitted with stage IV lung cancer, Puri said the woman had never smoked in her life and upon questioning how this could have happened, he said the doctors could only point to Delhi's poor air.""The data analysed does not lie and indicates that over the long run, air quality may be impacting you severely. The impacts may not be immediate, but slow regression and eventually cancer is a possibility,"" said Puri.The study says that while lung cancer has largely been termed as a ""smoker's disease"", the scenario may well be changing in Delhi, owing to the high pollution levels. ""Lung cancer has typically been called a smoker's disease, a disease of old age and strong male preponderance. But this is fast changing in our patient population. Our study draws attention to the need for more robust data collection for lung cancer in the country and the need for action to prevent lung cancer deaths by early detection, smoking cessation and strong and immediate measures to control both outdoor as well as indoor air pollution,"" the report states.Chitra Mukherjee, head of advocacy and policy at the NGO, Chintan, said the study was an indicator of Delhi's polluted air and the impact it may be having on individuals over time. ""It would seem nonsmokers are relatively safe, but if more cases are coming up where they are being impacted, it shows how polluted the air is that we are breathing,"" said Mukherjee.

Air quality touches danger mark at Pydibheemavaram,"Visakhapatnam: Pydibheemavaram in Srikakulam district, located nearly 80km away from the city registered PM10 levels at 130 at noon on Tuesday.As per the live update chart of the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB), this was the only area in the state while registered 130 at the PM10 levels. The event triggered panic among inhabitants along national highway-16.APPCB Visakhapatnam zone's joint chief environment engineer, T Rajendra Reddy said that the area registered the PM 10 130 mark on June 24 as well. /Reddy said that the alarming PM10 levels at Pydibheemavaram could be attributed to factors like the release of effluents from industries and traffic conditions on the highway. ""If PM 10 reaches the yellow mark, that is over 100, it indicates that the air quality is reaching the danger mark (red) and there will be moderate breathing trouble among people with lung and heart diseases and asthma,"" Reddy told TOI.He added that the national average value of PM 10 is 60. ""Places like New Delhi always register PM 10 above 300. Main stakeholders like the police, local bodies and transport departments should carry out frequent action plans to control air pollution,"" he added.Srikakulam SP, RN Ammi Reddy said that all necessary steps were being taken to control traffic jams at the highway.An environmental representative working at a pharmaceutical unit in the area said that the government must finish the road-widening works at NH-16 at the earliest.Pydibheemavaram houses a number of bulk drug and chemical factories and the region is close to the Bay of Bengal.

"4,000-plus tempos flout CNG switch order, add to pollution","Allahabad: Green vehicles seem a distant dream in Sangam City.Three years and two extended deadlines later, only 24% of the total 5,900 diesel-run tempos and three-wheelers have been converted into compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles. In the absence of a sustained crackdown, 76% of these vehicles continue to flout pollution norms by not switching to CNG. In 2016, the district authorities had initiated the process of setting up CNG stations in the city and directed commercial vehicle owners to convert their diesel-run fleet, including buses, into one that operated on the biofuel. /Citing poor awareness among vehicle owners, the deadline was extended twice - once in 2017 and again in 2018. During this period, only 167 school buses, 129 private buses and 1,492 three-wheelers switched to the CNG mode. Hence, the five CNG stations today sell only 15,000kg of biofuel a day out of their total capacity of 1.22 lakh kilogram. There are 10,930 registered diesel-run three-wheelers in the district, out of which 5,900 ply in the city. Currently, more than 4,400 of these vehicles continue to belch smoke and raise air pollution levels.According to the latest UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) data, the air quality index (AQI) ranges from 163 to 255 in various parts of the city. An AQI at 163 and above results in breathing discomfort, and lung and heart diseases in both children and adults. People living in places where the AQI is 255 are likely to suffer from chronic respiratory distress if exposure is prolonged.Sources said the CNG switch was aimed at decreasing pollution levels in the city, but there had been ""no serious effort"" on the part of the regional transport office to crack down on diesel vehicles. Regional transport officer DK Singh rubbished the allegation and claimed the permit of all diesel-powered tempos/autos plying within city limits had been cancelled. ""Vehicles still running on diesel will be seized. Apart from this, a three-member committee has been constituted to give permits to CNG vehicles,"" Singh added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
A CITY FOR OUR CHILDREN,"BENGALURU: Having been born and brought up in the Bangalore which was truly a 'garden city', which lived up to its name, I still dream of giving that beautiful city back to our children. Many of us who have lived in this city since childhood, can vouch for the drastic change in weather. We would boast of belonging to a city which never needed a fan, let alone an air conditioner, as the weather would always be just perfect. The roads would be clean and easy to cycle on and the parks lush for the elderly to walk in. But where has that city gone?/ With increasing respiratory issues in children, it is time for us to act.Environmentally Conscious ChildrenChange must begin at home and at an early age for it to be long lasting! There are various things that you could inculcate into your lifestyle at home which would make your children more environmentally conscious citizens for the future.Firstly, reduce Plastic in your house. This needs to be taught to children right from their childhood days. Simple things like making sure everyone carries a shopping bag and says no to plastic bags makes it a part of their lifestyle too. Tell them to say no to disposable cutlery, plastic straws and plastic bottles.This indirectly would also work towards our next goal, to reduce the amount of garbage that a household would produce. It is natural for a child to throw something he or she does not like without thinking. We need to teach our children to buy and use only things they need. Show them how to segregate wet and dry waste at an early age. Help them understand on how producing less garbage creates less issues of garbage disposal. This is an emergency that Bangalore is facing and we all need to work towards producing less garbage. This would further help in reducing diseases like dengue, and water and food borne infections like gastroenteritis and Typhoid fever, which is scarily rampant in the city.I remember when we were children, our parents would make a point of telling us to switch off the lights and fans when not in use, saying the electricity bills would be high. I remember laughing about it then. But in reality what we have inculcated in us is a sense of conservation of electricity. This should be passed on to the next generation, to understand the importance of conserving electricity for all of us as a city. In today's era of water scarcity, the future looks bleak if our children don't realise that conserving water is of utmost importance. Ask them to think about how much water they can save during brushing, washing their hands and other regular activities during the day. You would be surprised at the innovative ways they would come up with to save water. This would help us create environmentally conscious citizens.Clean, Safe and Healthy Air As pediatric pulmonologist, I see children with asthma and chronic lung problems from across different parts of Bengaluru daily. Although I would say some areas are worse than the others, the same story is spread across the city. All over the world we are seeing an increase in the incidence of asthma and allergies. It has been clearly shown by studies in India that children who live closer to highways and busy roads are more prone to develop symptoms of wheezing. Then why are we still thinking twice on the urgency to regulate the quality of air that our children breathe? I would wish to see Bangaloreans passionately focus on reducing air pollution together. Ensure that there are no open burning of waste in your surroundings. Many people think that burning dry leaves, tyres and garbage will solve the solution of the growing garbage. This only adds more to the existing air pollution and emits dangerous chemicals which our kids breathe.We need to learn to carpool and use more public transport. In addition to government effort, we need to work to reduce the number of cars and two-wheelers on our own. Schools are another matter. We do not have enough data on the level of indoor and outdoor air pollution at schools. Many schools are located in high traffic zones and this could pose an impact on the lung function of children. This is something that I am actively working on currently to produce sufficient data and an active plan on how we could make the air in schools of the recommended quality. I would want to see a more conducive school environment for our children, where the air they breathe and the water they drink are safe and healthy. I also hope for a day when all public places in Bangalore are free from tobacco smoke, and for children to never take it up.Encourage Physical Activity As I encounter many children of all ages, one clear change that has happened in this generation, is the lack of physical play activities. They are so glued to video games, toys and TVs that it has begun to take a toll on their health. Child obesity is rising, with studies reporting rates ranging from 10% to 16% in schoolgoing kids.I reminiscence on those days when as kids in Bangalore, we would go cycling to school. I would wish for an opportunity for the children of today to be able to go to schools cycling, safely. This not only helps them maintain their body in good shape, but also inculcates a sense of independence. The day cycling paths are created in the city, many parents would be confident to allow their children to cycle to school, without worrying about being hit by the unpredictable Bengaluru traffic. Until then, it would be great if parents could make it a habit to take their children to spaces where they could cycle and enjoy that one pleasure of childhood.When we need to travel short distances, encourage your children to walk and not always use the car or two-wheeler. This not only reduces pollution but also encourages physical activity. Footpaths in our city are just not meant for walking. This is where i wish to see Bangalore become a model city, which creates sufficient space on all roads for pedestrians to walk.Amidst all this lack of outside play and physical activity, Vitamin D deficiency is on the rise across the country. There is very little time that our children spend in the sun. With our air conditioners on blast, we forget the essence of health, sunlight. Encourage your children to play in the sun. It is absolutely needed to replenish the Vitamin D stores in our body.More Green SpacesAs we work towards creating a better Bangalore, it is indeed heart-warming to see the local authorities take on the need for the city's lung space seriously and rejuvenate the many parks in Bangalore. You can see your local BBMP park being maintained with nice walking paths and kids play areas being re-created.You and I can also contribute to make Bangalore greener. Get your children to understand the importance of plants in our lives, by making them a small garden in your house. It could be a simple garden in your balcony, with basic potted plants. But this will go a long way in your child becoming environmentally conscious and love gardening. It is up to us to teach children the key which will save their future - to plant more trees!By shaping environmentally conscious and physically active children, we can help bring down the pollution in our city. I am hopeful that there will be a day when we recreate the Bangalore of yesteryear and our city lives up to the tag 'Garden city' again.(The writer, Dr KR Bharath Kumar Reddy, is the director of Shishuka Children's Hospital)MY VISION FOR BENGALURU For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Heart attacks rising among young adults,"A 16-year-old first PUC student, in Bengaluru, recently had to check into a cardiac facility after suffering from chest discomfort. Ranjan S (name changed) was taken aback when the doctors informed him that he was treated for a heart attack. This happened despite him maintaining a healthy lifestyle and a no-cigarette case history. /Yes, it's a worrisome example, because his is not a one-off case. Of late, Bengaluru's cardiologists have recorded an increase in the number of Premature Coronary Artery Disease (PCAD) cases among people in the younger age group. The PCAD registry, maintained by Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, has disclosed that over the past two years, over 2,400 cases of heart attack have been recorded among patients under the age of 40. Out of these, 1,250 fresh heart attack cases have been reported among patients below 35 years. Is our heart giving up on us earlier? A Bengaluru-based cardiologist is taking stock of this disturbing trend with the help of what is touted to be the country's first heart attack registry.Not the regular heart attacksDr Rahul Patil - Interventional Cardiologist and Head of the Premature Heart Disease Division at Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences - who is spearheading the study points out that these heart attacks are not the regular ones that usually occur when a person is in his or her 50s or 60s. ""The younger age group displays a different set of triggers. Of these cases, hardly 12-13% are caused due to diabetes or hypertension. There's a huge difference between the risk factors in the age groups,"" says Dr Rahul, stressing that the registry will now help to study the pattern and the risk factors closely. Young age heart attack comes with no warning signsApparently, heart attacks at a younger age come without any signs of warning. ""Over the past two years, we have had nearly 111 deaths among patients below the age of 40, mainly because there were no symptoms of a potential heart problem,"" Dr Rahul further explains. Cases have been linked to air pollution and dietary patternsYes, it is not only because of bad lifestyle and stress. Pollution and high-carb diet might also have a critical role to play in the upsurge of heart attacks. ""More than what young adults eat, it's the timing that can cause more health issues. Late lunch and dinner, with huge portions of carbs and meats is a worrying eating pattern,"" the expert warns. Statistics show that drivers comprise nearly 24% of the heart attack cases, followed by professionals who spend almost an hour commuting in peak traffic every day. ""The angiographic profile of these patients showed high levels of haemoglobin (as high as 18-19 g/dl). However, we need to do a proper population study to have a better understanding of these trends,"" he adds. The PCAD Registry will help find answersThe registry, which is said to be the world's largest PCAD registry, is expected to help find a link between heart attacks and their causes. ""We are working with St. John's Research Institute (SJRI) and the Health and Environment Alliance study the causes and find solutions,"" sums up Dr Rahul.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
New device delivers asthma drugs to lungs without fuss,"Nagpur: With air pollution, weather changes, increased traffic and construction activities, prevalence of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPDs) is on the rise. Even though lung disorders have jumped to 2nd spot from 9th since 1990 as leading cause of deaths, there is still ignorance about the proper way to use inhalers among patients as well as physicians.Improper use of inhalers has led to poor symptom control and worsening of the condition. Keeping this difficulty in mind, chest physicians and pulmonologists have been prescribing a 'breath-actuated device' which ensures perfect drug delivery. /The new device, which appears exactly like the regularly used inhalers, doesn't require to be pumped but simply inhaled by keeping it inside the mouth. Now, patients also won't need spacers and matching of breath with the dose.Pulmonologists Dr Vikrant Deshmukh and Dr Vinit Niranjane on Thursday held a demonstration on 'Correct use of device in asthma management' in the city.They said a correct knowledge on therapy/devise use-ability can lead to increased patient satisfaction, better health outcomes, and reduced use of health care resources. ""In asthma, it becomes critical as a lot depends on the inhaled medicines. They deliver drugs directly to the lungs and hence act faster and at a lower dose, thereby reducing the risk of side effects,"" said Dr Deshmukh.Dr Niranjane said if inhalers are not used correctly, it can worsen the condition. ""In Maharashtra, chronic respiratory disease is the number one leading cause of death in the 40-69 year age group and the second leading cause of death in the 15-39 years age group,"" he said.A study showed that incorrect device technique by nearly 61% patients and non-adherence to inhalation therapy by 67% physicians were responsible for poor outcomes to therapy.""Education and awareness on asthma management is the need of the hour. Patients need to be viewed as involved participants in their asthma management plan. Various inhaler devices available include the pressurized metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), dry powder inhalers (DPIs) and nebulizers,"" said Deshmukh, adding that each pose their own set of problems while the new device overcomes those challenges.Approximately 90% of physicians in India reported prescribing inhaler devices to at least 40% of their asthma and COPD patients in the first clinic visit. Many patients find MDIs difficult to use correctly, said Niranjane. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Adopt pollution control norms by October 31, hotels told","PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Saturday asked hotel and restaurant owners in the state to comply with pollution control and waste management norms by October 31.Addressing a stakeholders' meeting organised by Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) here, Modi said, ""Hotels, restaurants and small eateries have been given two-month time to apply for the mandatory consent to establish (CTE) certificate. Existing hotels and restaurants also need to apply for obtaining CTE by October 31.""BSPCB officials said the CTE and consent to operate (CTO) is required to be obtained by industrial units, including hotels and eateries as per Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution), Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.Similarly, waste management norms as per new rules framed in 2016 for environment protection are required to be complied by such units for treatment of waste water as well as scientific disposal of waste. Sources, however, said the rules were seldom followed by hotels and eateries in Bihar. /Of late, the government has become strict on their pursuance in the wake of recent orders by National Green Tribunal in this regard.""Big hotels are required to set up sewerage treatment plants (STPs) based on size of the establishment and volume of generation of waste water. Restaurants and small eateries are also required to discharge waste water only after removing pollutants through proper method filtering,"" Modi told TOI.Hotels, restaurants and eateries have also been asked to take steps for segregation of waste. ""Big hotels and restaurants are also required to make compost units,"" he said.The hotels and restaurants have also been asked to take steps to curb noise and air pollution. ""The commercial entities should ensure installation of scientific chimneys for emission of smoke from kitchens. They have also been asked not to play DJ music and loud sound after 10pm,"" the deputy CM said. Earlier, the BSPCB had issued show-cause notices to over 179 hotels, restaurants and resorts in Patna, Bhojpur, Vaishali and other districts on August 29 for running their businesses without obtaining CTE and CTO certificates.

"Air pollution raises heart disease risk in counties like India and China, study says","CHENNAI: Air pollution increased the risk for heart diseases in middle and low-income countries like China and India, says a study published in the medical journal Lancet. The study - ""Modifiable risk factors cardiovascular diseases, and mortality from 21 higher, middle and lower income countries (pure): a prospective cohort"" -- says hypertension, cholesterol, air-pollution, diabetes and poor diet are the main factors for cardiovascular disease in low-income groups while cholesterol, tobacco, hypertension, diabetes and abdominal obesity the main factors in high-income groups. Responding to the findings in the study, Chennai-based diabetologist Dr V Mohan stressed on the importance of controlling air pollution. /""At present, we have poor access to treatment and adherence to treatment. But more than anything else, we have air pollution that worsens health condition. This needs urgent attention,"" he said.'Cancer may become leading cause of death'Another study published in Lancet says heart diseases kill most people in the world, but in high-income countries deaths due to cancers are twice as frequent heart diseases. The study documented the frequency of common diseases and death rates across countries.The study, presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress, is from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study led by the Population Health Research Institute (PHRI) of McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences in Hamilton, Canada. Scientists studied more than 162,500 adults aged 35 to 70 from 21 countries and followed them up for nearly a decade.Results showed that for every six cancer deaths, there were four deaths due to cardiac diseases in the high-come countries such as Canada, Sweden, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. In the middle-income countries Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Malaysia and the Philippines, there was one cardio vascular death for every cancer death. In the low-income group such as Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, there were three cardiac deaths for every death caused by cancer.The study, according to the principal investigator Salim Yusuf, also executive director of PHRI and a professor of medicine at McMaster University said, indicates a transition in the predominant causes of death in middle age. ""As CVD declines in many countries because of prevention and treatment, cancer mortality will likely become the leading cause of death globally in the future. The high mortality in poorer countries is not due to a higher burden of risk factors, but likely other factors including lower quality and less healthcare,"" he said.

"Blast at chemical factory, 1 hurt while running out","Secunderabad: A chemical reactor exploded at a chemical factory in Industrial Development Area, Nacharam on Thursday night. Six workers who were in the factory at the time of the accident managed to run to safety, but one was injured after he fell from a staircase while running out. A reactor in the chemical factory, DSN Labs, is suspected to have exploded due to overheating and also damaged another reactor kept next to it. /""Due to the impact of the explosion, the windows of a nearby factory broke. The tin shed of the G+1 storey chemical factory was also affected,"" said station fire officer Mallesh. The incident occurred on Thursday around 11.50 pm. Two fire tenders worked for over an hour to douse the fire completely. ""We were fighting the fire from a distance as we were not sure if another reactor would explode,"" added the officer. According to a source, the property damage is estimated to be around Rs 9 lakh.It was not the first explosion in the area this year. A resident of IDA Nacharam tweeted to minister KT Rama Rao, about the incident on social media asking to remove the factories from residential areas.

2024 target: Delhi needs 5L new electric vehicles,"New Delhi: To meet Delhi's draft electric vehicle policy target of 25% share for electric vehicles (EVs) in new registrations by 2024, Delhi will need to register approximately five lakh new EVs in the next five years, a new report says.The report titled 'Accelerating Delhi's Mobility Transition: Insights from the Delhi Urban Mobility Lab' has been prepared by the Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi and Rocky Mountain Institute. It was submitted to Delhi's transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Monday.The report states that over their lifetime, these EVs are estimated to avoid approximately Rs 6,000 crore in oil and liquid natural gas imports and 4.8 million tonnes of CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions, equivalent to avoiding CO2 emissions from nearly 1 lakh petrol cars over their lifetime. They will also help avoid about 159 tonnes of PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) tailpipe emissions, a known cause of respiratory diseases and premature deaths.The report proposes ten actionable solutions to accelerate Delhi's transition to a shared, clean, and people-centric mobility future, including 35,000 electric vehicles within a year. /The report also identifies the economic and environmental benefits of an electric mobility future in Delhi. The report proposes actionable solutions by summarizing discussions and suggestions from a workshop that was held on June 26-27 in Delhi.""As Delhi looks to take ambitious steps towards inducting large number of electric buses and taking leadership in fighting air pollution, this report will become an important reference point for all our agencies on the various reforms needed to ensure a successful transition to electric vehicles,"" Gahlot said.One of the many proposed solutions in the report is the creation of a single-window clearance system that provides clearer and simpler processes for both registering and permitting EVs, as well as commissioning charging and battery swapping infrastructure. Another is a more attractive financing for EVs through a government-led interest rate subvention scheme. Others include data solutions, awareness campaigns, and capacity-building programmes.At the workshop, solution providers shared ambitious goals for deploying clean, shared, and people-centric mobility solutions in Delhi. Over the next year, the participants intend to deploy nearly 35,000 electric and accessible passenger vehicles and several public charging and swapping stations across Delhi. In addition to vehicles and hardware, other goals include getting thousands of users on to digital ride-hailing and data-sharing platforms and ensuring that information related to routes and fares is accessible in multiple formats.

EPCA orders 4 states to curb waste burning,"CHANDIGARH: The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority has directed chief secretaries of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to contain air pollution arising from open garbage burning. The EPCA has also sought dates from each one of them to enable it to hold meeting with them in their respective state over the action plan prepared by them to combat garbage burning. It is to be noted that these states are also on radar for stubble burning. /The EPCA is a statutory body constituted by the Union government in 1998 following a Supreme Court order to control air pollution. Bhure Lal, a retired IAS officer, is its chairman. Since 2016, most parts of Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR) have been engulfing in thick blanket of hazardous smog in the period falling between October 15 to March 15. The experts are of the opinion that smoke billowing from these fires mix with the atmosphere gases such as nitrogen oxide, methane and ammonia and create highly polluted smog, which remains suspended for days together. This causes respiratory problems besides other serious health ailments to residents. The region saw one of the worst air pollution scenario in 2017 when it peaked on both PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels. It, however, improved last year on account of measures taken by the EPCA, which are largely known as graded response action plan.The offenders who had been flouting norms with regard to ban on account of crop residue and garbage burning have been punished with penalties ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 in the past.""We are going to be quite strict this time. The repeated offenders will be sentenced to jail term also,"" said Lal.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Mumbai's air pollution is now 50% above permissible limits,"MUMBAI: Civic data compiled for the financial year 2018-19 has painted a worrying picture of Mumbai's air quality, reversing the improvement shown in the previous year.The annual average PM 2.5 levels stayed in the 41-86 (micrograms per cubic metre) bracket this year across locations in the city. The most polluted area with a PM 2.5 of 86 this year was Bandra-Kurla Complex (see graphic). In 2017-18, the highest concentration was at Mazgaon (68) with BKC a close second at 67. This year, BKC is followed by Andheri at 79 as the second most polluted place in the city.The BMC's report each year collates the annual average levels for pollutants from air monitoring stations operated by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and their own.Another key pollutant, nitrogen dioxide, too breached the permissible limit of 40. At the four BMC monitoring sites, the levels were in the range of 50 to 69 (micrograms per cubic metre) this year. Short-term and long-term exposure to high levels of PM and nitrogen dioxide could lead to respiratory diseases.Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR, attributed the increase to lower rainfall last year. /""Last year, the city received lower rainfall which could be reflecting in the average because Mumbai benefits largely from the rains which washes off the pollutants."" Last year, Mumbai did not receive enough rain to meet its annual average.Experts feel we cannot rely on the natural forces for clean air. ""A coastal city like Mumbai must not have such levels of pollution. This is a result of emissions from the unscientific burning of waste, poorly planned transport system, industrial belts in the neighbourhood and congestion on the roads. There is a need to include a sustainable city model, where the objective is not just to find place for people to live. There must be adequate public transport, walkways for citizens. The key to bringing down emissions would be to reduce the use of private cars and petroleum products,"" said Sunil Dahiya, clean air analyst with Greenpeace East Asia. In 2016, Mumbai was ranked the 63th most polluted city among 859 others in the world that recorded PM 2.5 levels.Activists said construction and congestion on the roads are causes that need attention. Godfrey Pimenta from Watchdog Foundation said: ""There is construction across the city that results in increasing the dust in the air. As a result of the bad roads, the vehicles travel much slower than they should, thereby increasing the pollutants in the air."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Polluted air behind 40% COPD cases, says KGMU","Lucknow: Air pollution accounts for 40% cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among patients visiting King George's Medical University (KGMU), a study by its pulmonary medicine department has revealed. The cause is second to smoking.The study, conducted by head of department professor Surya Kant, covered 360 patients over a period of three years from 2016. ""As many as 216 were found to have acquired COPD because of smoking while the remaining 144 non-smokers were exposed to pollutants in the air,"" said the professor whose paper was recently published in the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.COPD is an umbrella term used to describe progressive lung diseases, including emphysema, chronic bronchitis and refractory (non-reversible) asthma. It is characterised by increasing breathlessness. /Symptoms may include chronic cough with sputum, swelling in legs, weight loss and loss of appetite. The survey also showed that those smoking regularly for 8-10 years developed COPD at the age of 60-70 years whereas most non-smokers were affected by the age of 51-60 years. In other words, non-smokers pay for pollutants in the air.Among COPD patients addicted to smoking, 75% were men and 25% women. The fair sex also constitutes 70% of non-smokers. This, the professor said, showed that women were susceptible to the harmful effects of air pollution.According to the Air Quality Index of the Central Pollution Control Board, people in Lucknow got to breathe ""good air"" only for two days in 2018 and 17 days in 2017. Air quality is ""good"" when AQI is 60 and it is satisfactory between 60-100. Studies in the past have already revealed that in addition to vehicular emission, dust particles because of construction work and bad roads were behind air pollution in the city. Professor Surya Kant said the study further indicated that bad quality of air, which we experience in the open, was now inside our homes too. He said in urban slums and rural areas, women are falling prey to pollution caused by wood/charcoal cooking. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Chennai: 'Early diagnosis key to combating lung cancer',"CHENNAI: Even one cigarette a day can ruin your health drastically, but being a non-smoker doesn't save you from lung cancer. Oncologists at the Chennai-based Cancer Institute are pushing to create awareness for early diagnosis of the disease after a study by the hospital in 2017 found that more than 55% of its lung cancer patients were non-smokers. Globally, lung cancer is the fourth largest cause of mortality.Published in 2017, the study showed that non-smokers outnumber smokers on the lung cancer patient list at the hospital. /""Literature shows evidence of environmental tobacco, air pollution including increased levels of PM 2.5, as causes for triggering lung cancer among non-smokers, but we need a large population-based study on this. Doctors and policy makers should look beyond tobacco exposure,"" said Dr Arvind Krishnamoorthy, a professor at Cancer Institute.Although lethal, the disease is curable when treated in its first or early second stage. However, only 5% of patients at Cancer Institute come in the early stages, Dr Arvind said. At least 70% of cases are detected in fourth stage and nearly 25% in the third stage, he said. In these later stages, the cancer spreads to both lungs and becomes unmanageable.""I decided to talk about it because we need people to come in early with the disease,"" he said.Dr Arvind, who met reporters on Tuesday, said while lung cancer is the most common among men in Chennai, accounting for 13% of deaths, its incidence is rapidly increasing among women. As per Cancer Institute, for every 100 men diagnosed with cancer, there were 115 women. Although cancers of breast, cervix, ovary and uterus top cancers among women, the incidence of lung cancer is seeing a spike.Lung cancer doesn't show visible symptoms in its earliest stages, but doctors advise not to ignore a recurring cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, hoarseness, sudden weight loss and headache.

25% heart attack patients below 40: Jayadeva study,"Bengaluru: For 29-year-old Kumar (name changed), severe chest pain last year didn't trigger alarm bells of a heart attack. He was neither a regular smoker nor drank alcohol frequently. ""I always thought only people over 50 suffered heart attacks. /It was a huge shock,"" said this truck driver.""I realised late it was because of my exposure to pollution for eight hours every day. The long journeys almost cost me my life,"" Kumar said, adding he changed his lifestyle after an angiography.Kumar is among 2,400 people below 35 years who were admitted to the Premature Coronary Artery Disease Clinic (PCAD Clinic) at the Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research after suffering a heart attack. A two-year study revealed an indirect link between heart attacks among youngsters and air pollution. The study was released at the institute on Friday to mark World Heart Day. They began connecting the dots after realising that almost 25% of patients were below 40 years who didn't smoke or drink. Dr Rahul S Patil, a doctor involved in the research, said almost all their patients would ask, 'Why us when we don't smoke or drink?'. Institute director Dr CN Manjunath called air pollution the new tobacco, adding that in the past children would bring their parents with heart ailments to hospitals. Lately, a large number of parents are bringing children with heart conditions. ""25% of our patients are drivers who spent hours stuck in traffic jams. Their blood showed a high amount of carboxy-haemoglobin,"" Manjunath said.Standing in the same polluted junction for five minutes equals smoking five cigarettes, Dr Manjunath said, adding that the study proved that heart attacks can affect people who don't have health issues like diabetes or blood pressure.Dr Patil added that the condition of Indians' hearts is the worst in the world. ""The age at which an Indian suffers the first heart attack is 10 years earlier than the global average age,"" he said, adding that they get 100-130 cases every month of people under 40.Experts called for better infrastructure, reduction in construction debris and traffic management.

If things work out in accordance with plans, work on a new solid waste treatment project will begin on a 12 acre plot at Mahispota, a remote part of Sodepur off Kalyani Expressway, after Durga Puja.Panihati MLA and chief government whip in the assembly, Nirmal Ghosh, said, ""The locals' problem about garbage disposal will be resolved as the work on solid waste management and treatment project will start after the festival. /The estimated cost of the project is Rs 45 crore, which has already been sanctioned by the state government. Wastes from five other neighbouring municipalities will also be processed there."" Sodepur Municipality sources said, ""In keeping with the state government's order, a 12 acre plot at Mahispota off Kalyani Expressway was acquired in 2017 to set up a dumping ground. But the project did not take off then. However, the work is set to start finally after the Puja.""Located in a crowded area of Sodepur on the northern fringes of the city, the Ramchandrapur garbage dumping ground has been forcing thousands of people within its 10km radius to live in miserable conditions for over two decades. Clogged drains, flooded roads, air pollution and contaminated water have created an unhealthy environment, making locals suffer from various diseases round the year. Sources said environmentalists had also filed a case in Calcutta High Court in 2002 against such unhygienic dumping ground in a crowded locality.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Cough-and-cold outbreak hits Kolkata; doctors say stay away from crowds,"KOLKATA: With the dengue threat still looming large, a cough-and-cold outbreak has gripped the city on the eve of Durga Puja. Thousands have been afflicted with a wheezing cough triggered by viral and bacterial infections, which have seen a spurt over the last fortnight. Sporadic showers and fluctuating temperature have made the conditions ideal for viruses and bacteria to turn active, explained doctors, warning that the Puja crowd could further spread infections.""Weather conditions have turned favourable for viruses like adeno and rhino, and bacteria like streptococcus, to flourish and attack humans. /Temperature fluctuation often triggers an allergic reaction that swells the nasal passage and throat. It attracts viruses and bacteria that infiltrate the nose and throat, leading to bouts of cough and cold. This year, it has been very severe and has affected a large number of people. With the crowds building up across the city, the infection is spreading very fast,"" said consultant Arindam Biswas.The majority of those affected are children who are vulnerable due to their lower immunity. Rising air pollution is the principal reason why children have been falling prey to respiratory ailments, according to Fortis Hospital consultant paediatrician Sumita Saha. ""Pollution levels have gone up in the past few years and so have the diseases triggered by pollution. The suspended particles in the air give rise to irritation in the lining of the lungs, which, in turn, can cause asthma, allergic rhinitis and reactive airway disease. The incidence of these ailments has gone up considerably in the past few years. During the festive season, fireworks spew poisonous particles and smoke, which can act as irritants for the respiratory epithelium or the lining of the lung tissue. This causes recurrent asthmatic episodes or wheezing,"" explained Saha.She added that the period leading up to the festival saw a sudden spurt in the number of cough-and-cold patients. ""Many are suffering from a persistent cough that has refused to go without antibiotics. Children have been more frequently affected, catching infections from school,"" she said.Those aged between six months and five years have also been falling prey to bronchiolitis triggered by the RSV virus. ""RSV starts spreading in the rainy season and gets more potent with temperature fluctuations. Scores have been affected over the last two weeks. Bronchiolitis leads to breathing distress, similar to asthma, but it's a viral disease. It leaves children weak since they can't eat properly and many require oxygen support. I have come across several cases last month in which youngsters had to be hospitalized,"" said paediatrician Shantanu Ray.Biswas advised citizens to wear masks to pandals and keep tissues handy. ""The chances of an infection are high in crowded places and most places will now teem with revellers,"" said Biswas, adding that anti-allergy drugs could be prescribed to check the infection. ""In case the colour of the sputum changes or the patient starts running a high temperature, antibiotics should be taken,"" Biswas said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
5 squads to monitor stubble burning in Bijnor,"Bijnor: With harvesting of early variety of paddy on, district administration has sounded an alert against stubble burning by farmers as it causes severe air pollution that engulfs a huge area, including Delhi. Five flying squads have been set up by the local administration and village pradhans have been warned to help curb the menace. At the same time, efforts are on to create awareness among farmers through announcements that if they indulge in stubble burning, a heavy penalty will be imposed on them.According to officials, 60,000 hectare area is under paddy cultivation in Bijnor district. /Every year, farmers burn stubble of paddy crop, causing massive pollution. As the period coincides with winter, a brownish haze with suspended particulate matter hovers over large areas, blocking sunlight and causing health problems to both man and animal.To curb the practice, government has fixed a penalty Rs 2,500, 5,000 and 15,000 for violating norms set in 2016. However, in Bijnor no penalty has ever been slapped on any farmer till date.This time around, administration has formed five flying squads in the district which will conduct surprise checks in rural areas. District magistrate Ramakant Pandey has instructed all village heads and revenue staff to keep an eagle eye on stubble burning activities in their respective areas. There are 1,128 village heads in the district.Giving details, district agriculture officer Avdhesh Mishra, ""Paddy is set to be harvested. In some places, it has already begun. Due to labour crunch, the crops are harvested by machines. Later, some farmers burn the residual matter left in the fields. This causes a high level of pollution. The government is providing agriculture waste management instruments to farmers with which they can easily destroy stubble in their fields.""According to JP Chaudhary, deputy director agriculture, due to stubble burning, organic carbon or humus is deceasing in the soil. According to soil testing reports, earlier there was above 0.8% humus in the soil which has dipped to below 0.2%. The health of the soil is deteriorating. ""All village heads and revenue staff have been put on alert."" said Chaudhary. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Severe virus strain leading to longer spells of fever,"New Delhi: The change of seasons has led to a spate of viral illnesses in the city.In the last week, doctors say the number of patients visiting hospitals with fever, sore throat, cough and general weakness - the characteristic symptoms of viral illnesses -have gone up significantly. ""Almost every third patient visiting the OPD has viral illness,"" said Dr Rommel Tickoo, senior consultant, internal medicine at Max Saket.Usually, fever caused by seasonal viral illnesses subsides in a couple of days. But, the doctors say, many patients are complaining of fever continuing for three to four days. /""Multiple viruses can cause fever, sore throat and other symptoms. It is possible that this time influenza A virus, which is relatively more severe, is predominant. This may be leading to a longer spell of fever in patients,"" said Dr Arup Basu, senior consultant, department of chest medicine at Sir Ganga Ram hospital.He added that children, elderly and people with co-morbidities such as diabetes and heart disease should be extra careful.Viruses are transmitted in two ways - through the air and by consuming infected food or water. Common cold, flu and respiratory infections usually spread through air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The best way to avoid catching the infection is to maintain hand hygiene and stay away from an infected person, say doctors.If the fever and sore throat last for more than 48 hours, one should always consult a doctor, says Dr R K Singhal, director of internal medicine at BLK super specialty hospital.Change of seasons also increases the risk of upper respiratory infection and allergy. With the onset of winter, there is wide variation in the day and the night temperature which, doctors say, is most suitable for bacterial growth and transmission of viral infection. ""Air pollution, which is on the rise in the city, makes the symptoms of viral illnesses worse and recovery even longer,"" say doctors.Next week, Delhi is set to host a marathon run. It is advised that the participants should check the weather forecast and prepare themselves accordingly. ""If pollution level is significantly high, those with pre-existing respiratory illnesses may need to reconsider running for long,"" doctors advise. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
No check on waste burning in Ghaziabad even as AQI hits 'very poor' mark,"GHAZIABAD: The Air Quality Index of Ghaziabad on Wednesday was recorded at 339 which comes under 'very poor' category. As per SAMEER app of ministry of environment, forest and climate change in the list of 105 cities in the country there are 10 cities whose AQI have been in the 'very poor' range on Wednesday with Ghaziabad at 339 AQI being second most polluted city in the country after Panipat, AQI of which was recorded at 340.As per Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) directions, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) comes into effect in case AQI hovers between 'very poor' and 'severe' category, which obviously means that GRAP has very much come into effect in the city that should ideally have prompted UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) and district administration to come up with a slew of measures to check air pollution and that is what administration is claiming. However, reality is far from it. /A patch of land near between Hindon canal road and Pustha road that connects Indirapuram is littered by tons of waste, which have been set on fire and smoke is billowing from it for ten days continuously now and yet no government departments or agencies have taken note of it. Ishwari Prasad who runs a kiosk on the stretch says ""for the last ten days or so smoke is billowing from the spot and even though my kiosk is about 50 m it has left us with an uneasy feeling."" When asked who is dumping waste at the spot and setting it on fire, Ishwari says ""in the middle of night we could hear dumpers coming to the spot and leaves after emptying tons of waste at the spot.""The area is not very populous and barring some farm houses and wedding halls there are open fields which makes easy for voters to dump waste here who set it on fire to make space for more dumping.Meanwhile, at Indirapuram polluting monitoring station, the AQI of Wednesday was recorded at 320 which comes under 'Very Poor' category.The district administration and pollution control department in last few weeks had claimed that it had taken measures to control air pollution. Three night vigil crack teams were constituted to look for garbage burning and industrial pollution. The district administration has also constituted teams to check for any violations but it seems all measures have fallen short.When the issue was brought to the notice of district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey he said that he would be deploying a team to nab the violators.

4am-7am: A walk can run you out,"Chandigarh: Stepping out for an early morning walk might be doing some damage to your health instead of keeping you fit! The air in the city has been more polluted between 4 am and 7 am than some of the other hours in the last few days, according to data collected by Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC).The Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAAQMS) at Panjab University, Sector 25, is giving real time monitoring data after every hour. The analysis of data revealed that the air quality index (AQI) at 4 am on October 11 was 106. It went up to 145 at 4am on Tuesday. Similarly, the AQI at 7am on October 11 was 103, and increased to 141 at the same time on Tuesday. /On the other hand, the AQI at 8pm on October 11 was 102 and at 1 pm on October 13 93.T C Nautiyal, member secretary, CPCC, said he would first cross-check AQI figures of the Sector 25 station with others and then comment. Experts blamed dip in temperatures and stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana for the cloud of smoke enveloping the city from dawn - a reason Nautiyal agreed with. ""Rise in stubble burning cases in Punjab and Haryana will definitely pollute city's air in the coming days as well The UT administration will soon hold a meeting with its counterparts in Punjab and Haryana on the issue,"" he said. Residents too are feeling the change in the air.Seema, a resident of Sector 39, said she is regular walker but has started facing some breathing problems during the morning hours. She has now started going to a gym instead of a walk in the neighbourhood park.At present, the UT does not have any data to quantify proportion of various elements to the overall level of pollution. It had decided to conduct a source appointment study to help it prepare data to quantify proportion of various elements to the overall level of air pollution. But the administration rejected the proposal because of its high cost last year. In 2017, the environment department representatives held a meeting with officials of Union environment ministry in which it was discussed that IIT, Kanpur, had procured Switzerland-made monitoring devices worth Rs 5 crore each to conduct the study in four different cities. As the cost was very high, the proposal was then turned down. Now, UT administration would float a tender to carry out the study.Box:SMOKY MORNINGSTIME | AQI (October 11)4am | 1065am | 1056am | 1047am | 10311am | 1028pm | 1029pm 101TIME | AQI (October 12)4am | 1045am | 1066am | 1067am | 1077pm | 104 10pm | 10311pm | 101TIME | AQI (October 13)4am | 995am | 986am | 977am | 961pm | 934pm | 905pm | 92TIME | AQI (October 14)4am | 1255am | 1276am | 1297am | 130TIME | AQI (October 15)4am | 1455am | 1446am | 1437am | 1411pm | 1344 pm | 1355pm | 1356pm | 137AQI | Remarks |Health impacts0-50 Good | Minimal | Impact51-100 | Satisfactory | Minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people101-200 | Moderate | Breathing discomfort to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases201-300 | Poor | Breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure301-400 Very poor | Respiratory illness on prolonged exposure401-500 | Severe | Affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Waste burnt on Ghaziabad plot for 10 days, no action taken","Ghaziabad: The implementation of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) measures in Ghaziabad seems to have gone up in smoke hardly a day after they were put in place in the district. Tonnes of garbage in a vacant plot between Hindon canal road and Pusta road have been set on fire, and smoke has been billowing from the site for the past 10 days, residents said. No government department or agency seems to have taken note so far.The area is not very populous - barring some farmhouses and wedding halls, there are several open fields and vacant plots. /This has made it easy for trucks to dump garbage under cover of night. They set the accumulated waste on fire to make space for more trash.

Bhopal turns into dust bowl,"Bhopal: After rains, the residents of the state capital are faced with broken roads and dust. Both pollution level and the number of patients for respiratory ailments have gone up in city due to dust flying over broken roads and dried potholes.Data provided by the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) for the month of October points out that pollution levels are higher than normal. Air pollution is measured by taking into account the level of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air.While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage, among others. /PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity as well as climatic conditions.Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to human health since it causes severe lung diseases. For Bhopal, values of PM 10 and PM 2.5 are above normal while SO2 and Nox limits are still under the permissible limits, which imply that construction work and bad roads are adding more to the pollution compared to emissions from vehicles. The city's ambient air quality is measured at six places, including Paryavaran Parisar (residential), Bairagarh (commercial), Govindpura (industrial), Kolar (residential), Hamidia Road (commercial) and Hoshangabad Road (commercial).The value of PM 10 should be under 100, but it was 106.7 in Paryavaran Parisar on October 9. In Bairagarh, it was above the normal mark for four out of total five times measured in the month. In Govindpura, too, the value of PM10 was much above the normal mark for the three times it was measured in the month. In Kolar, it was more for all the three times measured in the month. Similarly, on Hoshangabad Road also, the value of PM10 was above the normal mark.Value of PM 2.5 was also above normal mark in Paryavaran Parisar, Govindpura, Kolar and Hoshangabad road. To measure pollution levels, PCB officials said a respirable dust sampler instrument is used. For calculating PM-10 (respirable particulate matter) and PM 2.5, filter paper and cyclone are used with the help of which dust particles are measured. The presence of sulphur dioxide is measured with absorbent solution. Overall, the air quality of Bhopal ranged between satisfactory to moderate.MPPCB regional officer, AA Mishra, said the air pollution level goes up due to dust and the same is reflected in the air pollution figures this month.Rising pollution level is triggering severe respiratory ailments. Dr PN Agrawal, DM in pulmonary and critical care medicine, told TOI that at least 5,000 patients visit hospitals every day for respiratory ailments due to pollution and the number is rising. Dust exposure leads to allergies, respiratory infection and other diseases.MPPCB experts pointed out that green cover and plantation help keep pollution levels under check. The central verge on roads, in particular, with plants that are 5 feet in height help curb air pollution.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'No agency has real-time data on pollution source',"New Delhi: Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday blamed stubble burning in neighbouring states for the deteriorating air pollution in the capital and stressed that the air quality was better for over eight months before stubble burning started. ""Delhi has become a gas chamber due to pollution from stubble burning in the neighbouring states. A comprehensive winter action plan has been prepared by the Delhi government. /The odd-even scheme is aimed at limiting the emission by vehicles in the air over that period,"" said Kejriwal, adding that the air quality is not going to improve unless the external causes of pollution are addressed.Kejriwal dismissed claims of a Central agency that farm stubble burning in neighbouring states was contributing only 10% to Delhi's pollution. ""We respect all experts, but the people of Delhi alone cannot be blamed for the pollution; it is through their efforts that the pollution has reduced by 25%,"" the CM said. ""Various reports have come from different perspectives; some of them are based on old data,"" he added.""No agency has real-time data. If we decide causes of pollution in October 2019, based on the data in 2017 or 2018, it won't be correct.""Kejriwal said the 25% reduction in pollution was due to harsh measures taken by people of Delhi. ""We need to do much more, but unless there are efforts to tackle the smoke due to crop burning in neighbouring states, Delhi's problems will continue,"" he said.He stated that it is almost impossible to assess the break-up of impact of both internal and external sources of pollution in Delhi with the existing technology. Real-time source apportionment of pollution would be possible from next April for which a centre has been set up near India Gate in collaboration with the Washington University. ""From next April, we'll be able to provide the details of air pollution and sources in an interval of every four hours. That's real-time monitoring,"" the C M said.""To fight pollution, our government has banned use of DG sets, started hotspot monitoring, announced dust control measures and formed teams for keeping vigil on the construction activities and to stop garbage burning."" The Aam Aadmi Party government is also exploring the option of staggering the office timings. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Crop burning, wind flow blamed as air quality sinks to 'very poor'","Noida/Ghaziabad: In a massive overnight deterioration of air quality in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad, all pollution monitoring stations across the three cities slipped to the 'red' zone on Wednesday, which marks 'very poor' levels. At 339, Ghaziabad was the second-most polluted city among 104 in the country, according to SAMEER app of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change. Until Tuesday, all stations were in the 'orange' zone, or 'poor' levels, save one in Ghaziabad that was in 'red' zone.The India Meterological Department has attributed the dip in air quality to a rise in stubble burning in Pakistan, Haryana and Punjab, while the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) blamed weather conditions. /It is a precursor to the 'severe' mark when all stringent graded response action plan (GRAP) measures come into effect.While on Wednesday, the AQI was recorded at 327 and 305 in Noida and Greater Noida, respectively, from Tuesday's levels of 297 and 302, respectively, it climbed to 339 in Ghaziabad, the second highest among 104 cities. Panipat in Haryana was India's most polluted city, with an AQI of 340.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.In fact, the decline in ambient air quality in the three cities has been marked by an increase by 28 to 72 points at the pollution monitoring stations. The fastest decline has been seen at Ghaziabad's Sanjay Nagar station, where the AQI rose sharply from Tuesday's 302 to 374 on Wednesday.GRAP measures to curb air pollution include increasing bus and metro services, hiking parking fees and stopping use of diesel gensets when the air quality turns 'poor'. When it turns 'severe', GRAP suggests closure of brick kilns, sprinkling of water, frequent mechanised road cleaning and maximising power generation from natural gas. Authorities blame stubble burning as well as slow wind-movement for the worsening of air quality in these three cities. The wind coming from east of Delhi has a speed of about 10 kmph. ""The stubble burning counts have increased in Punjab and Haryana, and Pakistan, so the smoke is flowing towards NCR like every year. The wind speed locally too is low, which has led to a lack of dispersion of the incoming polluted winds,"" Anil Singh, regional officer of UPPCB, told TOI.According to a forecast by the IMD, the AQI may slightly improve on Thursday and Friday, but it would remain in the 'poor' category. ""We are keeping a close watch on the ground level pollution as well and all stringent GRAP measures will be in place as soon as AQI crosses 'severe' mark,"" Singh said.(With inputs from Abhijay Jha) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Out of breath: Paddy, festival season spoil city's air quality","Ludhiana: With paddy harvesting on and Diwali a fortnight away, there has been a substantial fall in city's air quality. The pollution levels have almost doubled in the past one week.On Wednesday, the Air Quality Index (a measure of air pollution) was in the poor category for the city. The AQI value includes a combination of many air pollutants, including respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and sulphur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, benzene and xylene, among others.As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin of AQI values for various cities released at 4pm on Wednesday, Ludhiana's was recorded at 193, which comes under moderate category. /It was the highest in the state, with Amritsar, Bathinda, Jalandhar, Khanna and Mandi Gobindgarh at 134, 106, 188, 116 and 95, respectively. The possible health impact of this AQI includes breathing discomfort to people with lung and heart diseases and asthma. At 6pm Wednesday, the average AQI value was 203, which falls in poor category with health impacts like breathing discomfort to most people at prolonged exposure. The maximum particulate matter (PM) 2.5 was 305.PPCB chairman Satwinder Marwaha said they were aware of the high AQI and would take steps to check it. He added that they have been creating awareness among farmers on stubble burning and as part of the drive, they had taken services of NSS volunteers too.About Diwali's effect on air, he said the government has notified timings for bursting of crackers and the PPCB was regularly monitoring the environment and would issue challans to violators.Last year on October 16, the AQI was 143. The same day in 2017, it was recorded at a whopping 249.However, the green activists are worried. ""There is a need to carry out education meetings with farmers to check stubble burning.

Spectre of illegal firecrackers looms on city in run-up to Diwali,"Kolkata: In the run-up to Diwali that is just 10 days away, the spectre of pollution, both noise and air, the city reels under the scare of pollution, both air and noise, with majority of firework manufacturers having no license and complying with no rule at Nungi and Champahati. These two major fireworks manufacturing hubs in the city have a few hundred units. While Nungi has 23 licensed units, there is not a single licensed one in Champahati. /The fireworks that are manufactured on the outskirts of Kolkata and enter the city markets easily cause irreparable damage to air along with noise pollution. The pollutants in the air refuse to disperse till there is a dramatic change in the weather. Meanwhile, inversion of temperature has also kept the particles hanging low.""We know the problem, so we want the manufacturers to comply with the rules. If they comply with the rule, they can avoid any harassment by enforcement agencies. Moreover, the environment will be the biggest beneficiary. We are urging people to inform us about such illegal manufacturers through the Paribesh App. We will reward such citizens,"" said West Bengal Pollution Control Board member secretary, Dr Rajesh Kumar.There is a stricter noise norms in Kolkata as far as the decibel level of fireworks is concerned - 90 dB(A) at 5 meters from source, while it is 125 dB(A) in rest of India. The city underrates air pollution, particularly heavy metal pollution during Kali Puja and Diwali. A few days ago, Centre had announced the introduction of low emission fireworks, which reduce the pollution by 30%. But such low emission fireworks are absent in Kolkata, said environment activist, Somendra Mohan Ghosh.Some of the major pollutants like nitrogen oxide give rise to several respiratory diseases, lung problems, eye irritation and sometimes cause heart failure, warned Dr Asim Chakraborty, a pulmonologist. Chairman of the West Bengal Fire Crackers Development Association, Babla Roy, said they were ready to adhere to the guidelines of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) to keep the sound limit up to 90 decibel. But the onus is on the manufacturers who are not ready with environment friendly fireworks. ""There are certain chemicals used for manufacturing fireworks, which have been banned. I don't know if it is possible to produce crackers without those,"" he added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Youths discourage use of crackers for a cause,"The Supreme Court had banned the sale of firecrackers in Delhi in 2017. Ever since, youngsters have taken it upon themselves to celebrate an eco-friendly Diwali in Patna. The sales of crackers have decreased considerably in various parts of Bihar. Patnaites are determined to celebrate the festival in a pollution-free way. /Some of them also want to celebrate it with simplicity because the city has yet not recovered from the recent natural disaster. Youths discourage the use of crackersThough a variety of new crackers are ruling the market, several youngsters have decided to go the eco-friendly way. Mohit Raj, a college student, said, ""My elder brother, Kartik Raj, and I have said 'no' to crackers since last year. We have to understand that air pollution damages our ozone layer, but people do not take it seriously. Parents too spend unnecessarily on these crackers for their children's happiness. But youngsters like us have to take the initiative to save our environment.""Pollution-free DiwaliYoung Patnaites are very much concerned about the increasing pollution level in the city. Shravan Kumar, an intermediate student, said, ""Pollution of any kind is a serious threat for society. During Diwali, there is an increase in pollution level that ultimately harms us. In order to save our society, I want to encourage everyone to stop bursting firecrackers. Already, city people are suffering from various diseases, which is the result of a high-pollution level post flood.""Use money for a good causeA few youngsters, who are already engaged in serving the flood-hit victims, believe that instead of wasting money on crackers, it should be used for a good cause. Prabha Singh, a college student and a blogger, said, ""I request the school and college students not to waste their parents' money in buying firecrackers, which will just harm our environment. My friends and I will buy food packets, sanitary napkins and clothes for those flood-victims who are still fighting with the situation. I want to make their Diwali a bit better.""Sale of shopkeepers affectedHowever, this initiative will adversely affect the revenue of several shopkeepers and traders who are engaged in the cracker business. Raju, a local shopkeeper at Anishabad, said, ""Diwali is the only time when I make some extra bucks by selling crackers. But this year, I am not very confident about the sales. Many people have spent a lot in renovating their houses after flood. They may not waste money on crackers. Besides, youngsters these days are also very particular about celebrating eco-friendly Diwali. Therefore, this year I will sell less of crackers and more of trendy diyas and decorative materials.""

City's air quality dips to its worst this season,"Chandigarh: The city's air quality which till date has been ""moderate"" - can cause breathing discomfort to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases - is now inching towards the ""poor"" category under which there can be breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure.On Wednesday, the air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 177, which is just 23 points away from the ""poor"" category. On October 1, the AQI was 58.In 15 days only, the city's air has turned from ""satisfactory"" to ""moderate"".

I will get it checked with my team,"" said Nautiyal.The Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAAQMS) at Panjab University, Sector 25, is giving real time monitoring data after every hour.At present, the UT does not have any data to quantify proportion of various elements to the overall level of pollution. /It had decided to conduct a source appointment study to help it prepare data to quantify proportion of various elements to the overall level of air pollution. But the administration rejected the proposal because of its high cost last year. In 2017, the environment department representatives held a meeting with officials of Union environment ministry in which it was discussed that IIT, Kanpur, had procured Switzerland-made monitoring devices worth Rs 5 crore each to conduct the study in four different cities. As the cost was very high, the proposal was then turned down. Now, UT administration would float a tender to carry out the study.Tracking pollutionTIME | AQI6am | 1517am | 1518am | 1519am | 15110am | 15211am | 15312noon | 1551pm | 1592pm | 1623pm | 1664pm | 1695pm| 1716pm | 1737pm | 176Box: What is AQIAQI can be termed as the numerical scale used generally to assess the air quality with regard to human health and the environment. It is used by various agencies to assess the quality of air in a particular region on a daily basis. The main focus of the AQI is to calculate the effects of the air in a particular region to the health of the people breathing it. The AQI mainly looks for major pollution causing factors in the air. They include particulate matter, ground-level ozone, sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) among others. Generally, a higher number in the AQI scale is seen as a higher pollution level and health risk in comparison to lower numbers that point to lesser health risk.Box:The UT administration has decided to set up two more continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMSs) in sectors 26 and 50, receiving funds under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). The city has at the moment one real-time monitoring station at Sector 25, Panjab University (PU). It was inaugurated by Punjab governor-cum-UT administrator V P Singh Badnore on July 16. The station is providing information regarding the ambient air quality along with individual readings of eight parameters.Box: In list of 100 citiesThe Union government had recently fixed a target for pollution reduction. The UT administration decided to prepare a comprehensive action plan. Chandigarh is in the list of 100 cities identified on the basis of level of pollutants such as NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 by the central government for pollution reduction. The government aims at cutting pollution level by 35% in the next three years and 50% by the next five years For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Kanjikode: Steel smelting units to be examined,"Palakkad: The Kerala state pollution control board (KSPCB) has inspected 15 steel rerolling mills in Kanjikode industrial area on the allegation of serious air pollution from these factories. It is found that in the area, these steel units lack proper pollution control measures and people living here have been suffering from health problems.The district environment engineer of KSPCB, M N Krishnan said that more than 15 steel companies lack proper pollution control measures. /He said that the night inspections of these companies are also going on to find out about the complaint of air pollution from these units.K Ayyapan of Koyyamarakkad said that though his house is one kilometre away from the steel factories and near the railway track, the smoke with the smell of burning of rubber had reached his house leading to suffocation.Another resident of Koyyamarakkad, R Krishnaswamy, said that during the night, due to the polluted air, sleeping is very difficult. Since he is a heart patient breathing has become difficult.Nearly 20 people in the area developed health problems during the last two days allegedly due to the polluted air, the local people said. Women and children also experienced health problems and suffocation from the foul smell of the air coming out from the industrial units. Some people had also vomitted. The smoke had also spread to the national highway passing through the area.Meanwhile the Kanjikode Paristhithi Samrakshana Samithi had demanded the closing down of the polluting steel smelting units since it is affecting thousands of people living near the Kanjikode industrial area.

Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to monitor air quality week before and after Diwali,"MUMBAI: In a first, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) will monitor air quality a week before and after Diwali to understand the composition of dust and emissions from firecrackers./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/On Friday, the MPCB decided to ban three crackers for violating peak noise levels, containing barium nitrate and emitting thick smoke. Along with NGO Awaaz Foundation, MPCB tested 29 crackers, including the recently developed green crackers, on Chembur's RCF ground.The highest decibel level-126dB-was recorded by a 16-sky shot cracker called Crackling Delight. ""People are unaware of the adverse health effects some firecrackers have as they contain hazardous chemicals, like mercury and lead, which cause brain damage among children,"" said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation.The green cracker (Pogoo) recorded 108.3dB. While the green crackers were noisy, activists root for them as they will help reduce air pollution. ""But green crackers should try to eliminate sulfur,"" said Abdulali, adding that she will test the banned crackers in a private laboratory for chemical composition and also write to police to confiscate them.MPCB will monitor air quality in two phases across 18 cities-from October 20-27 and October 28-November 3. ""We will be able to compare the air pre-Diwali and post-Diwali and understand the impact of the emissions from firecrackers,"" said V M Motghare, joint director (air quality), MPCB.

Track the pollution level in your city,AQI unlikely to improve this winter in Kolkata,"KOLKATA: The delay in implementation of action plan against city's growing air pollution is unlikely to give relief to citizens from foul air this winter, felt environmentalists. The air quality in Kolkata turns vicious in winter, when breathing air causes more damage than smoking cigarettes./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/National Environment Engineering Research Institue (NEERI) interim source apportionment study indicated that reduction in vehicular emission and street-side food vendors switching to cleaner fuel would reduce emission burden of the city drastically. These two sources contribute more than 50% of particulate pollution (PM2.5 and PM10).""The process of facilitating the switchover to cleaner fuel is yet to begin. It will take at least a year to implement. So, the pollution burden is unlikely to reduce this winter,"" said environment crusader Subhas Datta, who had moved NGT on the city's declining air quality way back in 2014. According to him, the process should have started a year ago.The environment department is yet to address vehicular pollution in general and diesel exhaust in particular, which is the second biggest contributor to city's particulate pollution, said another environment activist. ""Eighty electric buses do not come to any quantifiable percentage of the city's mammoth diesel fleet. The government has failed miserably to make coal belt methane (CBM), available in abundance in Asansol and Ranigunj, a clean fuel available in the city as an alternative to diesel,"" said Datta.In absence of CNG or CBM, the government could use biodiesel, which is produced by at least three city-based companies, to bring down the particulate pollution. ""City's diesel fleet can mix 20% bio-fuel or bio-diesel (extracted from oilseeds) at depot level to bring down the particulate pollution,"" said Dr Prabir Basu, an auto emission expert. The state government can also think of installing air ioniser at key crossings, added auto emission consultant Somendra Mohan Ghosh.""The government's efforts are fraught with inaction and non-compliances of NGT orders. So far, the government has failed to take any suo motu action on pollution. All its actions are driven by court verdicts. Even then, implementation of an action plan takes long. There should be a study on how inaction is forcing citizens to spend through their nose for healthcare. The collective cost must be mind-blowing,"" said Datta. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Track the pollution level in your city,Lens on sound pollution shifts focus away from polluting cracker smoke,"Kolkata: Though the city is heading towards its noisiest festival - Kali Puja-Diwali - the noise pollution isn't the only problem. The smoke from the crackers irreversibly pollutes the air, which remains toxic as winter approaches. ""Kali Puja-Diwali are the nights of worst air pollution. /But we have no option but to contain the noise pollution and overlook the air pollution,"" said a West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) official. The fireworks always come with massive heavy-metal pollution, which often prove dangerous to human health. More colourful the fireworks, higher the heavy-metal pollution. As the crackers light up the sky, the heavy metals settle low in the atmosphere, rapidly degrading the air quality.Last year, WBPCB's reading showed that on the night of Kali Puja on November 6, the concentration of PM10 rose to 800g/m3, eight times the permissible limit and the PM2.5 count rose to 656g/m3, more than 10 times the permissible limit. On Diwali the next night, the PM10 rose to an alarming 1,727g/m3 and the PM2.5 rose to 1,120g/m3. Even on the day of Kali Puja immersion, the pollution remained very high with indiscriminate bursting of firecrackers. The PM10 count rose to 1,250g/m3 and the PM2.5 touched 225g/m3.Spiking of PM10 and PM2.5 count is the biggest concern for Kolkata, say experts. The PM2.5 particles - with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres - go straight to the blood stream through the lungs. By way of comparison, a human hair is 100 micrometres in diameter and can accommodate roughly 40 PM2.5 particles across its width. ""The city's ambient air quality does not recover from the jolt it suffers during the Kali Puja-Diwali nights. It keeps worsening as the days progress into winter. With the inversion of temperature, the pollutants don't disperse and hang heavy in the lower strata of atmosphere. This is the time when morning air becomes poisonous to breathe in,"" said Dr Anirban Das, a respiratory medicine expert.Over the years, the air becomes so foul after Diwali that Kolkata turns into one of the worst polluted cities in the world, often exceeding the pollution level of Delhi, which is arguably the worst polluted city in the world.

Bhalswa landfill fire back and staring in face of agencies fighting pollution,"New Delhi: After staying dormant for several months, the Bhalswa landfill got reignited on Sunday. At a time when the Graded Response Action Plan is in force in Delhi-NCR and various agencies are purportedly cracking down on the sources of air pollution, Bhalswa remains more than just an eyesore, pumping thick plumes of smoke and carcinogenic toxins into Delhi's air. The fire, which started on Sunday afternoon, continued till into the night. /At 5pm, when TOI visited the site, a large section of the landfill towards Jahangirpuri was still ablaze and the smoke was visible from several kilometres away on GT Karnal Road.Varsha Joshi, commissioner of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, told TOI: ""A team from the civic body is on the job and the fire will be put out within a couple of hours. It's a difficult spot to reach because of the steep slope, or else the fire would have been controlled long before it became visible.""Delhi produces around 10,000MT of garbage every day, a majority of which is dumped at the Bhalswa, Ghazipur and Okhla landfills, which have exhausted their capacity way back. The mountains of waste produce combustible methane gas, which often catches fire. The toxic fumes thus generated are a poisonous cocktail of particulate matter mixed with carbon-dioxide, carbon-monoxide, hydrogen-sulphide, carcinogenic dioxins and furans. ""The Bhalswa landfill was exhausted in 2007 itself, but dumping of waste continues as no alternative site has been allotted to us,"" a north corporation official said. In fact, it was exactly a year ago that a fire had erupted at this landfill and raged on for four days. However, the number of fires at Bhalswa had come down significantly in the last few months ever since the corporation started work on slope stabilisation towards Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar. But the other side remains difficult to reach. A fire department official confirmed Joshi's assertion that the terrain was tough to negotiate. ""The steep vertical surface makes these sites almost inaccessible. The sources of these fires are 10-20m below the surface. Using water only aggravates the problem as it affects the landfill's stability,"" the official said.The civic bodies are currently undertaking a Rs 250-crore project for bio-mining and bio-remediation of the three landfill sites with the ultimate goal of flattening the mounds. North corporation will install a fourth trammel machine near Bhalswa landfill on Monday. The latest fire only highlights the need to expedite the project. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Deepavali: City forced into walking Green Mile,"New Delhi: With green crackers still a scarce commodity and there being just 2,000 pre-decided community spots where they can be burst - at least legally - this year's Diwali celebrations are likely to be a muted affair. That actually may not be such a bad thing, considering that the focus may shift to Diwali melas and club-based activities, as plans shared with TOI by several prominent RWAs revealed. The much-needed respite for Delhi's air couldn't be that bad a thing - the AQI reading on Monday was 249 (poor), but Siri Fort's 663 (severe) pointed to the danger ahead. That said, there is a sense of resentment among people over the continued unavailability of green crackers, touted as the solution to a pollution-free Diwali, even a year after Supreme Court ordered a crackdown on fireworks.RWAs claimed that Diwali could be a damp squib this time around, but saw a silver lining. /Sudha Sinha, member of Federation of Cooperative Group Housing Societies (CGHS) Dwarka, said while green crackers were still not easily available, the idea of community celebrations hadn't caught up either. ""Last year too, the community spots had failed to attract crowds. People limited themselves to bursting whatever little crackers they could get hold of. This year, we expect even less of that,"" she said. The situation had brought about positive social changes too, she conceded. ""It's definitely going to be a different Diwali,"" she said. The mood was festive in Greater Kailash where people sought to make the most of the compulsions. Chetan Sharma, general secretary of Confederation of NCR RWA Association (CONRWA), said the city was moving towards more traditional ways of celebrating the festival of lights. ""We have already made rounds of Diwali melas in our area. The constant spotlight on air pollution has made people more aware and not many may go out of their way to procure firecrackers illegally,"" Sharma said. ""RWAs are focusing on flower- and rangoli-based decorations. Unlike last year when the ban was announced at short notice, the preparation has been better this time around and it's likely to be more effective,"" he said.Jasbir Chaddha, a member of United Residents Joint Action (URJA) and resident East of Kailash, agreed that the awareness levels among the general population was significantly higher. ""There is always a minuscule number of people who are mischief makers. But a majority of residents, especially schoolkids and youths, are more aware than ever,"" he said. But Chaddha thinks that community spots for bursting firecrackers are a bad idea. ""This will be a complete failure. People celebrate Diwali with their families,"" he said. TOI caught up with some residents of Khirki Extension in south Delhi. There too, the overwhelming sentiment was of welcoming the change. According to a local NGO, Apeksha Society, the low availability of green crackers could be a boon in more ways than one. ""We will decorate our houses with lights and lamps. With non-polluting crackers hardly available in the market, the idea is to keep it simple. It will also help people save money,"" said Dinesh Awasthi, president of the society.Harjinder Singh Saroha, vice-chairperson, Sector-C Vasant Kunj Federation, said Diwali would be more about melas and get-togethers this time. ""Most people are now concerned about the air we are breathing,"" he said. Many RWAs in east Delhi, however, remained sceptical about the how the ban on firecrackers would be enforced. BS Vohra, who heads East Delhi RWA Joint Front, said: ""Every year, the promises go up in smoke around 9pm on Diwali. We don't have a system in place to plug such leaks. While awareness levels have increased, the reality will be known only on Diwali night."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
You can burst crackers only for 2hours on Diwali,"Puducherry: Bursting of firecrackers will be permitted only for two hours - from 6am to 7am and from 8pm to 9pm on Deepavali day in the Union territory of Puducherry, as per the directions of the Supreme Court.A release from the department of science, technology and environment and Puducherry pollution control committee said the government has completely prohibited bursting firecrackers at any time in silence zones, i.e. within 100m around hospitals, religious places, educational institutions and court buildings.""Crackers spoil our environment by causing noise and air pollution and adversely affect our health.

In Delhi, the AQI was recorded at 249, while in Ghaziabad it was 284, in Greater Noida it was 243. Faridabad and Noida too recorded the AQI in the 'poor' category at 216 and 260 respectively. /<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/""Due to rising smoke from neighbouring states and low wind speed, the particulate matters are stuck in the lower atmosphere. Light rain on Saturday brought down the pollution levels marginally in Delhi-NCR. However, it rose immediately since the weather conditions were adverse on Sunday and Monday,"" said an official of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB). According to the Met Department, the air quality is expected to worsen after Tuesday. ""Since strong surface winds are expected on Tuesday the air quality will be better, but henceforth the wind speed is set to decline resulting in the dip in air quality in the city. The situation may worsen post Diwali,"" a Met department official said. However, experts blamed the authorities for ignoring the factors resulting in the rise in pollution levels. ""We understand that election is an important responsibility for officials in a democracy, but it is equally important for them to fight air pollution, especially during Diwali. The authorities have not adopted a single significant measure to combat air pollution. While Delhi is using dust suppressants, the city is still dependent on traditional ways of water sprinkling. There is absolutely no check on illegal construction activities and waste dumping. If it continues, the air pollution will soon touch the 'very poor' mark,"" said Debjani Ghosh, a former environmental engineer. According to the SAFAR forecast, the AQI in the city will be in the 'poor' category till Wednesday. On Monday, a drop of about two notches was recorded in the maximum and minimum temperature.

Track the pollution level in your city,Housing complex residents vow to follow noise rules on Diwali,"Kolkata: Residents of high-rises, who have hitherto been accused of grossly violating the ban on high-decibel firecrackers, have sworn to comply with the city's noise norms this time. Their promise came after the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) announced strict action would be taken against rule violators. However, not everyone is convinced about compliance to the rules against noise and air pollution.Most housing complex residents have vowed to comply with the PCB-prescribed rules and many of the residents' welfare association secretaries have issued notices to residents warning them of serious consequences if any violation of the norms happened during Diwali. /However, some of the associations admitted that a section of residents don't pay heed to any warning and continue bursting high-decibel crackers.The WBPCB on Sunday said the secretary and president of each housing society will be liable for any violation of noise norm. Ever since, there have been hectic activities at high rises on preventing the violation of norms. ""I have told the residents that I will single out the violators if police arrive after receiving any complaint,"" said the secretary of an east Kolkata housing complex welfare association.

Dakshindari potters rue bad business of diyas,"Though Diwali is known as the Festival of Lights, for third-generation potter and diya maker Kalachand Paul, the brightness has dimmed and the buzz surrounding the occasion has died down. The reason? Just like several other families who once had a thriving diya-making business in the city, Kalachand's life too took a 360-degree turn eight years ago. /Curbing pollution The potters in the city were forced to leave Kolkata around eight years ago and settle in a place called Dakshindari in the suburbs. This was part of a move to reduce pollution in the city. Several kilns , which were used to bake the clay diyas, emitted smoke that caused air pollution and were shut down. ""We can't make diyas anymore in the city. Once a clay diya is made, it is left to dry under the sun and then we need a furnace to bake it in a wooden oven. This used to emit a lot of smoke that was causing pollution. Seeing this, we were asked to leave the city if we wanted to continue our business. We had no other option but to leave, since making diyas and other clay items is the only skillset we have,"" rued Kalachand. Dwindling business This move has not only taken a toll on their business, as the sale has reduced drastically, but a lot of logistical issues have also cropped up. They used to source the clay required to make the diyas from the ghats of Kumartuli and Baghbazar. But after moving to the outskirts, they have to use the clay from nearby villages to avoid transportation problems. Nowadays, the clay from the ghats too carry a lot of pollutants and synthetic waste. Apart from Bengal, these diyas are sent to states like Jharkhand, Bihar and Assam. Throwing light on their situation, another potter, Chandan Projapati, shared, ""We have an autonomous organisation of potters settled in Dakshindari and on the 15th of every month we meet to share our grievances with the heads of the committee. There's no security in our lives and neither do we earn enough to make ends meet. We have been making diyas for generations. But now, citing pollution, we have been shifted to the outskirts. Even during this time of the year, business is not good. We have been requesting the heads of the committee to put forth our concerns to the higher authorities in the administration but to no avail."" Striving for innovation Apart from clay diyas, the potters make colourful and intricately decorated ones too. Ahead of Diwali, businessmen from Kolkata come down to Dakshindari and buy these diyas in bulk. The amount the potters charge is `300 for a pack of 1,000 diyas. ""The diyas are sold at almost double the price in the wholesale markets in Kolkata. Say, for 1,000 diyas, the businessmen will charge `500-`600. Many businessmen from Barasat and other places also bring us unfinished diyas bought in wholesale. We, in turn, polish, paint and again sell these back to them at a reasonable price after proper packaging,"" said Chandan.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Kolkatans walk for cracker-free Diwali,"KOLKATA: Hundreds of children, youth, government officials and active citizens from all walks of life came together to share the true essence of festivals in our lives and create awareness on the harmful effects of bursting fire crackers, now that winter and the festive season has set in.Participants requested Kolkatans to 'say no to firecrackers' and aspire for pollution-free options like diyas and lights, and join for a cleaner, greener and joyful festivities.This march was organised by 'Kolkata Clean Air', an initiative of Active Citizens Together for Sustainability (ACTS) - a citizen and community-led initiative is a conglomerate of many organisations and active citizens with a vision to make Kolkata one of the most liveable and climate friendly cities in the world. The walk started from Elgin Road, and ended in front of Elliot Park. Citizens marching carried various cloth banners with messages including - 'Be part of solution, not pollution"" and ""Don't smoke your future"".Bursting firecrackers may seem like a small action, but statistically leads to a significant increase in air pollution. It plays a large role in deteriorating air quality post festivals where cities across India are deteriorated to such a level that the area has been referred to as a ""Gas Chamber"". Kolkata air pollution is one of the worst in the world. /It is reported that we are breathing poison and Kolkata becomes a gas chamber every winter and it is worseing every year. Youth carried banners highlighting the hazardous impact of air pollution - which is widely acknoledged as a invisible killer.Firecrackers after its invention in China has found its place in India's festivities - unfortunately they only lead to environment destruction, encourage child labour, becomes a fire hazard, pollute our waters, negatively affect our animals and the mental health of our vulnerable citizens. All of this while leaving the city gasping for breadth in the extremely hazardous air due to the dangerous metals and pollutants that are realised - that have a long lasting health impact fail for our children and elderly. Its not a tradition to burst firecrackers, its a modern day invention.Speaking at the event, Vinay Jaju, co-founder, SwitchON foundation and ACTS said, ""The heavy smoke combined with the noise pollution are some of the long-term effects of the temporary celebration. It would be a shame on our generation if we can't allow our children to enjoy Diwali in its true glory. The day should bring families and humanity together, and not illness, bad health, suffering of animals and environment destruction.""The bursting of crackers during festivals is primarily responsible for an increase in concentration of dust and pollutants. The fine dust that settles after bursting crackers is rich in pollutants like oxides of sulphur and nitrogen, metal dust and organic pollutants. Exposure to such toxic air is extremely dangerous for our citizens and this can amount to a serious public health crisis. The particulate matter released by firecrackers enter our lungs and blood stream making is extremely dangerous.University of Chicago says particulate air pollution is the single greatest threat to human health globally.Lata Bhatia Co Founder of ACTS ""A few hours of fun for a few will make air quality of the city hazardous for the next few months for everyone, especially affecting the babies, the already sick and our seniors. We must take responsibility of our actions"".Last year during Diwali and Kali puja, the air quality across Kolkata was over 500 AQI, 20 times higher than safe levels prescribed by World Health Organization (WHO) and was the worst across metro cities across Kolkata.Sandip Ranjan Bakshi of ward no -72 said, ""According to the rules of Supreme Court, the intensity of sound must not exceed 60 decibels. Enjoy Kali Puja, Durga Puja and other festivals ensuring that no accidents take place following these. All of us have to keep that in mind and move forward.""Ashim Kumar Bose of ward 70 said, ""The less firecrackers we use, the more we prove ourselves to be more responsible towards the society.""There is another side-effect that is completely ignored. Rising anxiety levels because of firecrackers pose a serious threat to people dealing with mental health issues. Virtually, every organ in the body is at risk from bursting firecrackers.According to the scientists at CPCB, a major constituent of the smog that forms on bursting of firecrackers and hangs over the city like an impenetrable cloak for days after Diwali. Crackers are injurious to senior citizens and children's health. It is not only injurious to humans, but also for animals and birds. Animals whose ears are more sensitive such as dogs and cats get afraid and often lose their hearing ability. Vijay Agarwal, co-founder of ACTS said, ""Winter is setting in and so the Pollution level will also rise tremendously during winter season. Kolkata and other parts of northern India are already under smog cover from last few days.""But the march was not just about highlighting the crisis, but focussed on the solutions to the problem. Kush Modi of Don Bosco School who has pledged to not burst any crackers said, ""Let there be no smoke, no sound but lots of fun, let's properly welcome the festival of lights.""Children and adults, both alike took up pledges to not burst crackers this festive season and find alternative ways to enjoy the festivals with their friends and family.As a closing remark Ajay Mittal, co-founder ACTS said, ""It's important to light up our minds, and and find different ways of doing things in the face of the climate crisis we face. If you change nothing today, nothing will change tomorrow. The time to make a difference is now.""It's a new beginning and will go a long way to lighting up the minds of the generations to come.

Green crackers to light up this Diwali in Thiruvananthapuram,"The festival of lights is around the corner and despite the Supreme Court prescribing norms, how can Diwali celebrations be complete without the bursting of crackers and enjoying the fun of sparklers and flowerpots? But if the thought of smoke and emissions bother you, there is good news. After Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan recently launched an initiative to promote 'green crackers' to curb air pollution, the State capital too, can easily make the switch to eco-friendly crackers, being brought from Sivakasi, which houses the biggest fireworks manufacturing industry in the country. And the sporadic rain is not proving a damper, as sales on green flowerpots, pencils, chakras and sparklers is heating up. /""The green crackers come with an assurance that they are less harmful and 30% more pollution-free than the conventional ones. But the fact that these are now available needs to be marketed better by the authorities and government,"" says Sudhakar M B, who owns a firecracker shop at Chenthitta in Thiruvananthapuram.Teacher couple Santhosh Kumar and Maneesha, who are at Sudhakar's shop, think the green crackers are a great idea. ""Everyone is looking to cut down on polluting fumes and for crackers which are easy to handle and don't cause burns,"" says Maneesha.How can you identify the eco-friendly crackers? Green cracker packets will have a 'Green Fireworks' logo and a QR code. ""The crackers are made without barium nitrate, thus making it less harmful and smokeless. The crackers are also of the 'V' series, which means it will not cause burns. Now almost all crackers come with an ISO label and are neatly packaged with details of the chemicals and components used, and even have the illustrative image of how to use them,"" says Rajesh Elankath, who runs a firecracker shop at Power House Junction. Sharan Das, a CAT aspirant who supports his father at the seasonal shop of Diwali crackers, describes the varieties that come under green crackers. ""Many are less sound-emitting crackers and easy to use by people of all age groups. Gold Rush, butterflies, i-spin, poppets and hot-wheels are some eco-friendly varieties we sell. They are fancy green types too,"" he notes.The cost proves a deterrent though, says Mukesh, a salesman in the shop. ""Though we tell customers about the new variety, people don't really go for it, as the green crackers are more expensive. While the conventional pencil cracker is just `150, the green cracker costs `350,"" he points out.But the bigger issue most people say, is that they are not aware of the eco-friendly varieties. ""It would be great if the authorities and the media spread awareness about this. I am an asthma patient and if these crackers are pollution-free, it will be a great relief for people like me to celebrate the festivals with firecrackers without worry. Hopefully, at least by next Diwali, the public be aware of green crackers,"" says Renju R Pappachan, who works at a saloon in Plamoodu.Welcoming the green cracker varieties is government employee, Sumithra H, who bought sparkles and ground chakras for her 12-year-old daughter.

"One-day affair or not, crackers can bring immense harm: Docs","Madurai: Bursting firecrackers has become an integral part of Diwali celebrations across the country. However, even if firecrackers are being burst only for a day, doctors say it is capable of doing irreparable damage to one's health.From perforated eardrums to severe burn injuries, doctors say the list is endless when it comes to accidental damage caused by fireworks. ""Most people think they know how to handle fireworks so it is safe but it is not true. /Fireworks are often unpredictable and any flying sparks or pieces can injure us. I have seen people who have gone blind or deaf, all because of one day's celebration,"" said Dr Amuthan Anbarasan, an ENT specialist.With studies showing how low the air quality can get during Diwali celebrations, it is no surprise that asthma patients, children and senior citizens are vulnerable to having respiratory problems. ""I strongly recommend children, senior citizens and those with a history of breathing difficulties to stay indoors and avoid exposure to smoke caused by fireworks. Even for healthy adults, air pollution can cause cough, allergies and wheezing,"" said Dr Amuthan. Doctors also say that green crackers are no better when it comes to the smoke and fumes affecting the lungs.Dr M Sri Vignesh, a plastic surgeon advises people to stay calm in case of burn injury and also learn to give first aid. ""Hand is the most exposed part while bursting crackers. In case of a simple first-degree burn, people should first gently wash the injured area in running water. Most burns caused by firecrackers are superficial and heal quickly,"" he said. In case of severe burns, it is advised to carefully remove the cause of the burn injury and take the victim to the hospital as soon as possible. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Pollution boards must stop waste burning, strictly monitor chimney emissions: EPCA","New Delhi: Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) on Friday asked for directions to the pollution control boards of the NCR states to ensure that no waste is burnt in their regions and chimney emissions are strictly monitored.In a special report on the pollution hotspots in Delhi-NCR submitted to the Supreme Court, EPCA said that it found massive quantities of plastic, industrial and other waste dumped and burnt in vacant areas across the pollution hotspots in the national capital region. ""The court may direct the pollution control boards of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to ensure that no waste is burnt in their regions, and that they find methods to remove the piled-up waste for processing or incineration,"" the EPCA report added.""On October 15, 2019, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) came into force in Delhi-NCR. This is being monitored by EPCA. /To further enhance the impact of GRAP this year, EPCA has decided to put extra focus on controlling air pollution in the hotspots in the region... This report is to inform the court of the situation on the ground, as found by chairman EPCA and the directions needed to ensure enforcement and action to control local sources of pollution, which are greatly adding to the challenge of toxic air in adverse weather conditions of winter,"" the report stated.EPCA on Friday also pointed out that Delhi has been able to bend the pollution curve with improvement in annual air pollution load on the city from 2010 to now. ""Even after these gains, the city still needs to reduce pollution levels by 65% to meet the national air quality standard. Therefore, it becomes highly critical to act on these pollution hotspots to control local polluting sources to ensure healthier air in the region.""The pollution watchdog, in the report, also said that it found many industries in pollution hotspots emanating black smoke.""There are standards for particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides. The industry is required to be compliant with the standard and ensure that there is no pollution,"" the report added.The three pollution control boards may be directed to rigorously monitor the emissions, especially at night, and take stringent action against no-compliant industries, it suggested.In the report, the EPCA pointed out that the pollution control boards have been penalising developers for mismanagement of dust at construction sites. However, these penalties are not leading to remedial actions as developers continue to operate ignoring the pollution being caused. To check such incidents, it said, the pollution control boards can be asked to file status report on the penalties imposed with names of the offenders. Status reports may also be sought on the non-compliant under-construction roads, the EPCA said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Day before Diwali, Chandigarh's air quality turns 'poor'","CHANDIGARH: A day before Diwali, city's air quality has turned from ""moderate"", which can be breathing discomfort to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases, to ""poor"" category, breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure.On Saturday, city recorded Air Quality Index (AQI) at 237, which is highest of recent times. Just within a month, the city's AQI has increased from 58 on October 1, to 237 on Friday.In the 27 days only, the city's air has turned from ""Moderate"" to 'poor'.The experts believe that due to dip in temperature, bursting of crackers and rise of stubble burning cases in neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana, are the main culprits behind 'poor' air quality in Chandigarh.The Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) have installed Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAAQMS) at Panjab University, Sector 25, which gives real time monitoring data after every hour.Last year on Diwali, which was on November 7, the air quality index (AQI) in Sector 22 was recorded at 311. In Sector 12, it was 297 and in Sector 17 commercial area, air quality index was recorded at 177.At present, the UT does not have any data to quantify proportion of various elements to the overall level of pollution. It had decided to conduct a source appointment study to help it prepare data to quantify proportion of various elements to the overall level of air pollution. /But the administration rejected the proposal because of its high cost last year. In 2017, the environment department representatives held a meeting with officials of Union environment ministry in which it was discussed that IIT, Kanpur, had procured Switzerland-made monitoring devices worth Rs 5 crore each to conduct the study in four different cities. As the cost was very high, the proposal was then turned down. Now, UT administration would float a tender to carry out the study. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Tolly stars urge 'say no to firecrackers, celebrate a noise-free Diwali'","Diwali means festivities, lights and merrymaking, but every year many animals throughout the country suffer horribly from our noisy celebrations.

We spoke to the Bengali celebs about the trauma that Diwali causes animals and they urge their fans to stop burning crackers for the sake of animals. They request, starting this Diwali let us say no to firecrackers, whether it be a religious, cultural or any celebratory event. Parno Mittra Parno, known to be an avid animal lover, votes for a noise free Diwali. ""Crackers are not fun for everyone. This diwali be a little considerate towards your furry friends.

Air pollution linked to thickness of arteries,"Hyderabad: A city-based study has directly linked ambient air pollution to increase in a type of cardiovascular disorder. The study carried out by an international team of researchers under the banner of Cardiovascular Health Effects of Air Pollution in Telangana, India (or the CHAI Project) used data from 3,278 participants largely from 28 peri-urban villages in Rangareddy district.Researchers studied the impact of particulate matter - such as that found in smoke and haze and having a diameter of less than 2.5 microns - on the health of individuals. They specifically looked at the carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) or the thickness of key arteries, a marker of cardiovascular risk. /The study found that when mean PM2.5 was 32.7 g/m3 (a range of 24.4 to 38.2 g/m3 was observed), an increase of even 1 g/m3 of PM2.5 in this range resulted in an average 1.79% increase in CIMT in all participants. In men, it was 2.98% and in women, there was an increase of 0.51%. The association between PM2.5 and CIMT was larger for those aged above 40 years at an average of 2.47% and for participants with high cardiometabolic risk such as obesity and metabolic syndrome.Interestingly, PM2.5 of 32.7 g/m3 falls within the 0-60 g/m3 category which is generally considered a safe level as per Indian standards. At traffic and industrially active areas, levels are often much higher.Making a comparison between air pollution and smoking, Otavio Ranzani, one of the authors of the study, went a step further saying, ""In general, in this population, the harmful effects of ambient air pollution corresponds to one third the harmful effects of tobacco smoking."" He said the difference would be the premise that everyone in the region respires 'polluted' air, while tobacco smoking is for a proportion only, and ""therefore air pollution is affecting everyone"".The study also made a secondary observation regarding household pollution and it was found that 60% of the participants used biomass fuel which too is linked with higher CIMT. Use of biomass cooking fuel was associated with CIMT increase of an average of 1.60% in all participants, and especially in women with an unvented stove where it was 6.14%.The study analysed data from Andhra Pradesh Children and Parent Study cohort (2010-2012) and ambient concentrations of PM2.5 between 2015 and 2016.The team of researchers belong to Pompeu Fabra University in Spain, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), National Institute of Nutrition, Indian Institute of Public Health, Sri Ramachandra University (SRU) Chennai and University of Washington, Seattle.The study titled 'Association between ambient and household air pollution with carotid intima-media thickness in peri-urban South India: CHAI-Project' was published in October in the International Journal of Epidemiology.

The celebrations go on for four days with lights, sweets, rangoli, new clothes, diwali parties and the list is never ending. In fact, the festivities start almost a month in advance and Maharashtrians make these special delicacies called 'faraal'. I remember my Mom and Nani making them and as kids we used to steal them from the containers to have the first bite. It is also the season when everyone goes shopping.

However, there is something that breaks my heart every Diwali and that is the sound of crackers. It not only damages the society, but also creates huge problem for the animals mostly the ones on the street. Every year I urge my fans and people around me to avoid the use of noisy crackers, but unfortunately, it has not changed much. Nevertheless, I would still request, once again, that all my loved ones should stay away from crackers and make this auspicious occasion a blessing for all of us including the animals.Vrushika Mehta: Diwali is all about family members, friends and loved ones coming together and celebrating the festival. I love Diwali vibes, be it eating different sweets, witnessing light all over or the most exciting part - making rangoli.

If I am not shooting this Diwali, I will definitely celebrate the festival with my family and hope this year, too, I get time to make it.Avinash Mishra: I love the fact that during Diwali all family members get together and I end up eating lots and lots of sweets. Moreover, me and my friends play games together after the Laxmi pooja.

This year I will be celebrating Diwali with my Yeh Teri Galiyaan cast.Piyush Sahdev: I love Diwali because I get to meet my family and siblings who are generally busy in their day to day lives.

One of the most memorable Diwali for me is when I was just 14 years old and my brother and my father were out of town, because of which I did the pooja, aarti and the chant which they used to perform every year. Since then I never stopped doing the aarti and I truly enjoy it.

This year, I am looking forward to spending quality time with my family. I fondly remember during my childhood days how I always waited for Diwali to be around friends, burst firecrackers and eat some mouth-watering scrumptious food. Putting aside the real religious significance of the festival, I think Diwali brings togetherness; it's about bonding with friends and celebrating the simple joys of life and primarily taking darkness away from each other's and our own lives. I'm glad that the Government has taken some action to cut down pollution and it's a brilliant step.

The festival is very special to me as my entire family comes together on this occasion. I remember as a child I used to help my mother in the kitchen when she used to make Diwali snacks.

Many experts felt, the overarching importance to noise pollution took away the attention from air pollution that is hazardous for human health. ""Noiseless fireworks cause more air pollution, particularly heavy metal pollution. In fact, high-decibel crackers cause less air pollution. But the choice is between the devil and the deep sea. Since containing noise pollution is court-mandated, our emphasis is on noise control. There is no such order to contain smoke-free fireworks,"" said a WBPCB officer.Chemical biologist Abhijit Ghosh explained that fireworks cause extensive air pollution in a short span of time leaving metal particles, dangerous toxins, harmful chemicals and smoke in the lower strata of air for days. ""Some of the toxins never fully decompose or disintegrate, but hang around in the environment, poisoning all they come into contact with,"" he said. The Met office, too, confirmed that the smog that hung over the city on Sunday night was mostly the result of bursting of firecrackers and weather conditions had little to do with it. ""If wind flows in from the north-west at this time of the year, smoke and pollutants often sail into the city from north India. But till Sunday night, the city had easterly wind that doesn't carry pollutants significantly,"" said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das. He added that northwesterly winds started flowing into Kolkata from Monday.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Kolkata air 17 times more toxic than normal on festive night,"KOLKATA: The city on Sunday celebrated a slightly muted Kali Puja and Diwali due to a crackdown on high-decibel crackers, but fireworks-triggered air pollution shot up to an alarming level across the metropolis as the night progressed and a sickening smog descended on Kolkata like a heavy shroud.By midnight, the PM 2.5 count - the finer particulate matter that drives air quality in Kolkata - hovered around 1,000 microgram per cubic meter (g/m3 ), which was 16-17 times higher than the safe limit of 60 g/m3 .

At ""moderate"", Agra's AQI was in fact better than last year.According to data from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), post-Diwali on Monday, out of 11 cities in Uttar Pradesh, air quality in Agra recorded the lowest concentration of PM2.5 at 179.An AQI between 0-50 is considered ""good"", 51-100 as ""satisfactory"", 101-200 ""moderate"", 201-300 ""poor"", 301-400 ""very poor"" and 401-500 as ""severe"". Above 500 is ""severe plus emergency"" category.Among two types of particulate matter (PM) that are recorded for pollution, PM2.5 (with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) is considered more dangerous than PM10 (with diameter less than 10 micrometres).In the lead-up to Diwali, too, Agra's PM2.5 concentration and AQI level remained relatively low, with PM2.5 hovering between 78 and 152, while AQI was in the ""satisfactory"" to ""moderate"" category. In comparison, during the same period last year, Agra's air quality was recorded in the ""poor"" to ""very poor"" category, while PM2.5 was 250 on October 26, 292 on October 27, 315 on October 28 and 325 on October 29.In comparison, cities like Baghpat, Bulandshahar, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Hapur, Noida and Greater Noida all recorded AQI in the ""very poor"" category, with PM2.5 between 300 and 397. It was 287 in Varanasi and 426 in Muzzafarnagar after Diwali.Prof Prashant Prakash, head of pulmonary medicine at SN Medical College, admitted that this year, the number of patients reporting respiratory illness after Diwali has come down by almost 20%. He added, ""Macro causes for this fall could include the fall in sales of firecrackers and automobiles.""Assistant scientific officer, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) Vishwanath Sharma, said, ""Compared to 2018, air pollution is significantly lower in Agra. /After Diwali, the air quality index remained in the ""moderate"" level. Noise pollution was also lower. We can say that due to increased awareness, fewer firecrackers were burst this year.""Dr Debashish Bhattacharya, a city-based environmentalist, said the reason why people in Agra burst fewer firecrackers this year could either be due to economic slowdown or greater awareness due to social media campaigns. ""Whatever the reasons, results are positive. Quality of air is not as bad as in other UP cities this year,"" he said, adding that he was hopeful this attitude will continue over the coming years.City-based doctor and environmentalist, Dr Sharad Gupta said, ""There is abundance of PM2.5 and PM10 in the air. Prolonged exposure to either, when they are beyond safe limits, can harm the respiratory system, as the ultra-fine particles can find their way into lungs and also enter the bloodstream. Since Diwali night, asthma and heart patients are facing trouble. Nevertheless, this year, pollution caused by bursting of crackers has significantly reduced in Agra.""

Delhi choking because of stubble burning: CM,"New Delhi: With the national capital engulfed in toxic fumes purportedly due of stubble burning in the neighbouring states, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday asked the Centre and the governments of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh to provide machinery and equipment to their farmers to stop the activity.Addressing a press conference, Kejriwal said that Delhi's air quality, which was good or moderate from March this year until mid-October, had deteriorated to dangerous levels because of residual crop burning in the last couple of weeks.""Everyone can see how polluted the air is since yesterday. Delhi is choking because of the stubble burning in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. I want to request the BJP to pressure its governments in both the states to provide facilities and equipment to farmers to stop them from burning stubble,"" the chief minister said. /He also appealed to the Congress-led government in Punjab to take action.Kejriwal said Delhi government was committed to implementing the Graded Response Action Plan. He said, ""We are trying whatever we can to reduce pollution."" Data available with the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) showed while Delhi was gradually recovering from firecracker smoke, the influence of stubble burning was only increasing.""Many farmers from Punjab and Haryana were willing to stop burning stubble if they got alternative machinery. But there is a lack of effort by the governments. The incidents of stubble burning have doubled from the previous year, which is a matter of concern,"" Kejriwal said. ""On behalf of the people of Delhi, I want to appeal to the Central and state governments to support us in reducing pollution,"" he added.Kejriwal said that the government's maiden four-day laser show at Connaught Place received good response from people. ""If there was no laser show, at least 30-40% more crackers would have been burst,"" he said, adding that the event will be organised on a much larger scale next year. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, meanwhile, lashed out at Kejriwal over his ""brazen lies"" on the issue of air pollution, reported PTI. The air pollution in Delhi was directly related to the rampant construction activity, widespread industrialisation and total mismanagement of the city traffic, Amarinder claimed.

Pollution levels shoot up in US Nagar on Diwali,"Rudrapur: As the time restrictions imposed by the Supreme Court on bursting of crackers went for a toss in Udham Singh Nagar district, the air pollution levels (when compared to last year) went up by 31% in Kashipur and by 25% in Rudrapur after Sunday's Diwali celebrations.The Air Quality Index (AQI) of several locations in Kashipur and Rudrapur rose to ""hazardous"" levels post Diwali. AQI is calculated on the basis of four major air pollutants, including ground-level ozone, particle pollution, Carbon Monoxide, and Sulphur Dioxide.Regional officer of state pollution control board (PCB) Anurag Negi told TOI that an acute rise in dust particles was recorded in both the cities on Diwali night. ""We recorded particulate matter 10 (PM10) level at an alarming 279 in Kashipur and at 255 in Rudrapur. /The same was 213 in Kashipur and 203 in Rudrapur last year.""Environmentalist Vijay Kumar told TOI that an AQI score recorded within 0-50 is considered to be good, between 50-100 is moderate, between 100-200 is unhealthy, above 200 is very unhealthy, and becomes hazardous once it crosses the 300 mark. ""As the AQI has crossed the 200 mark in Rudrapur and Kashipur, one can estimate as to how bad the air quality of these cities has become after Diwali,"" he said.Kumar added that high AQI score suggests that PM10 (particle matter) and PM2.5 levels are very high in the air. Such a condition can cause serious health concerns. ""PM2.5 are very fine particles that get deep into lungs and some may even get into the bloodstream. Exposure to these particles can affect a person's lungs and heart and cause many non-communicable diseases like cancer. Coarse particles (PM10-2.5) are of less concern, although they can irritate a person's eyes, nose, and throat,"" Kumar added.Though the police cracked down on some people violating the time restrictions but it made little impact on pollution levels. The police also failed to check noise pollution levels in the cities even though officials claim that the 10 pm deadline for cracker bursting was strictly maintained. According to data obtained from the regional office of PCB, noise levels in many areas were breached after residents started bursting ""ear-splitting"" crackers. The noise level hovered around 78.6 decibel (dB) on Diwali night in Kashipur as against the standard limit of 45 dB in residential areas. The sound pollution levels in sensitive areas of Kashipur and Rudrapur were recorded at 63.37 dB and 70.93 dB respectively as against the standard limit of 40 dB. Similarly, sound pollution levels were recorded at 81.55 dB and 84.25 dB at the commercial places in Kashipur and Rudrapur as against the standard limit of 55 dB.

"Lucknow: Traffic snarls, broken roads add to pollution","As the threat of respiratory ailments increases for citizens with each passing day, TOI looks at the top five reasons behind city's deteriorating air quality.Traffic snarls Going by the latest report of the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR), there are around 22 lakh vehicles (two-wheelers, three-wheelers and fourwheelers) in the city. Since traffic bottlenecks were common in the run-up to and on Diwali, vehicles stayed on roads for longer durations and emission of harmful gases such as nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide was evidently high.Damaged roads  A survey by Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) last year found that dust from broken roads contributed 87.1% to total air pollution in the city. It gave a list of 12 major stretches to the state public works department and Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC). Only two have been repaired. /In the meantime, more roads have been damaged this monsoon. A rough survey by TOI found broken roads in almost every city locality, barring VIP ones.Unbridled construction The Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) says the construction rate of government housing and commercial units has increased by 33.5% in the past two years. And, if the Confederation of Real Estate Authority of India (Lucknow chapter) is to be believed, construction of private apartments, housing colonies and complexes has increased by 300% in two years.However, a recent TOI survey found that in most of these places, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) rule to use green net against air pollution is blatantly violated. The district administration had directed LDA and UPPCB to act against offenders. Action is pending.Garbage burning  The LMC had decided to impose a fine of Rs 500 on those burning garbage in the open. The TOI found that people in many parts of the city, including Kaiserbagh, Jankipuram, Gomtinagar, Lalbagh and Nishatganj, continue to violate the trash management rule. The LMC has booked 14 of its sanitation workers over the past year, but no action has been taken against citizen offenders.Brick kilns/factories Smoke released by brick kilns and factories on the outskirts also contribute to polluting city air. The UPPCB recently directed 11 plywood factories - six in Talkatora and five on Faizabad road - to suspend operations till November 15. A fine of Rs 1.14 crore was also slapped on them for violating pollution norms. However, brick kilns in Chinhat, Matiyari and Sitapur road continue to operate without restrictions.

Eight UP cities among 10 most polluted in India,"LUCKNOW: As air pollution level increased further across UP, Wednesday became the most polluted day for various cities in the post-monsoon season so far. Ghaziabad occupied the top slot in India and seven other UP cities figured among top 10 places with their Air Quality Index (AQI) above 400 (severe category). According to the data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), AQI in Ghaziabad was 478, the highest in the country. Baghpat with AQI 461 was at fourth place, Noida (450) at fifth place, Greater Noida (438) at sixth and Hapur (435) seventh./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/Meerut (430) and Bulandshahr (430) shared the eighth spot while Muzaffarnagar (428) was at ninth rank. Delhi was at the 10th place with AQI of 419. Two cities from Haryana-Panipat (475) and Ballabhgarh (467)- were at second and third place respectively. The pollution level in Haryana, UP and Delhi have been increasing since the second week of October, but they shot up significantly after Diwali. UP and Haryana cities have been among top 10 since. On Tuesday, four UP cities occupied top four slots in the country when for the first time, AQI levels crossed 400 (severe category) mark. A long exposure to this can cause serious health complications in people, particularly those suffering from heart and lung diseases.Experts said that besides stubble burning, bursting of firecrackers and increase in vehicular movement due to festive rush, besides conducive weather conditions were the reasons behind the spike. ""Air quality will only deteriorate in the coming days, as temperatures will drop further and moisture content in the atmosphere will increase. Absence of green corridors and unbridled construction activities are prominent reasons for deteriorating air quality. Authorities need to strictly implement measures recommended by the National Green Tribunal to check air pollution,"" said environmentalist Venkatesh Dutta. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Suggest out-of-the-box ideas to combat pollution: Naidu to scientists,"NAGPUR: Expressing concern over the rising air pollution in many parts of the country, Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu urged scientists to come up with ""out-of-the-box"" solutions to combat the crisis.Naidu was speaking at the inaugural function of the two-day 15th international symposium on metal ions and organic pollutants in biology, medicine and environment organized by the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) here on Wednesday. Naidu also launched Neeri's public outreach programme 'Jagruti-Ek Samaj, Ek Lakshya' which aims at creating a knowledge base of all rivers and lakes with public participation. Stressing that environmental pollution and deterioration of ambient air quality are one of the foremost challenges currently facing the country, Naidu said that environment degradation will have a direct impact on the development of the nation. Referring to the World Economic Forum findings, Naidu stated that the cost of environmental degradation in India was estimated to be Rs 3.75 trillion a year. /He also cited the latest Centre for Science and Environment's  State of India's Environment (SoE) report which highlighted that air pollution was responsible for 12.5% of deaths in India. ""The air quality index measurements in most of the major cities constantly register air qualities that are 'poor' or 'severe'. Air Quality in Delhi on Wednesday fell in the category of 'hazardous' with particulate matter (PM) 10 and 2.5 soaring high. The numbers are indeed alarming and are a cause for great concern,"" said Naidu.On the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), he added, ""The programme will be a midterm, five-year action plan with 2019 as the first implementing year. The main aim of the programme would be 20-30% reduction of PM2.5 and PM10 concentration by 2024. Also, the metal ions and organic pollutants present in the air we breathe are extremely deleterious to health.""Suggesting another measure to reduce emissions, the vice president stressed the need to promote renewable sources of energy. He also advised regular cleaning, preservation, and maintenance of water bodies, which are ""turning toxic"" with increased urbanization. ""The CSE Report also estimates that 86 water bodies in the country are critically polluted, with both surface and groundwater being under severe stress. Groundwater is also facing over exploitation, there has been an unsustainable increase in the number of deep tube wells that has gone up by 80% between 2006-07 and 2013-14,"" said Naidu. Adding that around 70% of surface water in India is unfit for consumption, Naidu said, ""The quantity and type of metal ions present in water determine the possible health and environmental hazards. Detection and removal of contamination from water in a cost-effective manner must be our priority.""Terming cancer as a ""burden on India"" which has more than doubled over the last 26 years, the Vice-President stated that a number of studies have linked cancer to several environmental factors including pollution and radiation. ""The second-most common cause of death in India after cardiovascular disease must receive attention from both doctors and policymakers.The key to curing cancer is early detection, in which imaging plays a crucial part. We must also constantly innovate and create new, less invasive treatment protocols for cancer that are affordable and accessible,"" he said, urging scientists to translate research and development in local languages to benefit the people. In his address, Neeri director Rakesh Kumar said that though the environmental standards so far formulated are linked with health, medical professionals and environmental scientists do not come together to discuss environment and health issues.

"As Delhi stays in grip of smog, air quality worsens to 'severe'","NEW DELHI: Delhi-NCR continued to choke in a shroud of toxic smog for the second day as air quality deteriorated further due to accumulation of pollutants in calm wind conditions, higher ingress of smoke from stubble burning and a low cloud cover on Wednesday.The average AQI of the city at 4pm entered the ""severe"" zone for the first time this season, deteriorating from 400 (very poor) to 419 on Wednesday. Air quality in all neighbouring cities, apart from Gurgaon, was similarly ""severe"" with Ghaziabad recording the highest pollution levels in the country (AQI 478) for the second day running./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/Even as toxins from Diwali firecrackers were yet to fully clear, the contribution from stubble burning in Delhi's pollution touched a new season's high of 35% on Wednesday, according to data from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR). This means more than a third of the city's air pollution came from outside sources. SAFAR said this share is likely to drop to 27% on Thursday.The deteriorating air quality led to the CPCB task force announcing that coal-based industries will now remain shut till November 2, beyond the original deadline of October 31. These include industries that have not switched to PNG. The task force also extended the ban on night construction by four hours. ""Construction activities like earthwork, which have potential to generate dust, hot-mix plants and stone crushers will not operate from 6pm to 10am till November 2 in Delhi-NCR,"" CPCB said on Wednesday.Met officials say wind speeds may pick up slightly by Thursday, but no significant improvement is expected. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at the IMD, said cloud cover should also reduce on Thursday, which could lead to improved visibility.Wind speed to pick up but don't expect much reliefNo Significant Drop In Temperatures Likely In Next 2 DaysSrivastava said while wind speeds may pick up slightly by Thursday, the change will not be too significant. ""A combination of factors like reduction in cloud cover and improved wind speed may bring down pollution slightly, but real improvement is only expected around November 2-3, when wind speeds pick up,"" he said.The IMD says northwesterly winds will continue to influence Delhi-NCR this week with pollutants from stubble burning arriving from Punjab and Haryana. Delhi's AQI has steadily worsened since Diwali day, when it was recorded at 337 (very poor). The reading was 368 the day after Diwali and CPCB's official daily bulletin reading for Tuesday was recorded at 400 (very poor). Air quality had, however, touched ""severe"" levels on both Monday and Tuesday night, as temperatures dropped. Generally, the 24-hour average AQI readings released by CPCB at 4pm are taken as the day's representative AQI.Data according to the CPCB central control room, Delhi NCR's average PM2.5 levels were 272 micrograms per cubic metre at 8pm on Wednesday. At the same time, the PM10 levels were recorded at 449 micrograms per cubic metre. The safe standard for these pollutants is 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively.Delhi's maximum temperature was recorded at 30.8 degrees Celsius, while the minimum was recorded at 20.2 degrees Celsius - four notches above normal, as the cloud cover trapped heat and prevented a sharp fall in night temperature. Met officials said no significant drop in temperatures is expected in the next few days.Most cities in west UP see 'severe' levelsMost cities in western Uttar Pradesh witnessed 'severe' levels of Air Quality Index (AQI) on Wednesday as dense smog continued to envelop the region on the third day post Diwali. While Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Baghpat, Bulandshahr and Noida witnessed AQI levels of over 400, Moradabad was an exception with 'moderate' 169 AQI levels (stark improvement from severe category two days ago) and Agra registered 'poor' air quality levels of 249.Weather experts said the problem aggravated due to unfavourable wind speed that lead to accumulation of pollutants. A relief is likely on the weekend, they said.Meanwhile, Bareilly air worsened with an AQI of 470 on Wednesday against Tuesday's 450. The data provided by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) was for Wednesday till 4pm and was an average of the previous 24 hours. The Meerut zone, comprising nine districts, has been witnessing severe air quality propelling local administrations to take drastic measures.Like Muzaffarnagar had resorted to spraying water on trees and roads on Tuesday, Meerut followed suit on Wednesday to deal with unabated smoggy conditions.

ENCOURAGE PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES WITHIN HOMEAnupam Sibal, Group Medical Director, Apollo Hospitals Group, accepts that the situation has been better this year but adds that the days after Diwali actually represent the damage that has happened. ""When you look out of the window today, you can really see the damage that has happened to the environment. Things that we can do as parents is that we should not encourage any outdoor activities when the AQI is so high. The best time for a child to go out would be in the afternoon if they have to go to the park. We need to encourage activities within the house. Outdoor activities in schools have also been curtailed, though this is something that kids should not have to deal with, but in this situation, it is best advised to avoid being outside. If you have a history of respiratory problems or you feel uncomfortable going out, stepping outside is not recommended. While the AQI going beyond 300 is an important factor, the number is not everything. You have to see how you are feeling, irrespective of AQI levels,"" he says.AVOID USING AGARBATTIS, MOSQUITO SPRAYS AND CAMPHORVivek Nangia, Director and Head of Pulmonology at Fortis Flt Lt Rajan Dhall Hospital, adds, ""We need to decide on our outdoor activities depending on the AQI level. When the AQI is more than 400, then people should avoid going out. We should be restricting outdoor movement to the bare minimum and keep our indoor environment as clean as possible. Avoid using agarbattis, mosquito repellent sprays or using camphor inside your home. These are simple measures that one should be taking. Take a walk only when it is bright and sunny outside.""Hazratganj shrouded in smog on Friday (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)WEAR PROTECTIVE CLOTHINGRashmi Sharma, Consultant Dermatologist at Fortis Hospital, Delhi, says that people are advised to wear protective clothing in this weather.

I recommend that people should avoid going out, and if you do, wash your face with a soap-free cleanser once you come back. You should frequently re-apply moisturiser and sunscreen should be used four-five times a day. In your diet, you should increase citrus fruits, and consume apples and cranberries. When going out, cover your face, wear bandanas, glasses, hand gloves and focus on protective clothing,"" she advises. Meanwhile.

If the Air Quality Index (AQI) goes higher than 300, it is considered hazardous. If there is about particulate matter (PM) 22 micro grams/cubic metre in air, that'll be equal to smoking one cigarette. In such cases, all I can suggest is for people to keep indoors or if at all they can't avoid it, they should use good quality masks. Hydration is another helpful thing in such cases.""

As immediate precautions, one should maintain cleanliness in and around their houses, clean hands on a regular basis, wear masks before walking out in the open, avoid exposure to people already suffering from acute infections, keeping yourself well hydrated and avoid early morning and late evening walks."" Adding further Arora says, ""Taking vitamin C and Omega 3 fatty acids on a regular basis can help fight respiratory infections and allergies. We do not recommend masks for kids below the age of three because they can choke. Schools should ensure that they have air purifiers inside classrooms. Schools and parents should cut down on sports and games for kids because when you do any physical activity, your heartbeat goes up and you inhale more pollutants. Another age group that gets really affected by the poor air quality is the elderly. Using a mask is very important whenever going out and use air purifiers in cars as well."" - With inputs from Yashi Agarwal For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution: How homeopathy can help in easing asthma symptoms,"Air pollution is now one of the leading causes of death in the world. The World Health Organisation (W.H.O.) estimates about 4.2 million premature deaths are caused due to ambient air pollution worldwide. In addition to the obvious illnesses involving the respiratory system like bronchial asthma, air pollution is also understood to cause a substantially increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and strokes. A host of skin conditions are also known to get aggravated due to air pollution.India, too, is grappling with air pollution, as an aggressive pace of development in the past few decades, has contributed to rising air pollution levels across the country. /Sadly, the national capital region (N.C.R.) of Delhi has held the thorny crown of having the most polluted air in the world for a while now. With winter setting in, and this coinciding with crop burning activities as well as Diwali firecrackers, air pollution levels are peaking. Land locked regions like the N.C.R. are unlucky to have this trifecta bearing down on it every year, making Air Quality Index (A.Q.I.) levels shoot up sharply. As a result, this period of the year sees a sharp increase in episodes of bronchial asthma, hyper-reactive airway disease, allergic rhinitis and several other issues. Every clinic is inundated with cases of these illnesses during this time of the year. Prescriptions of bronchodilators, anti-allergic medicines, nasal drops and similar medicines are rampant. The use of these medicines, although, adept at providing quick relief in the initial phases, may result in increased dependence leading to a gradual increase in dosage and frequency of usage because patients may become immune to lower doses.Homeopathy is 'famously' associated with the treatment of asthma and many conditions related to hypersensitivity and allergies. A very high number of patients frustrated with the increasing frequency of their episodes and increasing dosage of their medicines seek homeopathic treatment for better long-term management without the danger of side effects. For all these conditions, homeopathy offers a two-pronged approach. One: to provide immediate relief to the patient. Two: to provide long term treatment to gradually bring down the frequency and intensity of aggravated episodes of these conditions. It is this second point which sets homeopathy apart from the approach of conventional medicine. Homeopathy used over prolonged periods can bring down the frequency and intensity of aggravated episodes of conditions related to air pollution. Long term use of homeopathic medicines often results in a decrease or stoppage of the use of conventional medicines. This trend of reversal in severity and frequency of episodes is generally not expected in conventional medicine. For long term improvement, we prescribe Calcarea Carbonica to patients. In acute phases of breathing trouble, medicines like Hepar Sulphur and Ipecac can quickly relieve asthmatic episodes and continuous coughing and result in an immediate reduction of the use of bronchodilators and other similar medicines. The improved ventilation of lungs and an increase in respiratory volumes after using homeopathic medicines is frequently demonstrated through objective testing methods like the pulmonary function test. A blocked nose can be a very distressing symptom in patients. Small children are unable to fall asleep for several nights due to this. In these cases, we find that Lycopodium Clovatum, given orally, provides relief in short order to the patient - children and adults alike, even when several doses of nasal drops have failed. Acute bouts of sneezing in patients of rhinitis may increase with exposure to high levels of air pollution. A very effective medicine in this case is Allium Cepa, which is given at a high frequency to stop sneezing and provide some relief to the associated nasal and eye symptoms. In addition to medicines, patients should also try and limit further irritation of the respiratory and nasal passages. Avoiding the use of odorous substances like room fresheners, perfumes, incense etc is important. The additives, colouring agents, preservatives and other chemicals in processed and junk food may also contribute to worsening allergies. These are best avoided too. Parents must understand that the health of their children is paramount. Acute episodes of asthma and hyper-reactive airway disease are best managed at home. This may mean missing school (and possibly, work for the parents) for several days at a stretch. However, getting proper rest and medication in the initial phase ultimately results in fewer days of school getting missed. Most importantly, lead a disciplined lifestyle: go to bed early, engage in moderate but regular exercise. Exercise helps keep the immune system toned, making it less susceptible to over-reaction and aiding quick recovery.

Doctors suggest lifestyle changes to cope with air pollution in Kolkata,"On a day when the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority declared a public health emergency in the Delhi-NCR region and banned construction activity till November 5 since pollution levels in the region entered the ""severe plus"" category, Kolkata too reeled under toxic ambient air as a consequence of rampant bursting of fireworks during Kali Puja immersions. Though the city's air pollution level stayed comparatively less on the day of Kali Puja and Diwali, it has gone up dramatically in the following days. From October 29 to October 31, air pollution here has been at its the worst, shooting beyond 300g/m3, which falls in the 'very poor' category, on Wednesday night. Across Kolkata, the AQI has been in the range between 200 (poor) and 400 (very poor), with Jadavpur (391), Rabindrasarovar (368) and Rabindrabharati University (361) recording some of the highest AQI levels on Wednesday early morning. /While people are trying to do their bit by using air purifiers at home and wearing masks while stepping out, doctors share a few suggestions to help people go about their daily lives in the toxic air.'Raise awareness and green cover to check pollution'Amitabh Ray, radiation oncologist at Ruby General Hospital, says that in 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) confirmed that outdoor air pollution is a cause of cancer. ""Tiny dust-like particles just millionths of a metre wide, called 'particulate matter', make up a part of outdoor air pollution. The smallest particles, known as PM10 and PM2.5, are linked to cancers caused by pollution. The greatest weapon against pollution related cancer is increasing awareness regarding the same and making authorities wake up to the reality of air pollution increasing the risk of cancer. Self-protection with the use of air masks, which trap the harmful suspended particulate matter, is our first line of defence. Apart from this, increasing the green cover of every city may also reduce the impact of pollutants,"" he shares. 'Avoid burning candles, camphor and incense sticks'Raja Dhar, director of department of pulmonology at Fortis Hospital, says proper protection is a must while going when pollution level is high. ""But indoor air pollution is way more harmful than outdoor pollution. Surprisingly, we don't talk about it as much. Outdoor air pollution also adds to indoor pollution. Added to that, what we burn inside the house - mosquito repellents, candles, camphor and incense sticks (agarbattis) - also contributes to indoor pollution. I always suggest using indoor plants and modern air purifiers to curb pollution.""'Wear sunglasses and keep your face covered' Aparajita Ghosh, a dermatologist at Ruby General Hospital, says increase in air pollution leads to problems like complexion mediated change, contact allergy, eyelid allergy, dryness, premature ageing, allergic-contact dermatitis and contact dermatitis, among others. ""Skin is a living organ and hence, prone to being affected by pollution most easily. To protect yourself, wear sunglasses and keep your face covered with a scarf. Wash your face with plain water, use a mild soap, try to avoid oil if there is any allergy, apply a moisturiser and consult a doctor instead of buying things from medical shop on your own,"" she says. 'Keep the house clean; use recommended masks only' Aparna Mitra, consulting paediatrician at Shishu Mangal Hospital, feels that outdoor activities among children have gone down many folds and even sporting activities have become extremely institutionalized. ""Considering this situation, I would never ask a child to not go out, but I would certainly ask the parents to take them out at a time when the pollution level is at its lowest,"" she says.Talking about the use of air purifiers, she says that while it is important to use modern purifiers to keep the indoor air pollution free, keeping the house clean is also important. ""The pillows, carpets and cushions - which absorb maximum pollutants and dust - should be cleaned regularly,"" she says.Besides, another useful tool to fight pollution is face mask. However, Aparna feels using normal masks does not work. ""Before recommending masks, we gauge whether or not a child needs it and if s/he does, we ask them to go for the recommended masks only (N99, N95 etc). Otherwise, there is no point in using masks,"" she says, adding that during Kali Puja and Diwali, 80% of her patients complained of various lungs related disorders caused by air pollution. 'Avoid stepping out early morning' Hindol Dasgupta, chest physician, Woodlands Hospital, says smog can cause/aggravate health problems including asthma, lung cancer, skin diseases, chronic bronchitis and other respiratory problems. ""Besides, it can also lead to eye irritation and reduce resistance to cold and lung infections. Actually, COPD patients are the biggest victims of this. Though we don't have the option to not step out, one must avoid going out early morning, when pollution level is at its peak. Surgical masks are hardly of any help when pollution is high. Though N95 masks help, they have to be changed every eight hours for them to work effectively,"" he says.'Kolkata will surpass Delhi in air pollution' I use the footbridge to visit Salt Lake every morning for my daily quota of shopping. I also take my cycle along. Since Diwali, there has been a significant rise in air pollution. My nose and throat, especially, feel uncomfortable. There has been a considerable change in weather lately and if things don't improve, the day is not far when Kolkata will surpass Delhi in air pollution. - Arijit Chatterjee, Lake Town resident'It's impossible to work without a mask'I can't do without a pollution mask because of the high amount of dust and toxic gas released by passing vehicles. It is impossible to sweep the streets without taking due precautions. This mask helps to protect my nose and throat to a great extent, but it is still not enough.  - Liton Sutar, sweeper near Salt Lake stadium'Air quality is always bad around this time of the year'Our profession makes it mandatory for us to wear these masks. The quality of air is always bad around this time of the year. However, till now, I have not had any problem in my nose or throat. But it looks like the pollution levels are going to increase and we are bracing ourselves to face it.  - Sujit Biswas, traffic volunteer near VIP Bazar For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Delhiites queue up at hospitals with respiratory issues,"NEW DELHI: Panic gripped the city's residents on Friday with the air quality in the 'severe' category. People complained about persistent cough, chest congestion, breathing problems and irritation in the eyes - symptoms that have become synonymous with Delhi's weather over the last few days./<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/pollution-news"">Track the pollution level in your city</a>/""My four-year-old son has been coughing incessantly even though he hasn't stepped outside even once. My husband, who is a marketing executive with a pharmaceutical company, isn't well either,"" said Tejaswini Kumar, a resident of Malviya Nagar. She added that if Delhi's air quality remains so poor, people will be forced to flee the city. Kumar's son and husband are otherwise healthy and do not have a history of any respiratory or chronic illness. They are suffering nonetheless.The situation of those suffering from asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other chronic illnesses is worse. ""More than 50% of my patients are those suffering from exacerbation of pre-existing health issues due to bad weather. If air quality remains like this, I fear the hospitals will be flooded with patients complaining about breathing difficulties and other emergencies,"" said Dr GC Khilnani, chairman, PSRI Institute of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine.Dr Randeep Guleria, director of AIIMS, said shutting schools, wearing masks and implementing vehicle rationing schemes are all emergency measures. ""We need sustainable solutions to deal with the crisis of air pollution that has become an annual feature in NCR,"" he said.According to Dr Guleria, a professor of pulmonary medicine, bad air doesn't affect the lungs alone. ""Heart patients and those suffering from neurological disorders are equally affected,"" he said.High levels of pollutants in the atmosphere, studies show, can trigger stroke in those at high risk of neurological disorders. Patients suffering from heart failure and coronary artery disease are also at risk of worsening of symptoms due to poor air quality, research shows. Doctors advise those at risk for stroke or cardiovascular diseases to remain indoors and avoid morning walks until the air quality improves.Dr Minakshi Bhardwaj, medical superintendent at RML Hospital, said they have also been getting a number of patients with respiratory health issues. ""There are many healthy people who are anxious and in panic. They are worried about nagging cough, irritation in the eyes and other symptoms that have become synonymous with this weather,"" she said.The hospital is advising all patients, especially those in extremes of age and with pre-existing illnesses, to avoid outdoor activities until the air quality improves. ""If you must go out, it is advisable to wear a mask. N95 masks are good. However, it has to be worn as specified and not used beyond its shelf life,"" said another doctor.""The percentage of people who are complaining of respiratory ailments has majorly increased. Our routine patients on the other hand are cancelling their regular visits so as to avoid outdoor pollution,"" said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, respiratory medicine at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital.
