Test of firecrackers shows presence of toxic metals: Awaaz Foundation,"MUMBAI: After Awaaz foundation on Thursday found none of the 16 varieties of firecrackers flouting the noise levels, it has found almost 13 of the 22 varieties tested on Saturday containing the banned toxic heavy metals such as barium, lead and arsenic. In a letter, immediately sent to chief Secretary Manu Kumar Srivastava and police commissioner Vivek Phansalkar Awaaz Foundation convenor Sumaira Abdulali, said her foundation analyzed the chemical content of commonly available firecrackers, and found chemicals banned by the Supreme Court including Barium in several of them.""Our test report of October 2022 is attached. Last year, in 2021, the presence of barium was openly displayed on firecracker packaging. This year, none of the boxes even mentioned the presence of barium, although most crackers continue to contain barium,"" she pointed out urging for stringent action. /In 2021, the Supreme Court had expressed serious concern about the effect of hazardous chemicals on people's health. The SC had placed on record Awaaz findings in their Order dated October 29, 2021.The SC had reiterated the ban on barium and said, ""We direct all the states/Union Territories to see that the directions issued earlier by this court and issued by this court are strictly complied with. Any lapse on the part of the state governments/state agencies and Union Territories shall be viewed very seriously and if it is found that any banned firecrackers are manufactured, sold and used in any particular area, the chief secretary of the concerned state(s), the secretary (homes) of the concerned state(s) and the commissioner of police of the concerned area, district superintendent of police of the concerned area and the SHO/police officer in-charge of the concerned police station shall be held personally liable."" Abdulali said the foundation also found the presence of other highly toxic chemicals banned under the Hazardous Chemicals Rules like arsenic, sulphur, chlorine. ""In the interest of health of all citizens, please ensure that no firecrackers containing chemicals banned by the Supreme Court are distributed, sold or used in Maharashtra at any time,"" she stated at the end of her letter.These metallic elements, say experts, are considered systemic toxicants that are known to induce multiple organ damage, even at lower levels of exposure. They are also classified as human carcinogens (known or probable) according to the international environmental protection agencies and the International Agency for Research on Cancer. They also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and thus the climate change. A year ago the mandatory QR Codes which can track emission levels and are published alongside NEERI certification on the packs of Green Crackers had been found to be fake by the Foundation. Also, a number of other citizens attempting to verify them through an App developed by NEERI, the same Government agency which has developed chemical formula for 'green crackers', had found them fake.The new WHO guidelines of September 2021 say that such an air pollution could lead to reduced lung growth and function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma among children. In adults, ischemic heart disease and stroke"" and that ""evidence is also emerging of other effects such as diabetes and neurodegenerative conditions"".The WHO has also recommended lower air quality levels for six pollutants including sulphur dioxide and has said that air pollution is one of the biggest environmental threats to human health, alongside climate change. Sulphur and its oxides are a leading cause of acid rain. Firecrackers also emit greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide. State's Mumbai Climate Action Plan has already acknowledged that air pollution levels in Mumbai are high during winter and that there is an urgent need to control air pollution. We request that the state should ban all fake 'green crackers' from distribution, sale and use to safeguard health, environment and climate change,"" environment activists said.

"Need to plug healthcare gaps in post-Covid world, says Soumya Swaminathan","In an exclusive interview with The Times of India 's Steffy Thevar and Piyush Bhusari, World Health Organisation (WHO) chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan spoke about the need to plug the gaps created in healthcare with regard to routine immunization and surveillance during the two years of the pandemic. ExcerptsWhat are the challenges that WHO wants to focus on in a post-Covid-19 world?We are witnessing a rise in tuberculosis infections and deaths. /We will soon have a Global TB Report, which will also indicate a rise in the (TB) infections, especially the multi-drug resistant and paediatric cases. We are increasing screening and using new tools, such as digitaltracking, SMS and apps, which we used Covid-19, for keeping a tab on other infectious diseases. Similar focus is also needed on chronic diseases. We have 25% of Indians with high blood pressure at a young age. We need increased investment in diagnostics and testing for diabetes. We need to train nurses and paramedical staff to use algorithms. We are finding an increased link between air pollution and lifestyle diseases. Housing, sanitation and physical activity are primary factors for the lifestyle-induced ailments. We need to invest in systematic surveillance for NCDs (non-communicable diseases) and understand the burden of illnesses on publichealth infrastructure. We need to fill the gaps created in healthcare during the two years of pandemic.The post-pandemic time has shown us more attention towards mental health. How to tackle this?Mental health is also part of NCDs. Though we are talking about mental health more now, there is very little that WHO can do. The governments must take initiatives and invest more in the sphere. The focus should be on educating more. WHO can provide data and guidelines that can help the governments. We are likely to see a rise in dementia in developing countries, and we are not prepared for it.During Covid-19, we saw excess use of steroids and antibiotics. Are we looking at a possible fallout?Not only excess use of such drugs, we also witnessed their abuse and misuse. We need to have a training mechanism for doctors, maybe their re-registration after regular intervals so that they can update their information. Covid-19 has increased health literacy among people. They must question the prescriptions by their general physicians and stop consuming antibiotics or medicines over the counters.What do you think about the huge amount of vaccines that are being wasted?It is a pity that the vaccines are being wasted. But currently there is no response to the vaccines. Companies had to manufacture the vaccines at their own risk, as it was the demand of the time.Has Covid-19 helped improve health infrastructure?Yes. But we also need to focus on primary healthcare. Though doctors are important, we need to train and recruit nurses and paramedical staff at the primary healthcare centres.Why can't vaccine be developed for ailments like TB?We have the right technology and information for various vaccines. But the right kind of investments, like what we got during Covid-19, would be helpful. Developed countries are still not interested in investment in diseases prevalent in Asia and Africa.

"Jamshedpur: Doctors, animal lovers worried over firecrackers","JAMSHEDPUR: With no Covid restrictions in the state after a gap of two years, revellers are eagerly waiting to celebrate Diwali. Health experts and environmentalists, however, are concerned about the noise and air pollution levels on and after the festival.In Steel City, state pollution board regional director Jitendra Kumar Singh and his team will monitor the pollution level on Diwali night (October 24) at 12 places. Singh appealed to residents of the city to abide by the government guidelines to burst firecrackers with sound limits of less than 120 decibels and within the 8pm to 10pm window. /He also said people should also burst only green firecrackers as recommended by the Supreme Court. This year, the administration has given its nod to set up makeshift firecracker markets only in the open grounds across the district, keeping the safety aspects in mind.Meanwhile, health experts are not sure whether the revellers will stick to the two prescribed norms for firecrackers. Anita Banerjee, a former doctor at the state-run MGMMCH, said, ""Residents have already people have started bursting crackers and no authorities are taking note of it or initiating any action."" She said noise from sudden bursts of crackers can be very damaging for cardiac and neurological patients. Dr Banerjee also said many patients at this time of the year suffer from sudden heart attacks, triggered by sudden explosions of crackers and the chances of heart attacks multiply. She advised all cardiac patients to remain indoors with all doors and windows shut.Kakoli Mukherjee, a teacher, is worried for her mother, who suffers from many chronic diseases, including of the heart, and she said revellers often violate the law and burst crackers in front of her house. In the past, her repeated phone calls to the local police station have never been addressed.Similarly, homeowners with pets and other animal lovers expressed concern over the bursting of crackers during Diwali.P. Chandu, who lives in the Sonari area near a big-budget Kali Puja pandal, lamented, ""For the last two years, my dog had no problems but this time, I'm not sure how my Tuffy, who has become my family member, will react to crackers.""

"'Covid survivors need to stay cautious in Diwali, winter'","Nagpur: Monsoon withdrawal was once again late and very rapid. There was heavy rainfall till the last week, then sudden change of weather and now onset of winter is on cards. Diwali too is just round the corner. /This year it will be special because people will be celebrating the festival free of the Covid restrictions for the first time after two years. Doctors have advised people to pay attention to the weather change along with the ""pollution due to firecrackers"" and take additional care this Diwali. Senior pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat said, ""Diwali brings triggers for respiratory problems such as pollution due to firecrackers but this year weather change is also happening at the same time. Winter and air pollution have put patients at double risk for developing asthma, COPD and other lung disorders.""""When the season changes, our body needs time to adjust to the environment. Respiratory diseases also increase during this change. Viral fever, body ache, common cold cases also increase along with asthma. Weather change affects children and senior citizens more. At such times, preventive measures should be taken,"" he said. Patients of lung disorders need to take extra care or there can be a sharp increase in respiratory disorders in November. Those who have recovered from Covid-19 must be careful about lung infections, either due to weather change or pollution caused by firecrackers. ""Covid recovered persons must be aware of long Covid. Sudden onset of lung infection cannot be overruled during this period,"" said physician Dr Vivek Bhargav who has treated Covid patients. ""Many Covid recovered persons, especially senior citizens with diabetes and hypertension, are coming back with respiratory illnesses, fever and similar complaints. Some of them test positive for Covid too,"" said Dr Bhargav. Doctors also spoke about smog which is quite common during Diwali. ""This year, winter is just setting in and Diwali is here. When fog mixes with air pollutants, it turns into smog, which results in decreased lung function and causes respiratory inflammation,"" said pulmonologist Dr Parimal Deshpande. Certified yoga trainer Praful Hatgaonkar said regular exercises like walking and cycling won't help much during polluted days ahead. ""People with lung conditions must follow ways to strengthen the organs. These include indoor pranayama, some simple breathing exercises and drinking ample water regularly,"" he said. # Precations for lung patients Winter setting in and first restriction-less Diwali already here Asthma, COPD patients should prepare for double challengeThose having lung conditions, stay away from crackers It could be smog in Diwali, don't misunderstand it as fog High level of pollutants may damage immune system  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Wind speed low, spike in farm fires in Haryana: Air may turn 'severe' tonight, says SAFAR","GURUGRAM: The city's air quality index (AQI) continued to remain in the 'poor' category for the third consecutive day with a reading of 251. Officials said pollutants are suspended in the atmosphere because of low wind speed, leading to the deterioration of air quality.On Sunday, the AQI was 'poor' at Vikas Sadan (176) and Sector 51 (299) stations, while it was 'very poor' at Teri Gram (279). Data was unavailable at Gwalpahari station. Meanwhile, the state recorded 1,110 active fire locations (AFL) between September 17 and October 23, according to satellite data collected by Nasa and collated by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute. The maximum fires were reported in Kaithal (303) and Kurukshetra (224), followed by Karnal (114) and Jind (92). Haryana had seen 1,508 farm fires in the same period last year.According to SAFAR, fine particles (size less than 2.5 micrometres) contribute 48% to PM10. For the next three days, speed will oscillate between 5kmph to 10kmph, causing weak dispersion of pollutants. /The AQI is likely to be 'very poor' on Diwali and it is likely to worsen to the 'lower end of severe' on Diwali night and the next day, as per SAFAR.Experts said fire counts over the northwest region are gradually increasing and their impact on Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to increase to 5%. Further, the contribution of farm residue burning across NCR is expected to rise to 15-18% by the day after Diwali, they said.""Even a small increase in the additional local emissions due to firecrackers is likely to have a significant deterioration impact on AQI during October 24 and 25,"" said Shubhansh Tiwari, research associate, Amity Center for Air Pollution Control.Meanwhile, with 'poor' AQI of 259, Delhi saw the cleanest pre-Diwali day in seven years on Sunday. Since 2015, the day before Diwali would often hover in the 'severe' or 'very poor' range, which would worsen to the 'severe' category on Diwali day, except for 2019 when the AQI was 287. Weather analysts said low wind speed that couldn't carry stubble smoke and fewer farm fires due to the late withdrawal of monsoon were the major reasons the air quality was slightly better.
