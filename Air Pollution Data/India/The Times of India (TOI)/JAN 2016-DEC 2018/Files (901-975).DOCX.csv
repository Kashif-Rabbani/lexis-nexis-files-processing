'Aggravated by pollutants',"Ahmedabad: As World Diabetes Day is observed across the globe on November 14, to raise awareness about the growing menace of this lifestyle disease, experts said a new front has opened up which city dwellers have to fight while battling the condition.Dr Tiven Marwah, a city-based diabetologist and endocrinologist, said that the disease is striking younger people and is spreading ever wider. Besides factors such as stress, sedentary lifestyles and bad eating habits, one also has to factor in pollutants.""There has been no substantial study in Gujarat or India but experts in the West are establishing links between a specific sets of pollutants and the beta cells in the pancreas which release insulin. While pollution cannot cause diabetes, it can aggravate the condition. /We call these environmental factors endocrine disrupters,"" he said, adding that the impact in the Indian context, with cities like Delhi choking from air pollution, needs to be studied.He added that the spread of disease is now 10 times what it used to be two decades ago. Dr Banshi Saboo, a city-based diabetologist, said society has to address the issue of sedentary lifestyles. ""I would say that sitting is akin to smoking. You should not sit for more than 90 minutes at one go. This year's theme is centred around the family. We advise family members of people diagnosed with diabetes to go for screening. One also has to understand the burden carried by the young patients for the rest of their lives,"" he said.Dr Saboo was part of a pan-India study on diabetes by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which found that about 15% of the population below 40 years is susceptible to diabetes.Screening important part of the fightExperts consider screening to be an important aspect of the fight. Dr Sanjeev Phatak, a city-based diabetologist, said that more than half of all patients are diagnosed only when they go for a medical check-up. ""We say that the treatment of diabetes is like the power play in cricket - if you are careful in the early years, managing it becomes easier afterwards,"" he said.He added that now there is virtually no difference in prevalance of the condition based on parameters such as gender, income level or geographic area, whether urban or rural.

Noida has green funds but can't use them,"NOIDA: Authorities in Gautam Budh Nagar claim to have nearly Rs 7 crore - collected as ""green fund"" to combat air pollution - lying largely unused due to lack of directions from the National Green Tribunal (NGT), even as the NCR continues to battle a toxic haze. On Tuesday, the AQI was recorded at 426 in Noida and 411 in Greater Noida, both considered 'severe'.Officials said Noida Authority, GNIDA and YEIDA collected Rs 2.20 crore, Rs 2.60 crore and Rs 1.22 crore, respectively, as fines from developers and individuals for green norm violations in the past two years. The district pollution control department has also recovered Rs 80 lakh as fines from violators during this period. /However, not a single agency has been able to use the money till now.A senior Noida Authority official told TOI on Tuesday they collected fines to the tune of Rs 2.20 crore in the past two years and written to NGT for directions on use of the ""green fund"". But the Authority is still waiting for a response from the green tribunal. ""Teams have been formed to conduct enforcement drives as per Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) guidelines in all 10 work circles. The Authority has also ensured a ban on construction as per EPCA guidelines, ban on hot-mix plants, and water sprinkling on construction sites. We are also conducting mechanical sweeping of roads. We have also planned a massive drive to plant 1.7 lakh saplings across the city on November 17,"" said Rajveev Tyagi, Authority general manager. KK Gupta, additional CEO of Greater Noida Authority, said they have also collected Rs 2.60 crore as fines from violators of green norms. ""The money can be used for green projects. We will take a call on how to use them,"" he said.Yamuna Authority is also not clear on how to use the green fund. ""In the past two years, YEIDA has recovered Rs 1.22 crore as fines. But the money has not been used for development work,"" said Devendra Balyan, general manager (projects).Experts say air pollution has triggered a public health emergency in Delhi-NCR and it's high time that authorities used the ""green fund"" worth over Rs 7 crore. ""The local administration can set up pollution monitoring systems. They can also use the funds to augment public transport. The funds can also be used on eco-friendly transport systems like e-rickshaws,"" said Vivek Chattopadhyaya, programme manager (air pollution control) at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).

"No escape from pollution, building sites kicking up dust in Manesar","GURUGRAM: No mitigation plan has been enforced in Manesar so far even though a Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report shows that the industrial hub is one of the most polluted areas in the city, a reality check by TOI has revealed.It has been found that the construction norms specified by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEF & CC) are being violated brazenly in new sectors - sectors 76, 77, 81, 82, 83 and 84 - and on Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway and Delhi-Jaipur Expressway at a time when the pollution levels hover between 'poor' and 'severe' categories in NCR for more than two weeks now. Uncarpeted roads, open dumping of construction and demolition waste and garbage burning are major sources that spike toxic air levels in the area, according to experts and residents.While several construction sites were found to be violating the pollution rules by not covering the construction materials in these sectors, trucks were spotted transporting uncovered building materials on NH-8 and KMP Expressway. Also, dumping of construction and demolition waste is going on unabated at eight spots on Delhi-Gurugram Expressway between Naharpur and Kherki Daula.Residents on the stretch claimed that the graded response action plan (GRAP) measures were not enforced fully in the area even though civic bodies had been making tall claims of implementation of anti-pollution steps. /They reiterated that dirt roads which have not been carpeted with bitumen or gravel, and uncovered construction sites were the major sources of air pollution in Manesar.""As soon as one enters Manesar from Gurugram, he or she will find dust and haze. It is due to massive construction activities going on in new sectors. As you move beyond the base of National Security Guard (NSG), air gets cleaner. If the authorities make sure that construction norms are followed in new sectors, air pollution levels will come down here,"" said Uday Srivastava, a resident of Sector 84. Many others blamed dumping of construction waste and garbage burning for making the situation worse. ""While waste burning is reported from several areas in Gurugram, such acts are going unchecked in Manesar. Waste is set on fire every day in our sector. Waste dumping can also be seen anywhere along with the national highway. These are also two potential sources of air pollution,"" said Ritwik, a resident of Sector 77. Experts, on the other hand, said diesel gensets are one of the major contributors to rising air pollution in Manesar. ""Nothing causes air pollution as much as diesel gensets do in this area. A recent study shows that particulate matters - both PM2.5 and PM10 - have increased by 30% in residential areas owing to the use of diesel generator sets. As several residential societies haven't got power connection, diesel gensets are being used during day and night, which spikes levels of pollutants,"" said a scientist of CPCB.Some feel that the long-term measures such as increasing green cover and number of open spaces in Manesar will help combat air pollution. ""In new sectors in Manesar there is hardly any open space and park. Also, green belts have not been developed properly. If the green cover can be increased, it will help reduce carbon levels in the lower atmosphere,"" said Ashika Khanna, a resident of Sector 82, who has recently moved from Pune to the city.

Street plays and road shows will be enacted at various public venues around the city. APD Foundation, under its 'Shuddha Gaali' programme will undertake health impact assessment of air pollution on outdoor workers like street vendors and road side shop keepers. Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) will be done on this target group using portable PFT machines. Data will be collected from an estimated sample size of about 400 citizens who work alongside roads having dense traffic. This data will be further analyzed by a team of trained pulmonologists.RTO Mangaluru will release the report during a function in the first week of December, Abdullah A Rehman, project manager, APD, said. Based on previous studies undertaken by APD Foundation, Abdullah said every Manglurean produces an average of 787.85 Kg Carbon Dioxide per year. In all, 26.3% traffic police personnel in Mangaluru have restrictive lung capacity because of air pollution from vehicles, Abdullah said, referring to the study.Baikampady, Lalbagh, PVS Junction, Attavar, Bejai, Bunder, Central Market, Bunts Hostel areas have the highest pollutant contents in the air in Mangaluru. Just as city traffic police personnel, 19% of the rickshaw drivers in Mangaluru suffer from lung problems.It is the small subset of 10% of the smoke emitting vehicles that contribute maximum to air pollution by vehicles, he said, adding the above campaign will strive to address these pollution causing issues.

COPD is now a disease of non-smokers too,"PUNE: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) has become the fifth deadliest disease across the globe.COPD is always known to be a smokers disease. However, COPD among non-smokers has now become one of the major issue in developing countries, say experts.While COPD has strong correlation with smokers, recent studies have shown that there are numerous other risk factors that trigger the disease in non-smokers. Almost half the population worldwide are exposed to smoke from biomass fuel, used for cooking and heating purposes. /Hence, exposure to bio mass is the leading cause of COPD in the rural areas bringing the mortality rates higher of COPD.In urban India, 32% households still use biomass stoves, 22% use firewood, 8% use kerosene, and Rest use cleaner fuels like liquid petroleum gas or natural gas.About 50% of deaths from COPD in developing countries are attributable to biomass smoke, of which about 75% are of women. Biomass fuels like wood, animal dung cakes, crop residue, pose as great a risk as active smoking. Reportedly, an almost three-fold increase in the prevalence of COPD among women has been noticed. This, experts point out is on account of the fact that women and young girls, especially in rural areas, spend a greater time in the kitchen.More than 80 per cent homes in China, India, and sub-Saharan Africa use biomass fuel for cooking because of it easy availability. Biomass fuels produce very high levels of indoor air pollution. Most often than not, the kitchens in rural areas lack basic facilities and are poorly ventilated, exposing the homemaker to extremely high levels of gaseous pollutants and particulate matter.According to expert Azmat Karim, ""Lower living standards in a country like India has claimed many life due to COPD. It is mostly deadly because we cannot identify the disease and treat it at the right time. Especially when the patient is non-smoking the diagnosis takes longer.""

"City's air quality worst in country, lives at risk","PATNA: The air quality in Patna was the worst in the country for the second consecutive day on Tuesday as the Air Quality Index (AQI) was measured at 402. The AQI in the state capital was a notch higher on Monday as it stood at 403 and remained the highest in the country. The Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) AQI bulletin states that severe quality of air can affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases.The AQI is an assessment of the air quality taking into account eight pollutants: PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 10 micron), PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 micron), nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, ammonia and lead.Both Gaya and Muzaffarpur witnessed 'very poor' air quality on Tuesday as their AQIs stood at 376 and 391, respectively. The CPCB's AQI bulletin states that very poor quality of air can lead to respiratory illnesses after prolonged exposure.The air quality of all three major cities in Bihar was, in fact, worse than that of Delhi which is infamous for its toxic air. /The AQI of the national capital stood at 373 on Tuesday.The last time the AQI had crossed the 400-mark in Patna during November-December, 2015, the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) issued an advisory.PM2.5 or tiny soot-like particles, which can invade lungs and trigger respiratory diseases and even cancer, have been the biggest contributors of air pollution in Patna.The average level of PM2.5 in the air on Tuesday was around 264 micrograms per cubic metre, more than two-and-a-half times the corresponding daily permissible limit of 100 micrograms per cubic metre. By and far, suspended dust particles, construction activities and vehicular emission have been linked to higher levels of suspended particulate matter (PM2.5) in the state capital.Experts claim that meteorological factors also play a role in worsening of air quality in winter season. ""The high level of air pollution being witnessed in Patna these days is because of the thermal inversion and topographical features. During winters, when the temperature dips, the mixing height (height to which the wind rises) comes down and wind speed reduces which results in trapping of pollutants and further builds them up. This is typical of the winter season and is bound to happen,"" said Ankita Jyoti, senior programme officer at Centre for Environment and Energy Development.According to health experts, particulate matter can lead to a number of health hazards and even cause cancer. ""The finer dust particles reach the lung and cause damage to the respiratory system. Common diseases caused by high levels of air pollution include allergic reaction to the lungs, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis, sinus blockage and asthma, among others,"" said city-based physician Dr Diwakar Tejaswi.

Mazgaon pollution worse than Delhi'sas AQI soars to 415,"Mumbai: Even as the bad air quality in the national capital has grabbed all attention, Mumbai's Mazgaon breached the 'severe' category on Tuesday. The AQI (air quality index) in that area, as monitored by SAFAR (System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research), was 415 on Tuesday evening. It has been consistently high for the past few days owing to construction activity.An AQI beyond 401 is considered to be severe and all citizens are advised to avoid any outdoor physical activity. /People with heart or lung diseases and older adults and children must not exert at all and remain indoor, says the health advisory by SAFAR. ""Health warning of emergency conditions, serious risk of respiratory effects even in general public,"" read SAFAR's health risk index. SAFAR has forecast the AQI to further worsen to 481 on Wednesday. Delhi's AQI on Tuesday was 358.""Mazgaon is a location-specific issue. There is huge construction activity in the area and hence additional dust is in the air. With already existing low temperatures, wind patterns and fog, the air pollution levels have peaked. The air quality is likely to improve in the next 48 hours,"" said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR.Meanwhile, the city's overall AQI was 211 on Tuesday evening. An AQI between 201 and 300 is considered poor and people with heart or lung disease, older adults and children should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion. Mumbai's overall air quality has been fluctuating in the 'poor' and 'very poor' categories due to the easterly winds which is carrying a lot of dust. The city's PM 2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns) was 121 gm (microgrammes per cubic metre), as against the safe limit of 60 gm.On Monday, Mazgaon's AQI was 352 which is considered very poor. Similarly, on November 6, 10 and 13, the AQI was 327, 329 and 315, respectively. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pollution has Ahmedabad in a killer choke-hold,"AHMEDABAD: The minute you step outside your house, vehicular fumes hit you. As you go further, under-construction roads or building add to the particulate matter you breathe in. These suspended particles come from waste burning and industrial activities. /As the world marks Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Day on Wednesday, to raise awareness about the risks one faces on a daily basis, experts stress on the rising burden of COPD.Dr Tushar Patel, a city-based pulmonologist, said this is COPD season in Gujarat and Ahmedabad, as pollution levels are generally higher during and after Diwali. ""A number of other ailments are caused by pulmonary diseases and one has to be careful. We are seeing more patients than we used to a decade ago,"" he said.India is home to 14 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world, experts pointed out, and pollution is leading to diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Air pollution also contributes or is a risk factor leading to 3.3% of all cancers, and 43% of lung cancers, they added.From ICMR and Lancet studies32% of Gujarat population is at risk of respiratory diseases. According to the Gujarat Disease Burden Profile for 1990 to 2016, tuberculosis, lower respiratory tract infection and COPD were second, third and fourth, respectively, on the list of diseases causing most years of life lost in males and females. In Gujarat, the percentage of citizens facing danger from ambient particulate matter (PM 1, PM2.5 and PM 10) is higher than the number of citizens smoking in Gujarat.Not just outdoor particulate pollution, nearly 19% of Gujaratis face COPD risk from household air pollution, owing to the lack of access to clean cooking fuels, while 7.5% of the population is exposed to risks of ambient ozone pollution and 15% is exposed to occupational particulate matter. Air pollution in Gujarat has worsened. Air pollution was the third leading cause of death and disability, accounting for 10.9%. The same study showed that COPD has now become the second leading cause of death and disability, accounting for 4.9% of deaths and disability in Gujarat. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'COPD cases have doubled in Trichy over the past two decades',"Trichy: The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) over the past two decades has doubled in Trichy, claimed experts here on Wednesday. They added that particularly among habitual smokers in the city, the prevalence of the disease was around 15% to 16%. Doctors said the increase in air pollution also majorly contributed to the increase in the number of COPD cases in the city.A COPD medical camp was conducted by Tamil Nadu Asthmaa and Allergy Research Foundation (TAARF) in the city on the occasion of World COPD Day on November 21. COPD is a chronic inflammatory lung disease, which obstructs airflow from the lungs. The most common forms of COPD are emphysema and chronic bronchitis. /It is a slowly progressive chronic disease and for the condition to manifest and become a disease in a patient, it might take up to 10 to 20 years. There are four stages of COPD - while in the first and the second stage, the disease wouldn't be as evident as a patient would suffer from cough and cold, only in the third stage, breathlessness would start to increase.According to the director of TAARF Dr G Kamal, around 200 people per month on an average get treatment for COPD at his centre. ""This is 25% to 30% more than the number of cases I used to treat five years back. Based on various reports and studies I've come across I can safely say that COPD cases have doubled in Trichy in the last 20 years,"" he told TOIExperts say that pulmonary rehabilitation is one of the most effective treatment procedures for COPD patients.""Over the years, I've been seeing an increase in the number of COPD cases due to pollution. I would urge everyone to keep their surroundings as clean as possible and also avoid being in dust-prone areas for a long time,"" says Dr S Palaniappan, head of ENT department at K A P Viswanatham Government Medical College. And added that the disease might turn life-threatening if not treated on time For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Road work near sensor sends air pollution levels sky high in Mazgaon,"Mumbai: Alarming pollution levels at Mazgaon continued to breach the 'severe' category levels for the second day in a row, according to System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). The high levels were not due to heavy construction in the area, as attributed by SAFAR, but a result of minor road work right next to the monitoring station. SAFAR said the Air Quality Index (AQI) was 432 on Wednesday morning and improved to 401 in the evening. An AQI beyond 401 is considered to be 'severe' and everyone should avoid outdoor physical activity. /People with heart or lung diseases and older adults and children must not exert and remain indoors, SAFAR health advisory said. SAFAR researchers had attributed the high pollution levels to heavy construction activity in the area and called for it to be reduced. When a TOI photographer visited the monitoring station at John Baptista Gardens on Wednesday, he did not find any major construction sites in the station's vicinity. There was cement, sand and other construction material stacked up for road work outside the monitoring station. BMC guards stationed at the garden said road work was being carried out. SAFAR engineer Vikram Kadam said the close proximity of the construction had resulted in the spike in pollution levels. ""A building is being constructed right next to the station and wind is carrying dust from material kept there. This is a local, temporary problem and will be resolved once the activity is completed,"" he said. Local residents too said they had not experienced bad air. ""We have not seen high pollution levels or had trouble breathing in the past few days,"" said local corporator Yashwant Pawar. Air pollution experts said such hyper-local factors could sometimes throw off levels but the incident is an indicator of the kind of pollution caused by construction activity. ""The monitoring station is permanent and construction activity in close proximity can impact readings. But it shows that construction dust can be harmful, and it is necessary to follow guidelines, like sprinkling water to ensure this does not impact one's health,"" said Avick Sil, regional director at Environment Policy and Research India (EPRI).Meanwhile, the overall air quality index, which is the average of readings from nine monitoring stations in Mumbai and one in Navi Mumbai continued to remain in the poor category. Wednesday evening's AQI was 237. An AQI of 201-300 is considered poor and people with heart or lung disease, older adults and children should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion. Andheri and Malad recorded an AQI in the very poor category (301-400) and the least polluted was Navi Mumbai with an AQI of 95. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Gurgaon air 'very poor', blame it on change in wind direction","GURUGRAM: After six days of 'poor' air days, the city's air quality index (AQI) spiked to 'very poor' level on Tuesday. All other NCR cities, including Delhi, also reported 'very poor' air. While AQI was recorded at 302 in Gurugram, it was logged at 373 in Delhi, 386 in Noida, 377 in Greater Noida, 396 in Ghaziabad and 380 in Faridabad.Track the pollution level in your cityThe highest level of PM 2.5 in Gurugram was recorded at 135 micrograms per cubic metre.According to the Met department, a change in the wind direction made air quality worse. /""A change of wind direction could be responsible for the deterioration of air quality in the city,"" a Met official told TOI.An official of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said the graded response action plan (GRAP) measures for the 'poor' to 'very poor' levels would be implemented only if air pollution level remained in the 'very poor' category continuously for 48 hours. ""Currently, GRAP measures for the 'poor' to 'moderate' level have been enforced in the city,"" he said.Experts and environmental activists blamed the authorities for not implementing GRAP measures properly. ""Construction activities are going on unabated in across the city. On Monday and Tuesday, I got a few videos showing immense dust pollution around construction sites, trucks carrying construction materials uncovered. Even construction sites are uncovered, which is against the pollution norms that have been enforced. The situation will worsen in the city as soon as the weather conditions become adverse,"" said Niranjan Raje, a former member of Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA).According to the forecast, Wednesday is going to remain misty and equally polluted. ""The wind is likely to blow into the city from the northwest direction, but with reduced speed. A cloudy sky, shallow fog in the morning and haze during daytime is expected on Wednesday. ""The AQI levels are expected to stay in the very poor level for next 24 hours as the wind speed is expected to go down,"" said a forecast by SAFAR.The SAFAR forecast stated that the air quality is expected to remain within the same category for the next two-three days in Delhi also.It added that the impact of stubble burning, too, has gone down considerably - meaning Delhi is only affected by localised factors. On Tuesday, contribution of stubble burning to PM 2.5 was 4%, compared to 5% on Monday. It had fallen to 1% on November 15. CPCB data showed the average PM 2.5 level was 207.1 micrograms per cubic metre at 6pm on Tuesday, while PM 10 was 361.4 micrograms.On Tuesday, the minimum temperature in Gurugram dropped to 13.2C while the maximum temperature was recorded at 29C. The average temperature is expected to hover between 28 and 12C on Wednesday. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

How to combat winter smog,"by Luke CoutinhoHolistic Lifestyle Coach-Integrative MedicineCome winter, come smog. Smog is nothing but smoke + fog, a type of outdoor air pollution that can cause particular problems for people with existing health problems, including chest, lung or heart complaints. The following changes can help in strengthening the lungs:Eliminate certain foods: Most lung disorders and infections, ranging from asthma, sinus to serious pulmonary disorders are caused due to the amount of mucus that builds up in our lungs. /It is actually our body's natural defence mechanism to trap certain bacteria and pathogens. If one is prone to snot formation, it's recommended to avoid foods that trigger its secretion like milk, gluten, refined salt, sugar, oils, corn. Cucumber and yoghurt, at night, may not suit some and should be avoided.Bring in some foods: Nature has given us some foods that can work as natural decongestants and expectorants like bromelain (pineapple extract), cayenne pepper, oregano, cardamom, mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, castor oil, garlic, onion, ginger, black pepper, raw honey. Even ajwain (Bishop's weed) works well in expelling mucus, which is why ajwain potli, which is an age-old remedy, works as well as a nebuliser.Practice yogic breathing: A lot of us don't breathe to our full capacity. We breathe short and shallow which not only creates a shortage of oxygen in our body, but also fails to effectively eliminate toxins from our body. The pranayamic style of breathing, which teaches us ways to control our inhale and exhale is one of the most sought-after ways to improve lung health. Yogic techniques like Anulom vilom, Bhastrika, Kapalbhati really help. In yoga, these are also called shuddhi kriyas, because they help in cleansing and detoxification. For maximum benefits, one should note that the exhale must be longer than the inhale, preferably in the ratio of 1:2 (inhale: exhale).Purify your home: Add some natural air purifiers into your living space like plants, blocks of activated charcoal, pink Himalayan salt lamp n Cut down the overall usage of chemically loaded household products n Refrain from smoking (both active and passive) n Take regular steam inhalations with turmeric powder and a few drops of eucalyptus/pine oil n Invest in an air humidifier n Exercising regularly helps build lungs that are strong enough to combat winter smog.In air filters, the activated charcoal absorbs many types of allergens and pollutants, leaving the air fresh and clean.

Drive against smoky vehicles from today,"PATNA: The state transport department will launch a campaign from Monday to seize vehicles that emit excessive smoke in a bid to curb air pollution in Patna. City residents have been urged to make videos or take photographs of such vehicles and send a WhatsApp message on 6202751158 and 9572506129 to the district transport officer from November 25.A decision in this regard was taken by the transport department at the recent road safety council committee meeting. While making a video or clicking a photo, people should ensure that the vehicle number is clearly visible.According to transport secretary Sanjay Agarwal, a flying squad team, under a motor vehicle inspector and an enforcement sub-inspector, has also been constituted to check the fitness of commercial and private vehicles and take stern action against drivers for violating the Motor Vehicles Act.""The flying squad will verify whether the complaints are true. /Residents can also call on the numbers provided by the department. Their identity will not be disclosed,"" Agarwal told this newspaper on Saturday.The department has bought four pollution checking machines that will be used at three locations - Hartali Mor, Saguna Mor and Bypass road. ""As part of the campaign, officials will cancel the fitness and permit certificates of the commercial vehicles which exceed the pollution limit. They will be seized and their owners will pay penalty. As far as private vehicles are concerned, they will be fined for violating the norms and receive notice to make necessary changes for reduced emissions,"" said Agarwal.Residents hailed the initiative of the transport department. Kumhrar resident Kshitij Sahni said pollution caused by old vehicles was more harmful than by dust particles. He appreciated the government for taking measures to curb air pollution.Boring Canal Road resident Surendra Pal also praised the government's decision. He said, ""The main source of air pollution in Patna is emission of black smoke, especially from buses and auto-rickshaws. It has an adverse impact on public health and the environment.""

US economist says air pollution makes lives shorter by 8 years in Rohtak,"Rohtak: Noted US economist Michael Greenstone on Tuesday has said a person staying in Rohtak could live up to eight years longer if the air quality was kept within the standards prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). He said air pollution was a bigger threat to life than smoking and drug abuse but its long-term impact were often ignored.Greenstone was speaking at the Chaudhary Ranbir Singh memorial lecture organised by Maharishi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak. Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his son Rohtak MP Deepender Hooda were also present.Greenstone is a professor at the University of Chicago and had served as the chief economist for US President Barack Obama's council of economic advisers.Greenstone's study indicates that the average particulate matter (PM) 2.5 concentration in Rohtak was 95, which was almost 10 times higher than limits prescribed by the WHO and only marginally lower than the 114 of New Delhi. He said the national average for India was 54, more than five times the WHO standards.""Around the world today, people are breathing air that represents a serious risk to their health. /But the way this risk is communicated is very often opaque and confusing, translating air pollution concentrations into colours, like red, brown, orange, and green. What those colours mean for people's well-being has always been unclear,"" said Greenstone.""My colleagues and I developed the AQLI, where the 'L' stands for 'life,' to address these shortcomings. It takes particulate air pollution concentrations and converts them into perhaps the most important metric that exists - life expectancy,"" Greenstone added.Speaking on the occasion, Deepender, who also brought in a private members bill on Right to Clean Air, said declining air quality has already reached dangerous levels and it is time we took a more coordinated approach towards solving the problem. He said that Rohtak's proximity to the national capital was one of the main reasons why people in the area continue to suffer and the problem was expected to get worse if immediate steps were not taken.

Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his son Rohtak MP Deepender Hooda were also present.Greenstone is a professor at the University of Chicago and had served as the chief economist for US President Barack Obama's council of economic advisers.Greenstone's study indicates that the average particulate matter (PM) 2.5 concentration in Rohtak was 95, which was almost 10 times higher than limits prescribed by the WHO and only marginally lower than the 114 of New Delhi. He said the national average for India was 54, more than five times the WHO standards.""Around the world today, people are breathing air that represents a serious risk to their health. /But the way this risk is communicated is very often opaque and confusing, translating air pollution concentrations into colours, like red, brown, orange, and green. What those colours mean for people's well-being has always been unclear,"" said Greenstone.""My colleagues and I developed the AQLI, where the 'L' stands for 'life,' to address these shortcomings. It takes particulate air pollution concentrations and converts them into perhaps the most important metric that exists - life expectancy,"" Greenstone added.Speaking on the occasion, Deepender, who also brought in a private members bill on Right to Clean Air, said declining air quality has already reached dangerous levels and it is time we took a more coordinated approach towards solving the problem. He said that Rohtak's proximity to the national capital was one of the main reasons why people in the area continue to suffer and the problem was expected to get worse if immediate steps were not taken.

How to protect your skin from pollution,"Our face is the most exposed body part and the growing air pollution can take a toll on the skin. Air pollution is the contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere, as defined by the WHO. In other words, it's anything that enters into the air that wouldn't otherwise be there. /Major air pollutants having detrimental effects on the skin include solar ultraviolet radiation, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, ozone and even smoking. The side effects of air pollution are varied, but perhaps the most well documented is skin ageing causing wrinkles and loss of skin elasticity. Exposure to smog can also lead to acne, dryness or rashes. With the growing pollution and its negative effects, here's how you can protect your skin by following these simple tips shared by Dr Reshma Vishnani: Sun protectionCover your face with broad-spectrum (UVA and UVB) sunscreen with minimum SPF 30. Apply it 20 minutes before leaving the house and make sure you apply it every 2.5 hours. Cleanse and Moisturize Help your skin combat the dryness caused by pollution by using moisturizers to keep your skin soft and hydrated which helps in minimizing fine lines and wrinkles. Studies have shown that pollution aggravates conditions like eczema and psoriasis, for which one should moisturise more often. For cleansing, use a gentle cleanser and make sure you wash your face at least twice or thrice a day. Also, remember to always remove your make-up! Cleansing skin is extremely important to avoid acne breakouts.Eat healthyEat a diet rich in vitamins and minerals. Fresh fruit, vegetables, and nuts are typically high in antioxidants, a potent anti-ageing substance. Vitamins A, C, and E are all powerful antioxidants. They are found in several foods, in particular blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, green leafy vegetables, beans and nuts. - You can also use topical creams containing vitamin C and E formulations and hexanol, after consulting a dermatologist. - Most importantly, take time out for yourself and visit a dermatologist who can suggest an appropriate regimen for you.

"In Karnataka, 4 diagnosed with a respiratory problem every minute","BENGALURU: With administrations struggling to tackle increased levels of air pollution arising from vehicular emissions and unscientific management of greenery, citizens in the state seem to be bearing the brunt.In Karnataka, four people are diagnosed with a respiratory disorder every minute, while at least one person dies because of a respiratory ailment every five days. Analysis of data from the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBHI) shows that in 2017 alone, the state reported 22.5 lakh cases of respiratory disorders. It claimed 75 lives. /In 2016, the number of cases was fewer than 2017 (20.7 lakh), but the number of deaths was higher (105).Although not all respiratory disorders are caused by air pollution, doctors and experts say the poor quality of air is a prime reason for the increasing number of such ailments. Arguing that air pollution not only allows microbes to proliferate but also cause allergies in humans - these in turn trigger secondary bacterial infections - doctors say that a good diet and reduced exposure is the only way forward.Water pollutionBad air is not the only concern. Separate data shows nearly 21 lakh cases of waterborne diseases were reported in 2016 and 2017. These diseases claimed 47 lives.Doctors say a majority of these deaths could have been prevented given the huge advances in healthcare and the fact that vaccines are available for diseases like typhoid and hepatitis.Dr Gangadhar Belavadi, who has practised for 34 years with government hospitals, had told TOI earlier that a majority of these deaths are from rural India. ""There are vaccines available for typhoid and hepatitis and cures for other diseases,"" Belavadi said. ""But deaths occur mostly because people delay treatment or a lack of access to healthcare facilities."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'50% of lung COPD due to air pollution',"AHMEDABAD: As the smog in Delhi is providing a perilous picture of urban cityscape in India, pulmonologists point out that pollution has increased the number of patients of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the country.""Earlier, COPD was closely associated with smoking tobacco. But today, only 20% of the cases are related to smoking - remaining part of the population is getting COPD due to other factors. /We believe that over half of the cases are caused by air pollution,"" said Dr Sundeep Salvi, director of Pune-based Chest Research Foundation (CRF).Salvi was a speaker at the 20th edition of National Conference on Pulmonary Diseases (Napcon) in the city where over 3,000 doctors from India and abroad have participated.Dr Dhruva Chaudhry, head of pulmonary & critical care medicine at Rohtak's University of Health Sciences, said that we often forget that ambient air quality also matters when we are indoors. ""In 2012, India reported about 67,000 cases of lung cancer. By 2020, the number is expected to rise to 80,000. We have to take radical steps to improve air quality and make policy-level changes such as introducing BS6 for vehicles,"" he said.Dr Tushar Patel, organizing secretary of the event, said that the experts discussed issues such as pneumonia, TB, asthma, lung and pulmonary complications and latest research for their cure.

"British Raj-era chimney law smoked out, to be killed","KOLKATA: An environment law that was introduced in Bengal during the British Raj and allowed smoke inspectors unfettered access to homes and factories to check whether chimneys were spewing out noxious fumes, is set to be repealed 113 years after it was enacted.Though the law has for all purposes been defunct for decades, Victorian literature has kept alive the saga of chimneys and their heartless cleaners, chimney sweeps, men who sent up children as young as four up hot chimneys to clean up the soot.In Charles Dickens's 'Oliver Twist', young Oliver is saved by a magistrate from the clutches of a vicious chimney sweep called Gamfield. English poet William Blake portrayed chimney sweeps in both 'Songs of Innocence' and 'Songs of Experience'. Chimney sweeps also inspired Michael Crichton's novel 'The Great Train Robbery' and Charles Lamb's essay 'The Praise of Chimney-Sweepers'. The practice came to an end in the UK through a legislation in 1875.The Bengal Smoke-Nuisance Act came into being much later in 1905, the year the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, announced the Partition of Bengal.It aimed to curb ""nuisance arising from the smoke of furnaces or fire-places in the towns and suburbs of Calcutta and Howrah"".Along with a detailed definition on smoke, the law made it mandatory for permission to be sought before setting up chimneys and furnaces. /Any breach could lead to a month in prison along with a fine of Rs 2,000.A second offence could result in a fine of Rs 5,000 and two months in jail.Following the Act, the West Bengal Smoke Nuisances Commission was set up and a chief inspector-smoke nuisances and several deputies were appointed to enforce it across the state.The law allowed the commission to fix the permissible smoke density for coke used in chimneys and furnaces. If the smoke was of greater density than permitted, and found to be hanging at a lower altitude, the smoke inspectors were empowered to take penal measures and even demolish the chimneys.'Old smoke law is irrelevant now'What was draconian about the law was that the smoke inspectors could enter anywhere at any time of the day without prior notice, if they felt the law was being flouted. The only exception was if the home owner was a woman who customarily didn't appear in public. In such cases, the inspector was required to serve a notice so that she withdrew from the scene to allow the inspection.""The 1905 law is largely irrelevant now. Use of coke in homes has been discontinued since 80s. Large-scale production and usage of coke, or coal, now falls within the ambit of other laws and central environmental regulations. A bill to repeal it will be introduced in the assembly soon,"" said a senior environment department official. The state law department and the Centre have already given the nod for its abolition.Some environmentalists though wonder if the Act should really be repealed and suggest it be amended to create smoke inspectors who go around checking the burning of garbage, litter and dry vegetation in public places across the city in winter, adding to the city's ambient air pollution.

"Where black is the colour of life, and kids go grey","Contrary to its name, there is nothing glittering or golden about Sonbhadra. The dominant colour is black. The leaves are black, so is the ground. Black soot covers classroom floors, textbooks, water left in a bucket overnight and the lungs of infants and adults alike.About 180km from Varanasi with its new highway, glitzy airport and talk of development, dreams go to die. /Welcome to Singhrauli zone, a 150sq km area covering 269 villages, spread over Uttar Pradesh's Sonbhadra and Madhya Pradesh's Singhrauli districts. This is home to the most toxic cocktail of coal dust-laden air, effluent-contaminated water and heavy metal-poisoned soil.In Delhi, as PM2.5 and PM10 levels shoot up, residents start talking about leaving the city. Emergency measures are taken to control vehicular emissions, schools are shut, and panicky parents rush to buy anti-pollution masks. In Sonbhadra, life goes on as usual. Old rumbling trucks spewing black smoke and carrying coal and stones from quarries roar up and down the highways, while aluminum and cement factories and thermal power plants throw up billowing clouds of black smoke day and night.Ask 33-year-old Vindeshwari Singh, resident of Anpara, a village whose only claim to fame is the 3,830MW Anpara Thermal Power Station. In the last couple of years, Vindeshwari's daughters have been beset with health problems: 14-yearold daughter Ayushi has a skin rash, 8-year-old Pari's hair has turned grey while 3-year-old Prakriti gets breathless after just a short run. ""Hamari zindagi barbaad hai (our life is destroyed). The air and everything around us is so polluted that if you had a year to live anywhere else, you have only six months in Anpara,"" she says.Vindeshwari has to take her children for treatment every month to a hospital in Singhrauli, spending Rs 700-800 on every visit. Her husband, a factory worker, only earns Rs 13,000 a month. ""Every visit takes the whole day. But no one is getting better. Ayushi wants to be a doctor. I want all of them to study further but I worry that their bodies may not be able to keep pace with their dreams,"" she says frowning at the youngest.It's the story of every family in Anpara. Trishala Singh, 15, has fainting spells because of weakness and anaemia. Her parents have banned her from any form of sport or physical activity after she fainted in school. Her father Dasmas Singh says it took her some days to recover. ""But she is so weak that we are always fearful,"" he says. At 35, Singh has lost all his hair. His wife suffers from high blood pressure and thyroid problems.Residents suffer from diseases ranging from mild breathing problems to skin diseases, and even cancer. Dr R V Singh, who practises in Sonbhadra, says air Patna pollution caused by coal dust has a huge impact on people's health. ""Everything from lung infection to skin diseases has grown rapidly in the last couple of years. But no policy action has been taken. Are our lungs made differently here than of those living in Delhi?"" he asks.In the Anpara middle school, principal Janak Lali Mishra says that students often complain of difficulty in breathing and rashes. ""In the mornings, it feels as if the air will choke us. If adults feel like this, you can only imagine how much worse off the children are,"" she says.The environment ministry had declared Singhrauli a critically polluted area in 2009 yet has dragged its feet over corrective policy measures. Social worker Jagatnarayan Vishwakarma, who petitioned the National Green Tribunal in 2014, says there have been a series of committees to assess the extent of damage caused by industrialisation and coal mining in the region. As recently as January 2018, the NGT asked for a committee to oversee remedial measures. Perturbed by the lack of progress, in August, the tribunal appointed a former high court judge to monitor the progress.Anil Gautam, research head at the People's Science Institute, Dehradun, has conducted extensive studies in the region over the last two decades. Along with air pollution, he says, the concentration of mercury and heavy metals has been on the rise with industrial expansion.Outside the primary health centre in Dibulganj near Anpara, mechanic Kadam Rasool is headed home after a long morning with the doctor. His 4-year-old son Irshad has a rash while his wife is asthmatic. It is one of his weekly trips to the medical centre. ""We can use purified water but you can't stop breathing,"" he says.As smog tightens its grip on Delhi, some people have already booked tickets for cleaner climes. But for Anpara's Vindeshwari, this is not an option. ""Where will I go? This is home,"" she says. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Breathing, in a time of pollution","Getting a device that measures pollution turns nameless fears into numbers. Doubt turns into a quantitative fact. Air turns certifiably into poison. Some illusions die quickly. Open green spaces do not necessarily translate into better quality of air. The home is no sanctuary. /Early mornings, celebrated in lore as the purest parts of the day, are proven to be anything but. There is the unmistakable sense of living in a prison that cannot be escaped from. As in cancer, where life itself turns against you, when the air you breathe starts killing you, the feeling of being trapped is inescapable. The good news is that the air purifier is put to test and found to be effective. In a few minutes, the PM2.5 levels recede significantly. The bad news is that there is only so much it can do, given the extent of the problem. After all, what is a catastrophic crisis in any other part of the world is a good day in Delhi, and several other cities in the country.Not surprisingly, air purifier sales have gone up, but surprisingly, only by a reported 30%. Admittedly, these devices don't come cheap, but with screaming headlines every day, one would have thought that these would be flying off the shelves at a much faster rate. Is it apathy, or simply a sense of helplessness in the face of a problem too large to come to grips with?The problem is that pollution is that kind of problem. Unlike the smokestacks that spewed out visibly contaminated air, the pollution in today's times takes on a more devious form. Of course, there are days where the smog is so acrid that your eyes smart and so thick that you can carve it with a knife, but otherwise dangerous levels of pollution can often exist without any great external sign. One might be able to protect oneself when one is indoors at home, but what happens when one steps out of the house? Also, the ill effects of pollution unfold after a long time, and are rarely directly attributable to it. Barring those with respiratory issues and overall vulnerability of health, for most others, pollution is an enemy that strikes in unknown ways over an unspecified period of time. As a society, we understand the idea of pollution well enough, particularly in its ritual form. It is when pollution becomes real that we struggle to grasp it.The very nature of breathing has a lot to do with the difficulty that many face in acting upon an issue like pollution. As a defining feature of life, breathing is literally the most natural thing in the world. Life kicks in with breath, and signs off when it stops. To distrust breath is to fear life itself. In fact, even to become aware of one's breath requires a great deal of effort. We become aware of our breath either when we choose to become mindful of it, as we do when we meditate, or when we have difficulty breathing. There is a reason why it is so difficult to even listen to a person with respiratory problems struggle with their breathing. The sound of a young child struggling with childhood asthma is a traumatic experience for any parent.The other time that we become aware of our breath is when we choose to focus on it. Meditation opens up a world of experiences that we are able to access by breathing mindfully. Breathing deeply and rhythmically changes the way we perceive the world. Meditation makes us realise the power of our breath, of how profoundly the involuntary act that we engage in every living moment of our existence affects the way we experience ourselves and the world outside.But now, there is a new mindfulness that we need to develop about breathing, and the problem is that being conscious of the problem does not help in any way to solve it. Air pollution defeats us because it bypasses the mechanisms that we have at our disposal to deal with external threats. The body is not equipped for it; evolution has not accounted for it. The filters in our nostrils, the cleaning capacity of our lungs have been designed for a world where human beings did not get to change the essential nature of the environment that they lived in.Human beings can handle most other threats by finding a way around them. Water, the other foundational need for the existence of life, is now routinely purified and consumed. We have found a way to adjust to our changed circumstances in this case, largely because it is possible to do so. Unlike breathing, we are not drinking all the time. There is a sense of helplessness that pervades the pollution discourse. It needs steps of a kind that are precisely the ones that India finds most difficult to implement. Tackling a problem of this nature requires the simultaneous and very granular workings of a host of different bodies. Top-down regulation thrown at the problem, which is our preferred mode of dealing with any crisis, is simply not enough in this case, given that the problem involves so many sectors and such diverse constituents. Since virtually nothing works in the way that it is meant to in India, to harness such a diverse group of constituents and stakeholders in trying to solve this problem looks well-nigh impossible. It does look like we have no option but to navigate this issue the best that we can on our own. Either accept pollution as a way of life, or more accurately, its opposite. Or fight it with purifiers and masks. To fear that gives life and to shield ourselves from it all the time is the gift that we have given ourselves. On National Pollution Control Day, which is when this column has been written, all that we can see is a haze of our own making. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Curb air pollution to cut pulmonary diseases',"Ahmedabad: As a young medical trainee at a US hospital over three decades ago, Dr Atul Mehta found a practical solution when a patient had a foreign body lodged in his pulmonary system. Instead of relying on the time-consuming rigid bronchoscope which was widely used at that time, the young surgeon with the help of forceps removed the foreign body in less than five minutes.""I was criticized at that time but it set me thinking about the ways to deal with pulmonary problems in innovative ways and that was the start of interventional pulmonology for me,"" Mehta said. He was in the city recently as a keynote speaker at NAPCON 2018.Mehta said that pollution is the leading reason for pulmonary problems worldwide. /""India has to take a cue from countries like Singapore that have curbed the number of vehicles on the road,"" Mehta said. ""We need collective efforts to reduce pulmonary diseases. The efforts should be everywhere and not only in big cities. India needs to strengthen its anti-smoking drive and also push for preventive screening programmes for diseases such as TB, pneumonia and lung cancer.""A graduate of NHL Municipal Medical College at the VS Hospital in Ahmedabad, Mehta fulfilled the dream of his father to become a doctor. Born in Dahod, Panchmahal, he was educated at St Xavier's School and later at St Xavier's College. ""I was good at academics and thus my parents chose my career,"" he said jokingly, adding that if not doctor, he would have chosen a career in the Air Force. As an NCC cadet, he flew gliders in Ahmedabad.Way ahead for India Associated with prestigious Cleveland Clinic for 38 years, Mehta is now a professor of medicine and the chair of lung transplantation programme. Today, he is one of the leading pulmonologists of the US, known for his innovations and out-of-the-box approach.Talking about research and development (R&D) in the US and India, he said that it's not a fair comparison given the other challenges faced by Indian medical fraternity. ""There is lot of good work happening in the field. I am particularly excited about advances in lung transplant programmes, new treatment for pulmonary fibrosis, robotic bronchoscopy and endobronchial valve for emphysema in recent years,"" said Mehta said.

Toxic air triggers spurt in breathing ailments,"KOLKATA: The spiralling pollution levels in Kolkata over the last three weeks have resulted in a sharp spurt in the number of patients suffering from respiratory illnesses. While the gradual temperature dip is a usual trigger at this time of the year, doctors have pointed out that the severity of the diseases have been much more this year which can be linked directly to the pollution rise. Number of COPD and asthma patients - the majority of whom are children and the elderly - seeking admission in hospitals has skyrocketed to an unprecedented level since mid-November, according to some private hospitals.Belle Vue Clinic has eight COPD patients admitted which is higher than last year. /Ruby General Hospital has 24 patients in the pulmonology department, including 16 severe cases, which is unprecedented. At Fortis Hospital, the number of respiratory illness patients had touched 40 in mid-November.Doctors pointed out that the spurt was triggered by the Diwali pollution and has since remained unchanged. ""Post-Diwali, children have been streaming in with breathing problems, wheeze, cough and pneumonia. The main reason for this rise in incidence is air pollution. The sharp spurt in the number of patients suggests an increasingly strong evidence that air pollution is associated with increase in the risk of death and chronic disease in children, apart from worsening pregnancy outcomes and aggravating existing illnesses,"" said paediatrician and NICU in-charge at Fortis Hospital Sumita Saha.""In addition, children spend more time outdoors where the concentrations of pollution from traffic, power plants and other combustion sources are generally higher. Air pollution, particularly traffic-related pollution and fireworks triggers asthma and atopy,"" added Saha. While COPD is an irreversible narrowing of the airway passages, in asthma the narrowing can be reversed.The severity of the disease has indeed been rising every year and has reached an unprecedented level this time, said AMRI Hospital consultant Debashish Saha. ""Vehicular pollution and fireworks could be the reasons. It is evident from the severity of COPD and asthma cases that pollutants like sulphur-dioxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, silica and asbestos are substantially higher than ever before. While the immediate impact has been a rise in the number of COPD and asthma patients, in the long run these could cause lung cancer,"" said Saha.Asthma and allergy due to pollution have reached an alarming level with almost one out of every four kids affected by these, claimed paediatrician Santanu Ray. ""Both the number of patients and the severity of the ailments have gone up. This is evident from the number of hospitalizations this year which is at least 40% higher,"" said Ray.The situation could worsen as the month progresses, said Fortis Hospital consultant Angshuman Mukherjee. ""As the temperature drops, the cases could get more severe. This year we had an early spurt in November. There is thankfully a lull now but we expect another surge,"" he said.

Air pollution linked to 12.4L deaths in India in '17: Report,"NEW DELHI: One in every eight deaths in India is attributable to air pollution, which now contributes to more disease burden than smoking.In fact, the average life expectancy in India would have been 1.7 years higher if the air pollution level were less than the minimal level, shows the first comprehensive estimates of deaths, disease burden, and life expectancy reduction associated with air pollution in each state of India, released by the Indian Council of Medical Research on Thursday.Around 77% of India's population is exposed to outdoor air pollution levels above the National Ambient Air Quality Standards safe limit, the report says.States in east and north India had some of the highest levels of both ambient particulate matter and household air pollution, especially Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Jharkhand. Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab in north India had some of the highest ambient particulate matter pollution exposure in the country.In 2017, air pollution accounted for 12.4 lakh deaths in India, which included 6.7 lakh deaths due to outdoor particulate matter air pollution and 4.8 lakh deaths due to household air pollution. Over half of the deaths due to air pollution were in persons less than 70 years of age, the report said. With 18% of the global population, India suffered 26% of premature mortality and health loss attributable to air pollution globally.The report, published in the Lancet Planetary Health, assumes significance as it follows several such reports by the World Health Organisation which have already detailed the major health risks posed by foul air in the country.A special report released by WHO on Wednesday at COP 24 said India can get massive health gains- up to $8 trillion by pursuing global warming limit of 1.5 C. The UN agency had recently also linked air pollution with increasing child mortality. /In 2017, India witnessed 1,10,000 premature deaths of children due to air pollution, highest in the world in the category of children under five years of age.The India State-Level Disease Burden, conducted jointly by ICMR along with the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in collaboration with the health ministry, shows a marked variation between the states, with a 12 times difference for ambient particulate matter pollution and 43 times difference for household air pollution.However, the report recognises the increasing public and policy attention to control air pollution in India. ""It is important to have robust estimates of the health impact of air pollution in every state of India in order to have a reference for improving the situation. Household air pollution is reducing in India, facilitated by the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana. There is increasing political momentum in India to address air pollution. The findings reported today systematically document the variations among states, which would serve as a useful guide for making further progress in reducing the adverse impact of air pollution in the country,"" Dr Balram Bhargava, secretary health research said.Systematic and sustained efforts are needed to address the variety of sources contributing to air pollution, which include transport vehicles, construction activity, industry and thermal power emissions, residential and commercial solid fuel use, waste and agriculture burning, diesel generators, and manual road dust sweeping, the report said.It highlighted that apart from respiratory diseases, pollution also causes ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer, commonly associated with smoking.Prof. Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences said, ""The upsurge in respiratory problems in the winter months with peak air pollution is well known, but what is now also becoming better understood is that air pollution is a year-round phenomenon particularly in north India which causes health impacts far beyond the seasonal rise of respiratory illnesses. Air pollution is now the leading risk factor for chronic obstructive lung disease in India, and a major contributor to pneumonia and lung cancer. This study provides the most comprehensive estimates of the adverse health impact of outdoor and indoor air pollution in each state of India so far, which would serve as a valuable resource for planning air pollution reduction in all parts of India.""

More people died due to bad air in Maha than Delhi last yr,"Mumbai: While the focus of bad air level is on the national capital, an India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative study has revealed that pollution-related death rate in Maharashtra was much higher than in Delhi in 2017. The death rate per a population of one lakh in Maharashtra was 86.7 against Delhi's 65.3 last year. The report, published in Lancet Planetary Health journal, also shows that over one lakh deaths in Maharashtra were attributable to air pollution, second only to Uttar Pradesh. By comparison, Delhi recorded 12,322 such deaths in 2017.On the presence of harmful particulate matter in the air, the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 says the population-weighted mean for PM 2.5 ug/m3-average exposure of less than 2.5 microns-was 209 in Delhi, the highest in the country. /On the other hand, the PM 2.5 mean for Maharashtra was 55.7 ug/m3. While lower than Delhi, Maharashtra's PM 2.5 levels were much above the national safe limit of 40 ug/m3. Particulate matter of the size 2.5 microns can easily enter the lungs and cause ailments.Authors of the report attribute higher death rate in Maharashtra to population concentration in cities and extensive use of solid fuels in homes. ""Population concentration in big cities such as Mumbai, Pune and Nashik is a factor in calculating the death rate. In several districts, use of solid fuel is quite high and this way you end up exposing people to both ambient and household pollution. That is not the case in Delhi because it has primarily an urban population. Delhi's baseline mortality rate is also helped by the fact that overall it is an affluent city with better access to healthcare and awareness,"" said Kalpana Balakrishnan, first among the 76 authors of the study. In Maharashtra, 37.7% of population used household fuel against 1.9% in Delhi. Similarly, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to air pollution exposure is higher in the state than Delhi. DALY is a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death. A breakup of DALY attributable to ambient air pollution shows Maharashtra fare better than Delhi though. DALY rate per one lakh population attributable to ambient PM pollution is Maharashtra is 1,392 against Delhi's 2,018. The state, though, has 804 DALY rate attributable to household air pollution. In Delhi, it is as low as 13. Experts say there is a need to create awareness not only about ambient pollution but also household air pollution. ""Unfortunately, the focus of air pollution is on Delhi but most other Indian cities and states are equally polluted,"" said Dr Sundeep Salvi, Chest Research Foundation, Pune, also an author of the study. ""Children and elderly are most vulnerable. The government must take tough decisions to reduce air pollution, which may make people unhappy in the short term,"" said Salvi.

India could gain $8 trillion with climate battle,"NEW DELHI: India can get massive health benefits worth $3- $8 trillion by making efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C by the end this century, says a special report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) released at the UN climate conference in Poland.The assessment shows over 1 million lives can be saved every year worldwide from air pollution alone by 2050 by meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement. The value of the health gains is estimated to be around twice the cost of the policies, while the largest gains would be expected in China and India.China is expected to gain $0.27-2.31 trillion by pursuing the 1.5C global warming target.""The most recent evidence indicates that the gains for health to be derived from scenarios that meet the Paris goal for reduced climate warming would more than cover the financial cost of mitigation at global level and would cover it several times over in countries such as China and India,"" the report, titled 'Health & Climate Change' said.Over two million deaths occur prematurely in India due to pollution, accounting for 25% of the global deaths due to air pollution. India is closely followed by China, registering around 1.8 million pollution-related deaths.Recently, WHO has also linked India's toxic air to the premature deaths of 1,10,000 children, highest in the world in the category of children under five years of age, attributed to their exposure to ambient air pollution of particulate matter 2.5.Globally, exposure to air pollution causes seven million deaths every year, resulting in $5.11 trillion in welfare losses globally, nearly doubling the losses in 1990, the latest assessment shows.Climate change can affect human health both directly and indirectly. /The direct health impacts include physiological effects of exposure to higher temperatures, increasing incidences of non-communicable diseases such as respiratory and cardiovascular disease, injuries and death due to extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, heatwaves, storms and wildfires. Climate change also has indirect effects on health due to ecological changes, such as food and water insecurity and the spread of climate-sensitive infectious diseases, and also to societal responses to climate change, such as population displacement and reduced access to health services.""The Paris Agreement goals of limiting global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, with an absolute ceiling well below 2.0 C, are essential to protect health in the medium to long term,"" the report said.""The Paris Agreement is potentially the strongest health agreement of this century,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO.The report highlights that health gains of meeting the two degrees target would also significantly offset the costs in other regions, such as the European Union (seven-84%) and the US (10-41%).In the 15 countries that emit the most green house gases (GHGs), the health impacts of air pollution are estimated to cost more than 4% of their GDP, whereas actions to meet the Paris goals would cost around one per cent of the global GDP, the report said.

'Toxic air costing you up to 20 months',"Ahmedabad: The life expectancy of Gujarat residents reduced by 1 year and 7 months last year because of ambient air pollution or PM2.5 pollution - tiny particles of 2.5 microns from vehicular exhausts, industries and powerhouse chimneys. These particles have a diameter 30 times smaller than that of a human hair and can enter our lung air sacs and cross into our blood stream.In case of men, the life expectancy decreased by 1.8 years and it was 1.7 years in case of women. These startling facts have emerged in the latest Lancet report 'The impact of air pollution on deaths, disease burden, and life expectancy,' released on Wednesday.In 2016 alone, another Lancet study had claimed that approximately 43,000 people had died of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) while 9,000 died of chronic asthma in the state. /The figure was computed based on epidemiological transition level (ETL) - change in mortality rates brought about by medical advancements - and disability adjusted life years (DALY). But here's the real danger. In Gujarat, the percentage of citizens at risk from ambient particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5 and PM10), is nearly 32%, which is higher than proportion of people at risk from smoking. The percentage of population that faces the risk of pulmonary diseases due to smoking is 21%. Not just outdoor particulate pollution, but nearly 19% Gujaratis face COPD risk from household air pollution owing to lack of access to clean cooking fuels, while 7.5% of the population is exposed to ambient ozone pollution and about 15% is exposed to occupational particulate matter. Paryavaranmitra member Mahesh Pandya said, ""In most Gujarat cities ambient pollution can be reduced with efficient transport systems that run on clean fuels."" He adds, ""In 1991 there were 900 red AMTS buses, and today we have a combined bus fleet - BRTs and AMTS at 1,055 while population is close to 57 lakh."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Air quality 'severe' in Patna for second consecutive day,"PATNA: Air quality of Patna and other major towns of the state continues to deteriorate despite recent advisories issued by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB).The air quality index (AQI) of Patna, as per daily bulletin released by the Central Pollution Control Board, remained at a whopping 405 on the second consecutive day on Friday, putting it in the 'severe' category. According to the CPCB, severe air quality can affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases.The air quality in Patna was the fourth worst in the country on Friday. While Ghaziabad topped the chart in terms of worst air quality with an AQI of 429, Muzaffarpur, where AQI was measured at 420, stood second. /Kolkata was at third position with an AQI of 406.The air quality at Gaya in south Bihar was in 'very poor' category as it stood at 314. As per CPCB guidelines, 'very poor' category of AQI can lead to respiratory illness on prolonged exposure.The AQI is an assessment of the air quality taking into account eight pollutants - PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 10 microns), PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 microns), nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, ammonia and lead.PM2.5 has been found to be the biggest contributor to high AQI in Patna. The level of PM2.5 in the air at Patna on Friday evening was 232 micrograms per cubic metre, over two times the daily permissible limit of 100 micrograms per cubic metre.Experts attributed the surge in AQI to plunge in temperature along with misty conditions in the morning, which led to trapping of particulate matters in the lower level of atmosphere.It was in the wake of high AQI that BSPCB had on November 24 issued an advisory to district magistrates of Patna, Muzaffarpur and Gaya to take mandatory measures aimed at curbing air pollution. The advisory stipulated implementation of city-specific action plan for prevention and control of air pollution.Asked about steps being taken by the district administration to address the issue, Patna DM Kumar Ravi said, ""We have asked officials concerned, including the sub- divisional officers and different agencies, to curb air pollution by preventing the spread of dust particles in the city. Steps are also being taken to ensure strict implementation of eco-friendly construction norms, including covering construction sites with nets.""The DM said the talks were also on with the civic body for regular sprinkling of water on the roads to prevent spread of dust particles.

Schoolkids take cover behind masks as veil of morning smog shrouds Kolkata,"KOLKATA: When five-year-old Inzamamul Haque did not stop coughing and sneezing even after a week, his father consulted a paediatrician, who said it was foul air that was playing havoc with the child's respiratory tract. Ditto with six-year-old Dripto Chakraborti, whose bouts of cough had been directly linked with the high suspended particulate matter (PM) in the air.With the concentration of PM2.5, ultra-fine particules in the air that enter the lungs and the blood stream unhindered, hovering between 450 g/m3 and 500 g/m3 in the air over the past few days, school-going children are getting smothered by smog in the morning, either on way to school or in playgrounds. Doctors and environmentalists warn the toll on children could be severe and longterm.""For the past few days, I have noticed my son having difficulty breathing. I had never expected the air quality to be so poor as to affect a child's health,"" said Inzamamul's father Ehtashamul, alarmed by the condition of his son, a student of St James' School. /Young Inzamamul could not make it to school for two days because he was coughing and sneezing incessantly.Some parents, though, had sensed the deteriorating air quality and the need to take preventive measures. Children walking down with breathing masks or faces half-covered by handkerchiefs are increasingly becoming common in the morning when parents drop their children to school.Gargi Chakraborti, Dripto's mother, did not wait for a doctor to recommend a mask. She had followed the news on the spiralling air pollution in Kolkata and had an idea about the alarming rate at which the PM2.5 was shooting up. Concerned over what the pollutants may do to her son, she undertook safeguards on her own. From keeping the windowpanes of the car rolled up and the AC switched on to covering his face when he steps out, she takes every possible precaution to protect him from the pollution menace.""It was my father-in-law who first raised an alarm when my son started getting breathless in the mornings and coughing after returning home. He said it was primarily due to the high level of air pollution. Since then, I have become wary of him stepping out in the open,"" said the resident of Regent Estate in Golf Green.Air pollution, even for a short span, increases the risk of lower respiratory infections and other complications among children. Children's exposure to air pollution is a special concern because their immune systems and lungs are not fully developed when exposure begins, raising the possibility of different responses than seen in adults. In addition, children spend more time outside, where the pollution is high.Paediatrician Santanu Ray explained why children are so vulnerable to pollution. ""Since their lungs are in a formative stage, they inhale more, which means more toxic air is going in. They also get exposed to high pollution levels in the morning either while going to school or during sporting activities,"" he cautioned.The air pollution is at its peak at this moment, leading to breathing problems in even otherwise fit children. It is getting severe with those who already suffer from asthma. Many of them need interventions like nebulization or even hospitalisation. In 2017, several schools in Delhi had shut down for a few days due to the deteriorating air quality. The government had stopped all outdoor sports and other activities in schools after the medical body termed the situation a public health emergency. None of the schools in Kolkata had taken such a decision till Friday evening.""Children with asthma or chronic respiratory diseases are at a very high risk at this time with the air quality deteriorating so badly. But even those who are physically fit but exposed to such bad air are at risk. Parents must safeguard children from going to pockets where the pollution is very high. Using a breathing mask will help. It is best to avoid exposure to open air at times when the pollution count is very high,"" said Ranjan Das, chest specialist at CMRI.

Citizen's groups to raise pollution pitch,"KOLKATA: Angry over the state inaction on rising air pollution, several citizen's groups have convened a meeting at Rabindra Sarobar on Sunday morning to chalk out an action plan to wake the government up from stupor.""We are rallying for the citizen's right to breathe healthy air. Though it is the duty of the state environment department and the pollution control board to ensure that the air does not get polluted and take measures if it turns foul, neither seemed concerned. Unlike Delhi where entry of goods vehicles was banned, restrictions were put in place on use of personal vehicles and schools were shut down, there has been a deafening silence in Kolkata despite the air turning as foul as Delhi,"" said auto emission expert Somendra Mohan Ghosh.Though calls to PCB chairman Kalyan Rudra went unanswered on Friday, he is the only official to have acknowledged the problem. /""Air pollution affects everyone, from the youngest to the oldest, from the poorest to the richest. Though weather and geographic location has a major bearing on the spike in winter pollution in Kolkata, the issue has to be addressed,"" he had earlier told TOI.With the PM2.5 count consistently hovering at the hazardous level, rights groups believe it is the government's duty to publicly announce the danger that it poses to public health. ""People need to be told that they should stay indoors; that the air they breathe is so foul that it is worse than smoking,"" said Ghosh.Participants will wear masks and hold placards demanding strict monitoring of PUC certification centres, intense drive against polluting vehicles, switch to cleaner fuels or electric vehicles for public transport, phasing out of old polluting vehicles, stringent pollution norm for construction industry, use of non-permeable sheets, wind breakers and sprinkling of water at construction sites, and a strong and sustained campaign against litter and garbage burning.In the absence of government advisories, the group plans to make people aware of the danger lurking in the air and build up public opinion so that both the state government and Kolkata Municipal Corporation are forced to act.Among the attendees expected at the meet are doctors who will explain to the gathering what particulate matter pollution is and the health risks it entail. ""People are unaware that they are breathing poison. Most of the time they don't know what to do if health conditions deteriorate fast,"" said Ajay Mittal of Kolkata Clean Air.Citizen groups like SwitchON, Global Shapers, Kolkata, LP4Y, Y-East, BhoomiKa and DRCSC will be hitting the road on Sunday. ""It is pointless to put the blame only on the government. We are polluting the air. We need to be careful,"" said Ekta Kothari Jaju of SwitchON, one of the organisers.

'Raj has highest death rate per lakh due to air pollution',"Jaipur: Over 90 thousand deaths in 2017 in Rajasthan were linked to air pollution. Rajasthan has reported highest death rate per one lakh population, which is 112.5, attributable to air pollution. The average life expectancy in Rajasthan would have been 2.5 years higher, which is the highest in the country, if the air pollution levels were less than the minimal level - shows the first comprehensive estimates of deaths, disease burden, and life expectancy reduction associated with air pollution in each state of India, released by the Indian Council of Medical Research on Thursday.If the exposure to ambient particulate matter pollution had been lower than the minimum levels associated with health loss, the average life expectancy would have increased in Rajasthan by 1.1 years. /If the exposure to household air pollution due to solid fuels had been lower than the minimum levels associated with health loss, the average life expectancy would have increased in Rajasthan by one year, which is the highest in the country. Rajasthan is one of the states having highest levels of both ambient particulate matter and household air pollution. In Rajasthan, Jharkhand and West Bengal, the annual exposure to ambient particulate matter, as the population-weighted mean PM2.5 in 2017, was ranging between 81.4 microgram per metre cube to 93.4 microgram per metre cube. In India, it was 89.9 microgram per metre cube. The report, published in Lancet Journal, says that the proportion of the population using solid fuels in the country in 2017 was 55.5%. This proportion was highest in the low socio-demographic index (SDI) state group (72.1%) and highest in the low SDI states of Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha (range 76.7% to 81.5%), followed by Chhattisgarh, Assam, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan in the low SDI state group range (68% to 74.8%). Dr Virendra Singh, from Asthma Bhawan, who was the only participant from the state said, ""The highest death rate in India due to pollution was in Rajasthan. As many as 112.5 per lakh population died due to pollution in Rajasthan, while in Kerala, it was 79 per lakh. It is because Rajasthan has both indoor and outdoor pollution.""Average one year of life is lost due to pollution in Kerala, while 2.5 years' life is lost in Rajasthan. ""Just to have an idea by comparison, high BP reduces average age by five years and diabetes reduces life expectancy by 10 years,"" said Dr Singh. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
IS YOUR PET GASPING NOW?,"Friday was the cruellest day for pets in Kolkata. That's the day the city breathed the foulest air this year. On Friday, the air quality index (AQI) recorded at the automatic pollution monitoring station at the RBU campus on BT Road had shown results that shocked pet owners. The AQI had read 434. That was way above the 409 reading on Diwali night. /While humans could wear masks to avoid the hazard, ever wondered how our furry friends are dealing with the air pollution? Keeping the pooch indoors is an option but then again, it impacts their exercise regime.Actor Dev, who has two pets, one American Akita and a Cane Corso, said, ""After reading the TOI report on pollution this Saturday, I'm worried about their health. Things are only getting worse by the day. So, I've to keep them indoors. But will that be a permanent solution?"" CT checks out the precautions needed to take care of the furry and feathered friends during these difficult times.DogsBelieve it or not, dogs are more affected by air pollution than human beings. Besides, they cannot communicate about their illness. That increases the risk of things getting out of hand soon. While vehicular smoke is the most harmful, there are other kinds of smoke that affect them too. According to Dr Gautam Banerjee, a noted vet in Kolkata, since dogs have a higher breathing rate, pollutants like carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide enter their bodies more. ""Walking is a necessity for pets. In Kolkata, where both traffic and pollution are on the rise, taking your pet out for a walk is cumbersome and might affect your pooch's health,"" he said.SymptomsCoughing or gagging, difficulty in breathing (including open-mouth breathing and increased noise while breathing), eye irritation, excessive watering, inflammation of throat or mouth, nasal discharge, asthma-like symptoms and increased breathing rates are common. Rahul Nag, a pet parent to a German Shephard, said, ""Dogs have a very sensitive system. On Diwali, I saw my dog constantly coughing and trying to clear his throat. After two hours, I took him to a vet and learnt that the fumes were creating the problem. We can wear masks and stay indoors to avoid outdoor pollution. Pets don't have that option. So it is our duty to save them from pollution.""RemediesIf your dog experiences any of these symptoms, it is advisable to take him/her to the vet immediately. A dog would need some amount of daily exercise. While most experts suggest daily walks, it is counter-effective and even harmful for the dog to exercise now that the pollution level is so high. According to Dr Santanu Mukherjee, the water intake must be increased during this time to flush out pollutants from their bodies. ""Besides, pet owners must not take their dogs for a walk during the peak office hours or when the pollution level and smog are high,"" he said, suggesting that owners play with the dogs indoors. ""I recommend using a ball tied to a rope to play with the dogs at home,"" Santanu said.BirdsThere was a time when American coal miners used caged canaries as a natural carbon monoxide and methane detection system. If the birds perished or became notably distressed, it meant a serious hazard. That was a sign for immediate evacuation. Birds are very vulnerable to pollution since they have higher breathing rates and complex respiratory systems. When they are exposed to pollution in the open, birds often change their location to avoid it. ""In the morning, dry leaves and litter are often set on fire. If you minutely inspect, you won't be able to spot a single bird around in that smoky zone,"" said veterinary doctor Sidharta Ghosh. However, in captivity, the birds do not have that freedom.SymptomsLoss of weight and feather, vomiting, short breathing and mucus in the nostril. Increasing pollution often triggers various lung infections including pneumonia, respiratory diseases and pulmonary infections. Dhritiman Datta, a breeder of exotic parrots, said noise pollution can lead to heart attack. ""Breeding problems can surface too. Birds have this habit of throwing away their eggs from their nests if they are irritated by air pollution. Lung problems and heavy metal poisoning can also occur if the air pollution rate is high,"" Dhritiman said.RemediesThe precautions depend entirely on the set-up you have. If you have a small cage of birds, then place it indoor. Since sunlight and air are necessities for birds, place the cage outside once or twice in a day when the pollution level isn't high. Though there is no robust medical study to suggest that air purifiers work according to the claims made by the companies selling them, there is no harm in using one. If you have a big cage or a room full of birds, you can try using an air-purifier indoor.CatsPet cats are known to suffer health hazards from chemical pollution in the environment, often earlier than humans. Way back in 1950s, neurobehavioral symptoms were first observed in cats that consumed mercury-contaminated fish in Japan's Minamata Bay. The disturbed behaviour of suffering animals was then dubbed by locals as ""dancing cat fever"". With increasing pollution levels in Kolkata, cats are battling various kinds of problems. Modhumanti Das, who adopted three stray cats, said, ""Cats are sensitive to smoke. If you have a cat at home, avoid doing any kind of puja in the room with agarbatti and diya. Also, one should avoid smoking in front of them.""SymptomsMany of the symptoms are similar to what is seen among dogs. So, there is coughing, difficulty in breathing, eye irritation and excessive watering, nasal discharge and increased breathing rates. Besides, there will be bad odour at home if a cat is unwell. According to Dr Gautam Banerjee, a cat suffers skin problems too. ""They have a kind of asthma that is difficult to cure in Kolkata. The white fur gets discoloured too,"" he said.RemediesIf your cat is experiencing any of these symptoms for longer than three hours, take him/her to the vet immediately. According to Debesh Sandhuka, the owner of an Indian stray cat and a Persian cat, ""There is a difference in behaviour between my two cats. The Persian cat likes to stay indoors. But the stray cat goes around in the neighbourhood at least twice or thrice a day. During the monsoon and on days when pollution levels are high, we try to keep him indoors.""

"Rain predicted, but may not bring air pollution down","New Delhi: Delhi may or may not get a respite from 'very poor' air in the next couple of days even as the Met department predicts showers on Tuesday and Wednesday. If there isn't suficient rain, say experts, it may only result in an increase in pollution as the moisture will trap pollutants.Met officials said rains were expected in parts of north India, owing to an increase in moisture due to an active western disturbance and Delhi will benefit from that as well. ""This could result in an increase in minimum temperature, which is at present hovering around 8 degrees Celsius,"" said B P Yadav, deputy director general at IMD. /Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) on Sunday was recorded at 374, which is classified as 'very poor' on the CPCB's index. According to Met department, Delhi's minimum temperature may shoot up to 11 degrees Celsius by Wednesday, following a spell of light rain. Delhi had recorded the coldest day of the season so far on Saturday when the minimum temperature was at 7.6 Celsius. ""There has to be sufficient rain for the pollution to go down. If there is not enough rain, it will only result in an increase in pollution once again as the moisture will aid in trapping pollutants,"" a CPCB official said.Delhi's minimum temperature on Sunday was recorded at 8.2 degrees Celsius, while authorities have forecast a maximum and minimum of around 24 and 8 degrees Celsius respectively for Monday. ""There will be shallow to moderate fog in the morning with haze afterwards,"" said an official.In terms of air quality, NCR's average PM10 and PM2.5 levels touched close to four times the safe standard on Sunday.

State needs to press health alarm button: Experts,"Jaipur: Being a state with the highest death rate attributable to pollution in the country, reporting 90,499 deaths attributable to air pollution in 2017 and losing 2.5 years of life expectancy due to air pollution, Rajasthan has to press the health alarm button, say health experts. Unchecked air pollution, industrialisation, increasing number of vehicles and rampant mining have brought Rajasthan to a spot where health becomes a major concern.""Deaths attributable to air pollution is not like heart attack. No sudden death occurs due to air pollution. /But, rising pollution levels in the air and exposure to it deteriorate condition of patients who are already suffering from lung problems such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, silicosis and Interstitial lung disease (ILD),"" said Dr Narendra Khippal, professor (Department of Chest and Respiratory diseases), Sawai Man Singh medical college.Air pollution is a growing menace here, leading to increase in asthma, COPD and recurrent respiratory infections. However, air pollution has other serious health hazards. ""Growth of children is affected, and their immunity is reduced. The treatment of air pollution is to prevent it. We need to check the air quality level daily and plan our activities accordingly,"" said Dr Sheetu Singh, assistant professor, Institute of Respiratory Disease, SMS medical college, Jaipur.Dr Singh said, ""In case of high pollution levels is advisable to avoid exercising outdoors. If a person has a known case of asthma, he/she should take inhaler or medicines regularly to avoid asthma attack. Environment-friendly fuels should be used. Vehicles should be switched off at traffic signals. Car pooling should be done when travelling to school or work. Protective face masks maybe used. Avoid smoking especially indoors. Also avoid burning wood and trash. It is a common phenomenon that people burn garbage, it only creates more pollution. On the contrary it may be used to produce healthy manure.""The detrimental effects to health from air pollution are largely determined by the concentration of air pollutants and the amount of exposure time. ""High concentrations of ambient particles can trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction and increase hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, increase in the risk for stroke, Parkinson's disease and neuro-developmental disorders. Indoor air pollutants like formaldehyde and benzene can induce leukaemia,"" said Dr KK Sharma, pulmonologist of a private hospital.Health experts said that people should observe good living habits and regulate their daily activities according to the local air quality report. Air purifying plants such as aloe vera, ivy and spider plant can be placed at home and offices as they help purify indoor air and minimise indoor pollution. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Masked crusaders' throng Lake demanding right to clean air,"KOLKATA: On a day when Kolkata's AQI touched 428, when the safe limit is 50, various citizens' groups - pollution masks firmly in place - congregated at Rabindra Sarobar's Safari Park demanding their right to breathe. At 7pm on Sunday, PM10 became the most prominent pollutant and its count per cubic metre was 500.Organized by Kolkata Clean Air, people from all walks of life - including doctors, lawyers, students, NGO heads, businessmen and sportspersons - joined the campaign to say that citizens can't stay safe under the current conditions. The campaigners also got morning walkers to pledge following a low-carbon-footprint lifestyle.""Kolkata's air quality has reached a dangerous level with PM10 and PM2.5 counts reaching the 500 mark in the last two days, according to the Rabindra Bharati University monitoring station installed by WBPCB. In November 2018, we had 21 days of 'poor' or 'very poor' air,"" said Ajay Mittal of Kolkata Clean Air.Rajdeep P Guha, surgical oncologist, ENT specialist, head-and-neck surgeon and Vikash Agarwal, senior surgical oncologist, spoke about the importance of wearing N95 masks. /""Wearing simple cloth masks or covering the face with a handkerchief makes hardly any sense as particulate matter 2.5 is so small it can penetrate our lungs and enter our blood streams,"" Guha said.Gynaecologist Sumona Sur encouraged people to shift their workout routines to late afternoons and avoid early mornings or nights when the pollution levels are very high.Advocate Vinay Shraff said, ""The right to breathe is part of our constitutional right to life, which casts an obligation upon the state to preserve the life of every person.""Pauline Laravoire from YEast, who is from Paris but now lives in Kolkata, compared her two homes. ""Paris's AQI is 50 when Kolkata's is400. It is time to take collective action.

""All participants agreed that we citizens need to be aware of the detrimental effect of our action on our local and global environment. We were unanimous that sweeping lifestyle changes and bold policy changes were required to breathe and exercise in a healthy environment,"" one of them said.Vinay Jaju from Switch ON, an NGO partner of Kolkata Clean Air, said, ""A University of Chicago report names particulate air pollution the single greatest threat to human health globally. I was absolutely shocked to read that in India last year, one in eight deaths happened due to air pollution. We also know from the Lancet commission report that air pollution is responsible for three times more deaths than from AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined and 15 times more deaths than from all wars and other forms of violence. We have no other choice but to act urgently to curb air pollution in our city.""""Exposure to such toxic air is extremely dangerous for the citizens and can amount to a serious public health crisis,"" said another campaigner at Rabindra Sarobar.

Industry pollutants back to haunt Hyderabad,"HYDERABAD: Residents from different localities, especially those residing in the areas surrounding Balanagar industrial belt have been complaining of an unpleasant smell during the early hours and evenings. In some areas, the unpleasant smell pervades through the day and night. The strong nauseous and pungent odour emanating from the polluting industries in frequent spells is back after a brief gap.The odour is so strong from past few days, especially during evenings, that it enters even into the residential blocks and leaves the residents uncomfortable, locals said. /""The problem is felt along many of the industrial areas such as Gandhi Nagar, Soubhagya Nagar and Mythri Nagar in Balanagar, Kukatpally, Moosapet and is spreading to Sanathnagar and Erragadda as well. The problem is not so apparent during the day but in evenings it becomes unbearable,"" said Raghunath Patil, a resident of Mythri Nagar.Some residents also complain that the smell leaves them with severe headaches and nausea. ""The smell is so strong that we are losing our appetite. Pregnant women and children suffer the most as they are more susceptible to infections and disease. Most of them have constant headaches. We request the authorities to take action before it gets worse,"" said Sainath Yadav, a resident of Gandhi Nagar.However, the Telangana State Pollution Control Board officials said that the problem occurs mostly during winters and can be intense between 8 pm to 9 pm or during midnight when the production in the industries at its peak.""Though these industries release the discharge throughout the year due to cold weather conditions in winters, the emission does not dissipate as quickly as in other weather conditions and spread out with the air into different areas,"" said R Raveender Reddy, Joint Chief Environmental Engineer of the TSPCB.""We will send a team to identify the areas in these areas and take measured to rectify the problem,"" he added.

Quality of air in city remains 'very poor',"PATNA: Residents of the city continue to breathe 'very poor' air as the air quality index (AQI) of Patna was measured at 386 on Tuesday.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), 'very poor' air quality leads to respiratory illness among people after prolonged exposure in the polluted air.Patna was among 11 cities in the country where air quality was recorded under 'very poor' category on Tuesday. Some other cities on the list were Agra, Gurugram, Kolkata, Kanpur, Lucknow and Varanasi. Air quality in Muzaffarpur Gaya and Muzaffarpur was under 'very poor' and 'poor' categories, respectively. /While AQI at Muzaffarpur was measured at 395, it stood at 296 at Gaya. Patna was jointly ranked with Agra as the second most polluted city in the country on Sunday (December 9).The AQI is an assessment of the air quality taking into account eight pollutants, PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns), PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 microns), nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, ammonia and lead.The AQI score between 0 and 100 is considered 'good', 101 and 200 'satisfactory', 201 and 300 'poor' and 301 and 400 'very poor'. The score above 400 is categorized as 'severe' that affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases.According to experts, vehicular emissions, open burning of waste and road dust are the three major contributors to air pollution in Patna. Household emissions stemming from the use of fossil fuel based cooking stoves also contribute to the deteriorating air quality.S N Jaiswal, a senior scientist at Bihar State Pollution Control Board, said, ""The air quality will continue to deteriorate in the winter season as pollutants remain trapped on the surface due to drop in temperature and increase in humidity. The cold winds are heavier, which make favourable conditions for pollutants to trap in the lower level of atmosphere."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
It's not just Delhi that breathes polluted air,"MUMBAI: Winter in the country's financial capital is mild, unlike the frigid conditions in the nation's political battlefield-Delhi. But worryingly, what unites India's two biggest cities-or for that matter, all its towns and even villages-is an intensification of air pollution as the atmosphere cools around this time of the year. Thus, while the focus continues to be on Delhi's perennially poor air quality, winter pollution levels in Mumbai and other parts of India are a cause for concern as well. Track the pollution level live in your cityA look at real-time visualization of pollution levels the world over, courtesy the organization AirVisual, shows how almost all of the Indian subcontinent suffers from high concentration of PM2.5, a harmful pollutant. /The other regions with similar PM2.5 levels include the Arabian peninsula, eastern China and, significantly, the Saharan countries (see graphic).Several factors contribute to the phenomenon-including arid, desert-like conditions, deforestation, crop burning, extensive use of solid fuels for cooking and emissions-almost all of which are typical to the developing world.In 2013, the WHO classified outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic. Sumi Mehta, senior epidemiologist for the environmental health program of the US-based Vital Strategies, says, ""Air pollution kills over 1 lakh children in India every year: 60,000 of them under the age of five. This is not surprising since exposure begins in the womb. In addition, demographic changes are underway, with an increasing aging population and corresponding increase in non-communicable diseases."" Unless measures are taken to arrest air pollution, he says the elderly will bear the lion's share of health impacts in terms of both respiratory and cardiovascular disease.Such measures are necessary given that India's overall pollution figures are extremely high because of regional factors as well (like dusty terrain). ""In some villages, with almost no industrial or urban-like activity, PM2.5 concentrations could be 20-60ug/m3 (microgram per cubic metre). The safe standard in some European countries is as low as 15ug/m3, which is unachievable for most of India due to geography,"" says Rakesh Kumar, director, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI). ""Only in parts of south India, like Bangalore, where we see frequent rains, do we find it possible to meet WHO standards, provided emissions are kept in check.""Thus, keeping local conditions in view, experts have called for a focus on air pollution prevention instead of cure. ""Air quality (especially in the cities) has deteriorated to a great extent and it's absolutely urgent that the public and the government act together to change the way we live,"" says Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner, Greenpeace India. ""Any technology-be it community-scale air purifiers or smog guns or even cloud-seeding-is not a solution to pollution. The only real solution is reducing emissions at source.""Dahiya says people will have to change the way they commute by switching from highly-polluting private motorised transport to public transport and non-motorised transport. ""We will also have to change our consumption patterns, and lower the quantity of the waste we generate. We should just not allow waste disposal by means of burning, which is ruinous for the atmosphere. We will also have to change our energy sources, by switching from polluting coal-based grids to localised solutions such as rooftop solar panels."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Order goes up in smoke, oil firms fined Rs 1cr each","New Delhi: The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has asked Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and Indian Oil to pay Rs 1 crore each as environmental compensation for not ensuring installation of vapour recovery systems at its petrol pumps in compliance with National Green Tribunal order.Such systems capture displaced vapours from a vehicle's fuel tank when petrol or diesel is pumped into it.In similar letters written to the respective chairpersons of all the three companies, CPCB chairman SPS Parihar said random checks of petrol pumps across Delhi (BP 6, IOC 6 and HP 5) revealed that ""Stage-I vapour recovery systems were not installed at inspected retail outlets"".In September this year, NGT had directed public sector oil companies to install the devices at all fuel stations by October 31.The bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel had said the installation was necessary in view of the adverse effects of chemicals like benzene, toluene and ethylbenzene on human health and environment.""There is no dispute about the need for installing the devices at all fuel stations, distribution centres, terminals, railway loading/unloading facilities and airports in Delhi. The only issue is implementation. The matter has been pending for over two years. /The timelines prescribed by CPCB have also expired. There is no justification for the delay,"" the bench, also comprising Justice SP Wangdi, had said.The tribunal had also asked CPCB and the petroleum ministry to issue directions and ensure necessary steps were taken to implement the project.""In respect of petrol pumps selling over 300 KL per month, the directions should be complied with preferably on or before October 31 and with regard to remaining on or before December 31 this year. The tribunal might also consider directing prosecution of the chairman of the oil companies for violation,"" the bench said. It had then directed CPCB to file a compliance report from all the companies by January 15 next year.NGT was hearing a plea by advocate Aditya N Prasad and a Delhi resident Vallari Sheel, who contended that petroleum products at fuel stations contributed significantly to air pollution, and sought directions to stop release of volatile compounds during transfer of petroleum products.The plea referred to a study conducted at various pumps of Delhi which found that the level of toxic fumes containing volatile organic compounds (benzene, toluene and xylene) was several thousand times higher than the permissible limits.""Petroleum products at fuel stations contain traces of benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) all of which are highly toxic. BTX are also potentially toxic air pollutants among other volatile organic compound (VOC), and have been subjected to significant investigations/research in western countries as well as in India,"" the plea said.

Air pollution: SGTPA urges mill owners to shift outside city,"Surat: If all goes well, air and water pollution from city's residential areas housing textile dyeing and printing mills may reduce in the coming years. South Gujarat Textile Processors Association (SGTPA) started convincing textile mill owners to shift their base outside the city.About 65 textile mills are operating in the city's residential areas, including Khatodara, Udhna, Ashwani Kumar Road, Ved Road, Bombay Market and Puna Kumbharia. In these areas, particulate matter (PM10) level is exceedingly high than the national annual average at 184 per micrograms per cubic meter of air (UG/M3) per annum. /Industry sources said state government had asked SGTPA to convince mill owners to shift their factories outside the city. For this, the state government had also proposed to provide land. SGTPA representatives recently held a meeting with the textile mill owners to discuss the issue. SGTPA president Jitendra Vakharia told TOI, ""Textile mills located in GIDCs at Pandesara and Sachin have their own common effluent treatment plants (CETPs). But, the mills located in the city areas directly release their highly hazardous waste either in the creeks or in the river. Also, air pollution is exceedingly high in the city areas. The only option is to shift the mills out of the city. The state government is ready to allot government land on the outskirts of the city limits. About 25 mill owners have shown willingness to shift even as we are trying to convince others."" A SGTPA delegation will be meeting chief minister Vijay Rupani and industries minister Saurabh Patel in Gandhinagar next Tuesday to apprise them about the situation. GPCB officials said apart from vehicular pollution, air pollution from textile mills was mainly responsible for the higher particle pollution in the Diamond City. GPCB vigilance officer Anil Patel told TOI, ""We have made continuous emission monitoring system mandatory for all textile units and they are directly connected to the GPCB. The moment they exceed the prescribed limit, we come to know. In last six months, I have issued notices to 36 textile mills for violating pollution norms. It is always advisable that the textile mills causing air pollution are moved out of the residential zones to safeguard health and lives of the residents."" Many residents staying near textile mills have been suffering from breathing problems, asthma and lung-related diseases. Paresh Ghaswala, a resident of Rustompura, said, ""My wife is suffering from severe asthma for the last 10 years. First she developed breathing problems and later was detected with asthma.

Study on pollution source gets tangled in red tape,"KOLKATA: The source apportionment study on air pollution in Kolkata and Howrah has been delayed due to red tape, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) has said in a reply to an RTI filed by a green action group. The revelation comes at a time when the city is struggling to deal with the worst-ever air pollution with the civic authority and the state doing precious little to address the situation.The study to find out which source contributes how much to the pollution was entrusted to the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) by WBPCB in November 2017. The report is critical to devise a mitigation plan as pollution from different sources have to be prioritised and addressed according to their contribution to the overall pie.The two-year study has, however, been delayed by at least six months due to ""lack of inter-departmental coordination"", the WBPCB has replied to the RTI filed by Legal Initiative For Forest And Environment (LIFE). The RTI had been filed on August 9, 2018. The RTI reply further stated that the emission inventory will be completed by August 2018 and the draft report preparation will be done by December 2018.""For the past month and a half, Kolkata and Howrah AQI is in the range of 250 to 450 (on an average), which interprets the air quality as 'poor', 'very poor' or 'severe' and which could have subsequent health impacts ranging from 'breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure' and 'respiratory illness on prolonged exposure'. It can also affect healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases. /And here we have departments stonewalling attempts by NEERI to get data so that they can prepare a report that can lead to an action plan to reduce pollution,"" said LIFE analyst Kankana Das.The eastern zonal bench of NGT had in August 2016 (order in the matter of Subhas Dutta Vs State of West Bengal and Ors - OA No. 33/2014/EZ) directed WBPCB to initiate a source apportionment study to collect and generate data on contribution of various sources of pollution at important areas in Kolkata and Howrah in order to formulate strategy and to evolve with long-term air quality management plan to combat air pollution.A WBPCB official expressed frustration with the way various government agencies had stalled release of data and at times displayed non-cooperation in aiding the vital study despite repeated requests from the PCB chairman and even the environment secretary.""Kolkata Municipal Corporation was very helpful, but Howrah Municipal Corporation has refused to provide data. Even the WBPCB's persuation failed to make them cooperate. The report on Kolkata will therefore be more accurate while that on Howrah will not,"" the official said.NEERI has till now submitted a one-year progress report on summer 2017 air quality data and analysis.

Admn makes arrangements for homeless people in Patna,"PATNA: The district administration has decided to distribute blankets and light bonfires near several roundabouts in the city from Tuesday night so that people, who spend their nights on streets, can beat the winter chill.Patna district magistrate (DM) Kumar Ravi has asked officials to assess the number of bonfires needed in their respective areas. They have also been directed to distribute blankets to homeless people living on the streets or near bus stops in areas like Gandhi Maidan, Fraser Road, Exhibition Road and Ram Gulam Chowk.""The government's move to help homeless people is an annual practice. Blankets are distributed and bonfires lit when cold wave grips the city,"" the DM told this newspaper, adding there were, however, several permanent night shelters in areas such as Ashok Rajpath near Patna College and Patna Science College and Malahi Pakadi.According to sources, hundreds of people, including rickshaw-pullers, pushcart-owners and deserted people, have to spend their nights in the open due to lack of shelter facilities.Meanwhile, Patnaites gave mixed response to the administration's initiative of lighting bonfires and dry wastes. /Some said it may lead to further rise in air pollution in the city.S K Puri resident Kirtika Kumari pointed out, ""People burn dry leaves, tyres and plastic tubes which emit black smoke in the surrounding areas. This practice should not be allowed.""Sabzibagh resident Shyam Kumar Sharma said, ""The government should expand the number of night shelters that provide free-of-cost accommodation to homeless people, instead of burning wood to provide warmth.""Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) deputy commissioner Vishal Anand said, ""We have set up a temporary shelter at Gandhi Maidan, Kankerbagh auto stand, Uma Cinema and GPO roundabout where people can find accommodation to spend chilly nights"".

How to keep your lungs healthy this winter,"Winter is here and so are the cold breezes. You may not know but cold weather can wreak havoc on our lungs' health. Cold air is often dry and this can spell trouble for many, especially those with chronic lung diseases. /Dry air irritates the breathing tubes and narrows them in people with asthma, COPD and bronchitis. Along with the cold comes flu and that might flare up symptoms of cough, cold and breathing difficulties, especially among the elderly. Cold and flu can also aggravate underlying medical conditions like heart diseases. Air pollution too shoots up during winters and it can put people with asthma at risk.However, with a little care and planning, one can stay healthy and safe during winter. Covering the nose and mouth loosely with a scarf while going out will keep the air we inhale warm. Breathing through the nose instead of the mouth may also be helpful as this will warm the air before it reaches the lungs. One should wear warm clothes, keep feet dry and head covered. When it is very cold and breezy, one should try avoid venturing out.Carrying quick-relief medicines is important for people with asthma and COPD as cold air can tighten the breathing tubes. One should avoid exercising outdoors in extremely cold weather. Have lot of hot drinks and meals regularly as eating regularly keeps the body's energy levels high during winters. Staying active in winters is important as it generates body heat. Chair exercises too are a great way to keep warm.If you catch a cold, watch out for symptoms such as wheezing and breathing difficulty. Visiting a pulmonary specialist before the winter starts is advisable to keep your lungs in good space during winter. Flu can be serious, particularly for people with lung diseases and other medical problems such as diabetes and heart disease. Remember to take flu vaccine every year before the winter starts. If you can, avoid contact with people who have flu symptoms. Wash your hands regularly and cover the mouth and nose with tissue while sneezing or coughing. It is very important to use regular medicines for lung diseases without fail to prevent flare-ups.Contact: Dr Nalini Nagalla MD, senior consultant, Pulmonary and Sleep Disorders, Continental Hospitals; Gachibowli; For details, contact: 040- 6700 0000 For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Panel suggests higher sin tax on tobacco, alcohol","NEW DELHI: The Niti Aayog has proposed a series of tough measures, including higher taxes on tobacco, alcohol and unhealthy foods such as soda and sugar-sweetened beverages, increased public health spending and creation of public health and management cadre in states to revamp the country's public and preventive health system. Underlining the severe shortage of doctors, nurses and paramedics, it also called for major reforms in regulation of medical education and suggested measures to raise the number of doctors, mainly specialists and super-specialists. In its strategy document for New India @75, Niti Aayog primarily deliberated on three areas related to health - Public Health Management and Action, Comprehensive Primary Health Care and Human Resources for Health. /Setting goals for the government to revamp the health care scenario, the document suggested achieving a doctorpopulation ratio of at least 1:1,400 against the WHO norm of 1:1,000 and nurse population ratio of at least 1:500 by 2022-23. It also proposed generating at least 1.5 million jobs in the public health sector by 2022-23, a large number of which will employ women. The Aayog suggested linking 40% district hospitals with medical colleges and creating pathways for training of doctors in specialities and super-specialities at private hospitals to address the shortage of specialists in the country. It suggested similar steps to revamp the regulatory system in nursing, dentistry and pharmacy education. It suggested incentivising state governments to invest in creating a dedicated cadre for public health at the state, district and block levels and including Ayush into the mainstream. Underlining the role of preventable measures, the document said preventable risks such as malnutrition, air pollution and dietary risks were the biggest contributors to disease burden in India. ""Public health action and management is a scientific and professional endeavour which should not be left to untrained employees relying on common sense alone,"" it said.

Pan-India clean air programme set to roll out with Rs 300 crore initial support and a mid-term target,"NEW DELHI: The Centre has earmarked Rs 300 crore for implementation of the upcoming National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) for financial year 2018-19 and 2019-20. Overall cost of taking multiple air pollution abatement measures in 102 cities across the country will, however, be much more than what the government has budgeted for next 15 months. The NCAP is a pan-India national level strategy to tackle increasing air pollution problems in a comprehensive and time-bound manner. The Centre has set a mid-term (five-year) target to reduce air pollution by 20-30% by 2024, taking 2017 as base year. The initial budgeted amount will primarily be meant for expanding air quality monitoring capacities in states, and setting up national emission inventory and conducting source apportionment studies in cities which are important to identify nationwide pollution hotspots, figuring out exact sources of pollution and conduct its own scientific studies on health effects of air pollution.""The NCAP has been finalised after consulting experts and stakeholders. /It will soon be formally announced by the environment minister Harsh Vardhan,"" said an official, adding the ministry has already shared its key points with Parliament during the ongoing winter session.The official noted that the announcement would just be a formality as the NCAP as a strategy document doesn't need to get notified.""States have already been sensitised and asked to submit their city-specific actions plans. Many states including Maharashtra have, in fact, submitted their plans which are being scrutinised by a CPCB expert committee,"" he said.Similarly, source apportionment (identification of emission sources and assessment of extent of contribution of these sources on ambient environment) studies have already been initiated in six major cities - Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Pune and Kanpur. These studies are mainly concentrating on hazardous particulate matters (PM10 and PM2.5). Asked about allocation of merely Rs 300 crore for such a gigantic task, the official said, ""We should not overlook multiple measures, worth thousands of crores of rupees, which are being taken in different sectors (transport, highways, forests and renewable among others) across the country to cut carbon footprints. All these measures will, after all, help in reducing air pollution in those 102 cities and elsewhere.""The NCAP will have an institutional framework, comprising of enforcement mechanism, to look after its implementation and monitoring with taking states and pollution control boards into the loop. There will be an apex committee (under Union environment minister), steering committee (under Union environment secretary) and nationalstate-level project implementation units comprising of officials and scientists from centralstate pollution control boards for implementation of the Programme.Tackling pollution from various sources (power plants, transport, industry, residential and agriculture sectors), increasing number of manual air quality monitoring stations across the country, expanding network of the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) and setting up of Air Information Centre for data analysis, interpretation and dissemination through GIS platforms are among the key components of the NCAP.Setting up Air Information Centre for data analysis and technical assessment cell will help the country in having its own scientific studies on health effects of air pollution. Though India had never denied serious health implications of air pollution, it preferred not to endorse international studies including those from the World Health Organisation (WHO).Referring to latest estimates of the WHO which linked huge number of deaths of children in India to air pollution, the minister of state for environment Mahesh Sharma in his response to a Parliament Question last week said, ""These estimates are, however, based on models, simulations and extrapolations. ""Though air pollution is one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and associated diseases, there are no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation of death/disease exclusively due to air pollution.""Sharma, in his written response, further said, ""Health effects of air pollution are synergistic manifestation of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity etc. of individuals.""

'Air pollution in India is now a public health emergency',"CHENNAI: Every disease is now aggravated by air pollution, says Kalpana Balakrishnan, director of WHO Collaborating Center for Occupational and Environmental Health in an interview. Excerpts: The ICMR study you led shows one in eight deaths in India can be attributed to air pollution. Did you expect this?/ Air pollution has been on the rise but this time we have quantified the impact of air pollution - the morbidity and mortality it causes. And we can say that air pollution in India is now a public health emergency. What in your opinion should be first priority of the state? You would be surprised that the single largest source for ambient air pollution in India is the residential use of solid cooking fuels like wood or coal. They contribute to nearly 24% of the total fine particulate matter pollution. People in a city like Chennai may not use solid fuel much, but if people in rural districts use it, air in cities will continue to be impacted. So it is important not to leave clean cooking fuel out of the air pollution discourse. Organizations like the WHO have now declared clean cooking fuel a priority. Do you think we have been chasing wrong issues like vehicular emissions? No. Vehicular pollution contributes about 2% of total pollution in the country. In our study, we divided the country into 10x10km grids to understand local problems. In New Delhi, the major source of pollution was ambient (outdoor) pollution and not household pollution. Vehicular emission is one of the biggest causes for concern there. In states like Maharashtra, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, where both ambient and household pollution levels are high they may have to device a different policy. Why do you think the policy failed to make an impact? While it is important to know sources of pollution and act on them, we also have to evaluate its effectiveness periodically. Such monitoring is key not only to enthuse policy makers but also encourage people to bring in behavioural changes. If people realize that through their small changes they were making a big impact to the community it would be a great encouragement. Why did you added diabetes to the list of chronic diseases caused by air pollution? Increasingly, scientific studies are pointing at a significant link between diabetes and air pollution. We are discovering that pollution is impacting virtually every disease condition. The individual risk of course is higher for smoking but for a community, air pollution from all sources is a bigger burden. We also estimated that the average life expectancy would have been 1.7 years higher if the air pollution level had been at the level of the existing Indian National Standard.

Chandigarh air quality still poor,"CHANDIGARH: The city continues to record poor air quality index (AQI) in the winter, indicating that the pollution level is not improving. Sector 50 recorded 123 micrograms per cubic metre and Industrial Area very poor AQI of 326 on Monday. Sector 17 had 247 and Sector 39 registered AQI of 302 on December 19. A good AQI should be between 0-100, while 100-200 is termed poor, 200-300 very poor and 300-400 severe. /T C Nautiyal, member secretary, Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC), told TOI, ""Air pollution is going to stay throughout the winter when temperature remains low and air pressure becomes high owing to which the velocity of wind slows down and polluted particles do not disperse and remain suspended in the air. These atmospheric pollutants also intensify the fog and cause smog in the season, leading to poor visibility.""However, pollution is an all-year phenomenon. In June this year, Kaimbwala recorded highest-ever AQI of 858. According to State Transport Authority, the city has the highest density of vehicles in India with 12 lakh two-four wheelers registered , the load of vehicles from the adjoining cities too add to the woe. Mohali industries add to city pollutionStill, the vehicle emission contribute only 35-40% of pollution. Nautiyal explained, ""Big vehicles, such as heavily loaded buses and diesel trucks, cause a lot of emission besides those from cars and bikes. Despite multiplication of vehicles over the years, the pollution level still has not crossed that of NCR. This is mainly due to good quality fuel. Thanks to the Supreme Court, which has ruled that Bharat Stage Emission Standards (BS) IV vehicles will not be sold after March 31, 2020, countrywide, when BS VI norms for cleaner fuel will be executed. This regulation will help Chandigarh in further reducing air pollution.""Construction activity and exposed construction material on road, poor road condition which lead to traffic snarls and more fuel emission and, potholes which make vehicles to scatter dust are equally responsible,"" Nautiyal said.Chandigarh which has very few polluting industries gets affected from grossly polluting industries in Mohali. The pollution causes chronic respiratory disease, allergies, lung complication and chronic obstruction pulmonary disorder (COPD).""The WHO estimates air pollution to be the world's largest single environmental health peril that caused deaths of seven million people in 2012. One in eight of total global deaths due to exposure to polluted air result into more than one third of the premature mortality among pregnant women, children, and adolescents,"" said a COPD specialist.In their newly prepared report on Air Pollution Action Plan, CPCC has recommended to prohibit 15-year-old diesel vehicles on road and recommended induction of electrical buses. Chandigarh Transport Undertaking has already got approval from ministry of urban development to induct electrical buses. In first phase, 20 buses will be added to the existing fleet.
