ToxiCity: Gurgaon air more foul than Delhi,"The air you breathed in Gurgaon on Thursday was the foulest in the country as an overcast sky and absence of strong winds ensured thick smog continued to hang over the city./Gurgaon's AQI was at a 'severe' 454, higher than Delhi (432) and Faridabad (427), which were the country's three most polluted cities on Thursday, data released by the Central Pollution Control Board on Thursday showed. Another set of data released by Safar, though, showed Delhi's AQI on Thursday at 500+. Safar, however, does not measure Gurgaon data./The average concentration of fine particulate matter -PM2.5 -was 697 micrograms per cubic metre (gm3), almost a 70% rise from Wednesday's level of 423. It was also nearly 12 times above the national safe standard of 60 gm3. The peak pollution level, meanwhile, which was recorded at 803 gm3 on Wednesday, breached the 900 mark on Thursday to touch a scary 927 gm3./The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) blamed the high pollution levels on the city's proximity to Delhi but neither the board nor the state government issued a health advisory to people or give any instruction on shutting down schools and polluting industries./""My eyes started burning the moment I stepped out of my house,"" said a woman wearing a mask who got off an auto to board the Metro at Huda City Centre on Thursday. ""I've been having a constant irritation in my throat as well over the past few days, probably because of pollution,"" she added./Experts said the alarmingly high levels of PM 2.5 posed serious health risks and it was strange that the government hadn't reacted. ""Major damage is caused by fine particulate matter because they go straight to the lungs and can cause hazardous diseases,"" said Pankaj Jha, former environmental sciences professor at Delhi University./The weatherman predicted the situation would remain the same unless it rains or the wind speed increases. ""Right now, the wind speed is zero.The situation is expected to improve Monday onwards,"" said a Met department official./4 Gurgaon schools declare holidays; Noida acts too/Rising air pollution has forced private schools to shut down till the air quality index gets better. Four schools--The Heritage School, Shiv Nadar School, The Shri Ram School in Moulsari, and The Shri Ram School in Aravali - have asked students to stay at home till further notice./According to The Heritage School officials, the institution will remain closed from November 4 till school management takes stock of pollution levels on Monday./""We have declared holidays from November 4 in response to rising pollution levels in the city. Unless we collectively take action, the city is going to sink deeper into this crisis,"" said Kaye Jacob, principal, The Heritage School./The Shri Ram schools in Moulsari and Aravali will be closed from Friday. Many other schools have decided to take pro-active steps./Many schools in Noida, including The Shriram Millennium School, has changed their timings and restricted outdoor activities for children. The move came after parents complained about the rising pollution levels in the city./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Breathless in smoke house Delhi as grey shroud triggers health issues,"NEW DELHI: Delhi got an apocalyptic vision on Saturday of what its future could be like if pollution controlling measures are not implemented urgently and aggressively. The city experienced a very alarming air pollution episode as pollution levels shot off the charts.A grey shroud enveloped the city through the day and evening with people complaining of irritable eyes, inflammation of throat and nose and a feeling of running out of fresh air - some even within their homes.The 24-hour air quality index (AQI) was at ""severe"" with an index value of 485, worst for the season and higher than the post-Diwali AQI of 445. Meteorology officials described the phenomenon as ""smoke haze"" and not ""smog."" So did the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) officials. That, however, was little consolation to Delhiites.The day passed without the Delhi government or the Centre announcing any emergency measures though the two remained engaged with the issue. /The lieutenant governor called a high- level meeting to discuss the situation with the chief minister and the ministers of the departments concerned.Experts shocked, urge all to cut down emissionsDelhi has recorded a ""severe"" AQI with just two ""very poor"" days in between since Diwali on October 30. On Saturday, Anand Vihar's AQI remained 500 constantly for several hours, possibly because an AQI above 500 is not even charted. Any concentration above 250 micrograms per cubic metres is graded as ""severe"" whereas concentrations at most locations monitored by DPCC and CPCB remained above 500 micrograms per cubic metres all through the day, shooting up to 700 to 850 micrograms per cubic metres often.""I have lived in Delhi since 1991 and never seen anything like this before. This is of a different proportion altogether,"" said an environment department scientist. Pollution monitoring agencies too were baffled by the particulate matter (PM) levels. ""I advise people to reduce emissions from sources they can control, like vehicles, traffic congestion, waste burning, and construction dust. This can deteriorate further if we keeping adding emissions,"" warned Dipankar Saha, in charge of CPCB's air lab.Ravinder Vishan, scientist in-charge at the Regional Meteorological Centre, said this condition was best described as smoke or dust haze. ""Till 9.30 am there was fog but after that it turned into smoke haze because the relative humidity was below 75%. Pollutants have accumulated because there is no dispersion. The wind speed was between nil and 3 knots or 2 metres per second.""If the relative humidity was higher than 75%, it could have been called smog. ""The mixing height is zero -- even sunlight was not piercing through -- and there is neither vertical, nor horizontal movement of air. This combination is very unusual. I have not seen anything like this in this season before,"" added Saha. The lowest visibility recorded at Safdarjung was 400 metres, far higher than a visibility of 50 metres recorded on November 2 but it seemed hazy because of concentrated particles, said experts.Professor Manju Mohan, atmospheric scientist at IIT Delhi, said: ""I am shocked to see this condition. It is haze but Delhi never had such poor conditions. I even saw brown fumes in some areas. Firstly, meteorological conditions are bad but meteorology will change in Delhi. Local emissions will have to be curtailed. Slow traffic adds to this. Of course, there is excessive crop stubble burning.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Respiratory infection cases shoot up in Agra after Diwali,"AGRA: In the days following Diwali, the city has been witnessing an exponential rise in the numbers of patients suffering from chest infection, asthma and tuberculosis turning up at city hospitals. According to doctors, there has been an increase of 40-45% in the number of such cases in the past five days, compared to normal days./The rise in the number of cases has been registered at SN Medical College (SNMC) and the district hospital here. While SNMC noted a rise of nearly 50%, district hospital officials found a rise of 10-20% so far./Medical experts have attributed the problem to firecrackers burst during Diwali and the smog that enveloped NCR in the days following the festival. Experts suggested that to avoid air pollution-related infections, city residents should avoid direct exposure to the outdoors for long period and use good quality respiratory masks or handkerchiefs./“TB, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cases have gone up in the past five days due to increase in air pollution level in the city,” said Dr Santosh Kumar, head of the TB ward at SNMC./“There has been a 70-80% rise in the number of TB patients being registered at the ward here, which is an enormous rise in comparison to normal days,” Kumar added, but said that as the days pass, the rise in number of cases will decline./The specialist suggested that citizens should avoid direct exposure to the outdoors for long hours and avoid morning and evening walks, as pollution levels are highest during the morning and evening because of thermal inversion and smog formation./“Do not carry out strenuous exercises in the open or non-treated exercise areas like gyms and ask your children not to play outdoors or limit their sports activities to the indoors,” Kumar suggested, adding that people eat jiggery to detoxify and also increase intake of citrus fruits./Dr Gajendra Vikram Singh, assistant professor at the department of TB and chest at SNMC, said that due to smog coming from Delhi NCR, chest and bronchial complaints had increased./“Fever, cough and chest infections are common symptoms due to increased air pollution in the city,” he said, adding that the presence of fine particles 2-5 microns in size has aggravated the situation, particularly among those who have asthma, COPD or TB./He also suggested that fine particles were the product of crop burning by farmers around NCR./“Farmers must stop burning crop residue and find another way of disposing it, as the practice is very harmful to the environment and public health,” Singh added./Dr Suvir Gupta, senior city-based cardiologist said that after Diwali the risk of heart-related disease had also gone up, mainly due to consumption of oily foods and sweets as well as changes in sleeping patterns./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Do the people have the right to breathe fresh air? Centre reprimands Kejriwal government,"NEW DELHI: With the air in NCR rendered unbreathable, the Centre on Friday stepped into action, directing five states “to take immediate measures to control air pollution”./The environment ministry on Friday called a meeting of environment ministers of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab, asking them to immediately act against crop burning, close down polluting brick kilns, check fly ash from thermal plants and address the road dust problem effectively./Conceding that the 42-point action plan announced last year was not adequately enforced, the Centre asked the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to hold monthly reviews on action being taken to check air pollution. The environment ministry will step in to review it every quarter./The National Green Tribunal, meanwhile, on Friday slammed the Delhi government for its lacklustre response towards tackling air pollution. “Have you done anything to prevent children from going to school, did you give advisory to public?” the tribunal observed./“The people have the right to breathe fresh air,” it said while reprimanding the Kejriwal government./The tribunal also summoned the environment secretaries of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Rajasthan over the increase in pollution in the region and asked them to submit a report on burning of agricultural residues and measures taken to curb pollution by November 8. The environment ministry, meanwhile, has outlined an immediate course of action:/STUBBLE CHECK/One of the key causes of air pollution in Delhi — smoke from crop burning in neighbouring states — still stays unaddressed. Environment ministry sources said there has been considerable crop burning in Punjab from last week of October right through the first week of November, pushing up pollution levels in Delhi-NCR. At the meeting presided over by Environment Minister Anil Dave, Punjab has assured that crop burning will be checked./Governments of Punjab and Haryana have been advised to set up biomass power plants in large numbers and it was agreed at the meeting that states should ask major industries to use CSR funds to control stubble burning and procure farm machinery like happy seeders, rotavators, straw choppers etc./Environmental clearance could also be linked to commitments towards utilising CSR funds to control stubble burning./The Delhi government was also asked on Friday to examine the possibility of providing funds from the Environment Compensation Charge and diesel cess to the neighbouring states for incentivising various machinery like happy seeders, rotavators, straw choppers, gyro rakes, bailers, mulchers etc to minimise straw burning by farmers./NO SMOKING/CPCB will develop an app immediately to report burning of garbage/biomass/dry leaves, including landfill fire. All state agencies and enforcement officers will be linked to the app./The Delhi government has been asked to take a slew of decisions with immediate effect. The Kejriwal government will soon write to the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) to ensure that transportation of fly ash around Delhi — mainly from the Badarpur Thermal plant — is done in an environment-friendly manner./There will also be a review of the pollution under control (PUC) checkpoints in Delhi to check vehicular pollution and the traffic police will be asked to ensure lane discipline, check against overloaded vehicles, visibly polluting vehicles and vehicles parked in nondesignated areas./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
That choking feeling when you step out,"Noida/Ghaziabad: It was difficult to breathe outdoors in Ghaziabad and Noida on Saturday as the smoke-haze triggered by crop burning in Punjab and Haryana drove up pollution levels in the NCR cities to a choking high. ""My eyes burnt the moment I stepped out. I tried walking across quickly to a nearby mall but began breathing heavily because of the smog,"" said a 34-year-old woman, a communications professional, standing outside Jaipuria Mall in Indirapuram. /""This is the worst I have felt since this phase began the day after Diwali,"" she added. The particulate matter (PM) 2.5 index in Noida remained in the 'severe' range, at an offscale 500+, during the day, according to data from Safar (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research). In Anand Vihar on the Ghaziabad border, the US embassy's monitoring station showed the PM 2.5 level at an extreme high of 999 microgram per cubic metre. That explained the choking feeling throughout the day in neighbouring Vaishali, Indirapuram and Kaushambi.Many morning walkers and office-goers were seen wearing masks even as the smog and dust created breathing problems for others. ""What we are inhaling these days is nothing but toxic air. We are not safe either in our house or in the car,"" said Rajiv Tandon, who lives in Sector 49, Noida. ""This can be gauged from the recurring cold many residents are having these days. I have breathing problems and a burning sensation in my eyes for the past few days, especially since Diwali,"" he added. District magistrate N P Singh told TOI though there's no advisory for schools to remain shut, they have been asked to stop all outdoor activities given the poor air quality in the city. ""The reason for not closing schools also comes from the fact that many working parents don't have an option to leave the child behind. This is the feedback received from schools and principals,"" said Singh. Ghaziabad DM Nidhi Kesharwani too said that there was no advisory to shut schools.D K Maurya, president of the Federation of Apartment Owners Association in Ghaziabad, added, ""There was a severe burning sensation in the eye when we moved outdoors. Housing societies have advised elderly residents and kids to remain indoors as much as possible."" The Noida RWA federation, meanwhile, wrote to the CEO and DCEO of the Noida Authority over increasing pollution levels. ""The dust is mostly due to various construction work such as Metro, elevated roads, underpasses, U-turns as well as builder construction sites,"" said N P Singh, president, Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations. The RWA body has also demanded that all construction sites be watered on a regular basis to curb dust pollution.According to senior residents, the situation has become worse due to lack of planning. ""Noida has been converted from a farming sprawl to a concrete jungle over the years. As a result, one sees the absence of vegetation on roadsides, considered essential to control dust as well as harvest rainwater,"" said Anil Kumar, an early settler of Sector 56.Noida-based environmentalist Deepak Jain said unchecked construction wasn't helping air pollution, though farm fires were the trigger for the current spell of haze. ""Most green belts are encroached, unkempt or concretised,"" said Jain./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Delhi turns into 'gas chamber', CM seeks Centre's help","New Delhi: Expressing serious concern over the alarming pollution levels in the city, chief minister Arvind Kerjriwal on Saturday sought the Centre's urgent intervention to stop crop stubble burning in neighbouring states. He also appealed to people to minimise the use of private vehicles and switch to public transport. Kejriwal, who compared Delhi's situation to that of a ""gas chamber"", met Union environment minister Anil Madahv Dave and sought the Centre's intervention to deal with the challenge. /Dave has called a meeting of environment ministers of all neighbouring states on Monday and will request them to curb stubble burning in their states. ""There is an emergency situation in Delhi. The situation is bad, particularly for children, patients, women and the elderly. We need to take immediate steps to deal with the situation,"" Dave told reporters, adding he was also exploring the possibility to call a meeting of chief ministers of all these states on the issue.LG Najeeb Jung has also called a high-level meeting on Monday to take stock of the immediate, short-term and long term measures. Those invited to the meeting include the CM, health minister Satyendar Jain, environment minister Imran Hussain, the Delhi chief secretary as well as representatives of the police and the civic bodies.Dave said the situation had been ""very alarming"" and that there was a need to take short-term measures to deal with the situation immediately, adding he discussed with Kejriwal some ""emergency measures"", including ways to contain dust pollution and crop burning.""There are five reasons triggering air pollution that include use of firewood, coal, diesel, petrol and burning of agricultural waste. We have to find a solution to the problem We should imbibe self discipline in our routine lifestyle. If I don't minimise use of my four cars and expect other people to use cycles, that should not be happen. We should collectively come under self-regulation,"" he said.Both Dave and Kejriwal were in agreement that shutting down schools was not the solution. Kejriwal pitched for providing alternatives and incentives to farmers so that they discard the traditional practice of burning farm stubbles. ""There is no one particular reason behind alarming air pollution in Delhi. We need to collectively address all issues and improve air quality. We should not indulge in political blame game,"" Dave added.Earlier at a press conference at his residence, Kejriwal said that pollution had increased to an extent that outdoors in Delhi were resembling a gas chamber. ""Prima facie the biggest reason seems to be burning of stubble in agricultural fields in Haryana and Punjab in huge quantity,"" he said. The CM added vehicle restriction measures like the odd-even scheme would not be able to bring down the smog as initial studies suggest that the influx of pollutant-laden smoke from Punjab and Haryana had aggravated the situation. ""The Centre can sit with the CMs of these states and chalk out a solution. A few reports have put the volume of stubble being burned at 6-20 million tonnes. Fireworks during Diwali marginally added to the pollution./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Why we have failed to tackle air pollution: 5 reasons,"NEW DELHI: Neither the Centre nor the states have put in place a plan to tackle rising pollution in cities across India. Here are five reasons why we have failed to tackle the pollution menace.1. We are not monitoring air quality in real time: 573 places still monitor air quality manually The Central Pollution Control Board gets real-time air quality data from only two or three monitoring stations in most cities. This gives a skewed picture of air quality status and compromises policy-making. /Most cities depend on manual monitoring stations, which use obsolete technology, and data is released just twice a week.2. We don't know the sources of air pollution: 2008 was when data on pollution sources was last collected in citiesA study by IIT Kanpur for Delhi revealed that the contribution of each source of pollution-vehicles, waste burning, construction dust-changes with the seasons, but most cities don't have this information. Bengaluru's emissions inventory was conducted in 2010 and Chennai's by IIT Madras in 2011, while Kanpur, Mumbai and Pune released their reports in 2010.3. Governments fail to enforce: 94 cities don't meet national air quality standards, says CPCBBut no city administration seems worried about getting off that list. Delhi, for instance, is still short of 5,000 buses; it hasn't implemented SC directions on prohibiting waste burning or ensuring construction projects don't pollute. Data for most cities makes it obvious that air pollution is not high on any government's priority list.4. Ignoring health risks: 8.5% of GDP - Welfare costs and lost labour income due to air pollution in 2013 as per World Bank reportWhile air pollution is hurting the country's exchequer, it's also associated with certain cancers, lower birth weight, premature birth, strokes and respiratory disease. Across the country, air pollution is linked to 6.7 lakh premature deaths.5: People aren't pitching inThe Deonar landfill fire drew attention to Mumbai's waste problem, while Delhi's three landfills are constantly on fire exposing lakhs of people to carcinogenic emissions. This is a common problem in all cities. If people segregated garbage at home, there would be no burning of waste. People can also choose public transport, or pick electric and CNG vehicles./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pollution protesters outline clear strategy to lift haze,"GURUGRAM: Wearing masks on a Saturday morning that looked more like dusk, 300 citizens hit the roads of Gurgaon to protest against general indifference to the causes of pollution and create awareness against waste burning. The protesters said they wanted the government as well as people to take ownership of the cause to clean up the air for themselves as well as the generations to come. Among the protesters were CEOs, housewives, doctors, students and retired government officers, all marching together as a thick smoke-haze threw a grey cloak over the city and the air quality index went back to the 'severe' 400+ level. /Calling their motley group 'People Against Air Pollution', they gathered at Leisure Valley Park at 10am to start the march. ""We are blaming farmers in Haryana and Punjab for burning crop stubble,"" said Sanjay Mehta, a doctor who participated in the protest march. ""But the farmers say when people in cities can burn their waste, why can't they? Waste is also burnt by people like us and if we take the onus, we will be able to tackle at least one dimension of the pollution problem. Instead of passing the buck, the need of the hour is to act on the problem and do something about."" Kapil, a resident of Grand Arch in Sector 58, said it was difficult to breathe and people could not wait for a miracle to happen that would solve the problems overnight. ""The situation has been so bad in the last couple of days that people are increasingly finding it difficult to breathe. We have to wake up to the problem. We have to talk to one another, to those who are in the habit of burning waste in our neighbourhood and educate them,"" he said. Some condominiums in the city are setting up their own compost plants, producing zero garbage, but the practice is not widespread yet. Moreover, the government's own garbage disposal system is in a shambles with the solid waste treatment plant in Bandhwari lying defunct since 2013. The protesters said if garbage burning has to be tackled aggressively, composting should be incentivised by the government. Ram Pal Yadav, who came from Pataudi to join the march, said, ""I read about a protest is to be held in Gurgaon against pollution and decided to take part in it and support the cause.

Air pollution touches alarming level in Rajasthan,"JAIPUR: Sriganganagar, Kota and Bundi districts have the highest density of air pollutants in the state as per the latest satellite data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in Delhi at a meeting with state pollution control boards on Friday.According to Rajasthan Pollution Control Board (RPCB) officials, the burning of crops in Punjab and Sriganganagar district has made the situation alarming in northern Rajasthan. In fact, the air quality has touched to the scale of 'alarming.' This means it's dangerous for those having breathing problems.""The thick layer of smog is likely to continue in the northern districts till the situation turns normal in Delhi and Punjab. /The burning of crops is banned in Rajasthan. There's need to take firm action elsewhere as the smoke spreads to other areas in the state,"" said a RPCB official requesting anonymity.The impact of Punjab is evident on the air quality of Jodhpur which shows 360 on the air quality index (AQI). An AQI of 100 is considered normal.After Diwali, the air quality in Jaipur has registered a pollution level of 235. This is considered 'poor' as per the air quality index and 2.5 times worse than the normal.Officials claimed that in a day or two the situation would be brought under control and Jaipur would have moderate or good air quality.The air quality in Kota and Bundi has gone for a toss due to the smoke emitted by industrial units. In fact, Kota along with Jaipur, Alwar and Jodhpur comes in the top 100 polluted cities in the country. Rising vehicular density has further aggravated the situation in these districts.""We have been raising this issue for long.

"'Smog is killing us, but do we have an option?'","NEW DELHI: Fear and uncertainty hang heavy in the air in Bhalswa JJ colony where Anirudh Kumar Pandey's family is celebrating Chhath. A thick layer of smog has enveloped the locality close to which a mountain of waste keeps catching fire due to methane emissions. The smoke emanating from this 40-acre landfill has left many people with lung disorders and caused other health problems.Everybody in Bhalswa is breathing in tiny particles. /Residents often complain of a burning sensation in their eyes. The smog rarely fades away . Sustained exposure to the smog is not safe, but the devotees hardly have any option.""This is the worst episode of smog in the recent years. The sun is rarely visible in the afternoon,"" said Ram Pyare Singh, another resident. Health minister Satyen dar Jain on Saturday visited the landfill site and said it's one of the major contributors to air pollution in the national capital. ""Inspected Bhalswa dumping site to tackle pollution menace,"" Jain later tweeted.Over three lakh people of this colony will celebrate Chhath. They live close to the site where nearly 2,700 tonnes of garbage being generated from south and the north Delhi areas are dumped on a daily basis.""The festival of Chhath is known for purity of offerings and environment. But this year, it will be celebrated in the dirtiest atmosphere,"" said Jitendra Dubey, founder of a Chhath Puja committee. People from Burari also perform the puja at Bhalswa lake.The waterbody draws people from across NCR. Even some people from Panipat also visit this lake during this time of the year. Thousands of devotees spend the night in tents after offering prayers to the sun-god. A resident said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was a regular visitor during Chhath. Over 100 families of bureaucrats will join the celebrations as well. Dubey said it was in 1988 hen migrants from Bihar when migrants from Bihar first celebrated Chhath in Bhalswa. ""A huge pit existed in the place where the mountain of garbage exists today. The entire atmosphere was pure and people offered prayers with a clean heart. Now, devotees feel uncomfortable while performing puja,"" he added. Gulab Singh Rathore, co uncillor of Mukundpur, claims he pushed hard at a recent standing committee meeting of North Corporation for emergency steps to contain the emission of smoke from the landfill. ""Even an-hour-long exposure to the air leaves your eyes with a burning sensation.

Sale of air purifiers and masks soars as Delhi-NCR suffocate,"GHAZIABAD: In the wake of Delhi-NCR region reeling under record breaking pollution levels, the sale of air purifying equipment such as air purifiers and N-95 masks has escalated manifold during last three days in Indirapuram. The demand of air purifiers is soaring at an all time high in the market and their immediate availability is out of stock. ""The demand for air purifiers has increased in the last three days especially in the last two days. We have sold more than 15 pieces today itself and almost a dozen of them have been booked in advance as well,"" said Dheeraj, a salesman. /The demand for purifiers has increased more particularly due to smaller kids and senior citizens, who are the worst hit in this air pollution crisis. ""I am buying this purifier for sake of my mother who is 60 years old. She has been complaining of respiratory problems for the last two-three days and has been coughing a lot,"" said P Verma, customer and resident of Ashiana Upavan, Indirapuram, who was browsing at an electronic store. ""I have two kids, who are 10 and 6 years old. I live on 13th floor and the effect of smog has been bothering my family for long. I had bought this air purifier yesterday itself,"" said another customer. The air purifiers are priced between Rs 9,000 and Rs 50,000, where the price range increases with the increase in surface area of the house. ""The smallest purifier is priced at Rs 9,000 for 200 sqft in Philips and Moonbow and the range increases to Rs 50,000 as well for Rs 1,000 sqft for Philips and Moonbow,"" added a salesman. ""I was in an urgent need so I thought of coming to a retail store like CROMA, otherwise the sale of these purifiers is also strong online and will cost 10 percent less as well,"" said a customer. A basic air purifier consists of a three layer filteration system; the first filter is the 'Pre filter' which cleanses the solid, slightly large impure particles from the environment like hair, larger dust particles, small insects etc., the second filter is called a 'Carbon filter' which absorbs the harmful and toxic fumes, cigarette smoke, foul smell among more and the final step of filtration is called 'Hapa filter', which cleanses the air of any bacteria and viruses.

Every year, pollution peaks after the festival, though the worst months are December and January . The administration has been taking sporadic steps to check pollution. For instance, use of adulterated fuel by autorickshaws, a major source of pollution, was banned. Automatic pollution recording stations have been set up, but monitoring and implementation of norms remain lax.Automatic recording stations often do not work. The three major causes of pollution are vehicle emission, construction dust and industrial emission. Over the last five years, a number of industrial units have been forced to move out of Kolkata or adopt less-polluting methods. Many have switched from coal to LPG. Pollution from construction dust remains a threat since Kolkata is expanding fast and construction activity is on the rise. --Prithvijit Mitra/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

For the past couple of years when air pollution in Delhi, Kanpur, Lucknow and Varanasi touched dangerous levels, the CPCB did nothing to ensure that its directions on meeting air quality standards were enforced. /Lucknowites had a feel of Delhi on Sunday as a sheet of dense smog enveloped the city and air pollution levels rose alarmingly-three to four times of the pollution witnessed on normal days and six to eight times of the permissible limits. The smog, which created a scare among people, is likely to remain till Tuesday .State Met director JP Gupta said the smog was formed by accumulation of pollutants in the air during this part of the year when temperatures are below normal, wind speed is low and moisture content is high. ""The moisture content is high because easterly winds are dominating the atmosphere. The pollutants combine with tiny water droplets to form smog,"" he said. In dry weather, pollutants settle down or are blown away.The easterly winds had also led to clouding on Saturday, which caused drop in maximum and minimum temperatures. People woke up to haze on Sunday and as the day passed, the smog got thicker with addition of pollutants.Monitoring by the Indian Institute of Toxicology and Research (IITR) showed that PM2.5 and PM10 concentration in the air was around 400 micrograms and 800 micrograms respectively between 11am and 3pm, almost on a par with the pollution that made the city gasp on Diwali day.In comparison, Delhi on Sunday recorded PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations around 672 and 864 respectively.The permissible limits as per the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for PM2.5 and and PM10 are 60 and 100 micrograms respectively .

What worked for Beijing might not here,"New Delhi: With public pressure mounting, the Delhi government seemed desperate to find an immediate solution to the severe air pollution problem.

But cloud seeding may not be as simple as it appears. In fact, it may not work at all in the prevalent weather condition in Delhi. /""You need more moisture to do cloud seeding. I think it's an impractical idea because cloud seeding may not be possible in such a large area. The mog may return in a day or two because emissions will continue. Plus, there will be additional emissions from the aircraft used,"" said professor Manju Mohan of Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT Delhi. Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, has a cloud seeding and weather modification programme, and scientists from there have been testing physical problem of aerosol particles all over Delhi. ""Moisture can be a tricky issue in Delhi. The relative humidity should be between 80% and 90%, but that alone is not enough. We need to understand what the pollution particles in Delhi are like. What are their chemical and physical properties? These particles may not be able to form rain drops like clouds do,"" said a scientist. He added that even if pollutants are washed out, relief would be short-term as emission would continue. The nature of pollutants would also determine the environmental impact of rains that wash down these. ""Acid rain is not common any more, but we need to study what are these pollutants,"" he added.The total cost of one such cloud-seeding exercise could range between Rs 10 crore and Rs 12 crore, including the cost of hiring aircraft, radar technology and other instruments. National Green Tribunal on Monday directed the Delhi government to check the possibility of spraying water from helicopters to keep the dust and smoke down. Cloud seeding found no mention. China uses a wide range of technologies and has a budget of nearly $2 trillion to assist what premier Li Keqiang describes as ""war on pollution"".

CPCB scientists said the average wind speed was 0.9 metres per second on Saturday, 0.6 metres on Sunday and 1.1 metres on Monday. The PM average 2.5 concentrations recorded at CPCB stations were 582 micrograms per cubic metres on Saturday which is 9.7 times the national safe standard, 709 micrograms per cubic metres on Sunday, 1.7 times the safe standard, and 423 micrograms per cubic metres on Monday, about seven times the standard.A SAFAR scientist said the wind speed was virtually nil and the wind direction was north-westerly until now but that is changing to north-easterly. ""The boundary layer was as low as 50 metres yesterday. Now it's between 50 and 100 metres.

Diwali pollution created by bursting of excessive crackers in Nehru Nagar can result in serious respiratory diseases even on healthy people and serious health effect on people with lung/heart diseases.""Claiming the situation to be no different from residential areas of smog-hit New Delhi, environmentalist, Subhash C Pandey said, ""Air ambient quality and noise pollution in city areas have crossed all limits according to CPCB, whereas MPPCB is giving false hope to the residents that air quality is improving. How can a government body be so lenient in making such a serious report? They haven't even touched other important residential areas apart from Arera Colony in their report.""Moreover, if we talk about CPCB report, pollution-level in Bhopal on Diwali is extremely high, if they would have included, Hamidia road too in their report, Bhopal would have been among the severely polluted cities,"" he warned.Another residential area, Shahjanabad has recorded 215\xB5g/m3, which places it under under the category of moderate section.While MPPCB report suggests air pollution has come down, the areas mentioned in the report Arera Colony, Hamidia Road and Govindpura are still under category of poorly-affected areas, where the pollution can also cause breathing discomfort to people on prolonged exposure to pollution and discomfort to people with heart diseases, according to CPCB.On Diwali day, due to heavy bursting of crackers, noise pollution level in Bhopal recorded was 104.2 dB and also the average level value observed above the prescribed limit.""Vehicular movement, traffic jam, noisy crackers and playing of high pitch musical instruments during festival are the main sources attributed for the resultant increase in high noise level,"" says the CPCB report.According to P S Bundela, MPPCB, Regional officer, ""The pollution level varies from place to place. We have gathered data from our designated centres as per the guidelines of CPCB. Our report is based on one residential, one commercial and one industrial area.

Paytm chief Vijay Shekhar Sharma flies out of Delhi for fresh air,"NEW DELHI: On Sunday night, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma took the last flight out of Delhi to Mumbai. There was no early morning meeting in Mumbai, but he could not take the haze and smog that has engulfed the national capital anymore. ""I couldn't have waited till Monday. Air is really bad in Delhi and I'm allergic to dust,"" Sharma told ET over the phone from Mumbai. Sharma, who lives in the Greater Kailash area of upscale South Delhi, left with his family and won't be back till the air becomes ""breathable.""/""The met department says by Wednesday this week things will improve. In the past few years, every winter we do have such a situation, but this year has been the worst. I think I'll have to move out of Delhi every year from mid-October,"" said Sharma, who cancelled half-a-dozen appointments and an office employee review meeting this week in Paytm's Noida head office. Before taking off, Sharma sent a mail to Paytm employees, encouraging them to use masks and skip coming to office if they feel so./Sharma said in the mail: ""We are seeing unprecedented air pollution in Delhi-NCR. Our admin team is working to get air purifiers and more plants to avoid pollution and clean air in office. I have also ordered five air purifiers from China for different floors in Noida.""/He added: ""In middle of this, may Isuggest you to choose avoiding going out and keep indoors as much. If you choose, please work from home. You can obviously come to Noida office, but don't forget to use a mask on road. Air quality is expected to get better in next two days. I suggest you to consider working from home seriously for tomorrow at least."" In 2014, Sharma had contemplated shifting to Bengaluru due to the poor air quality in Delhi NCR, but abandoned that plan because of traffic problems and pollen in the hi-tech city's air./Besides, ""other cities are not as well connected to global destinations as Delhi is. So I have to be in Delhi-NCR. I understand this (smog, pollution) is part of the economic growth cycle. But as we grow we have to be conscious of the environmental impact of growth,"" Sharma added. Paytm is distributing masks to employees and has ordered indoor plants that can absorb toxins. A large telecom company, which wished not to be identified, has issued an advisory urging employees to stay indoors and work from home if necessary. It asked employees to avoid morning walks and outdoor exercises, besides encouraging those commuting to work to wear masks and use the air exchange in their cars to remove stale air./Fortis Healthcare is distributing air masks to employees, emailing health tips on the ill effects of air pollution and offering work-from-home option for one week for pregnant women and flexi-time options for all employees. Other multinationals in the Delhi-NCR that ET spoke to including SAP and Microsoft are monitoring the situation. They have been able to cope with the smog and haze as they already have air purifiers and give options to employees to work from home. At Microsoft India, a health and security advisory has been issued asking employees to take precautions and work out of home if needed./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Day curbs may flop as night air worse,"New Delhi: There is considerable variation in day time and night time PM 2.5 levels in the national capital with higher levels between dusk and dawn that reduces the efficacy of measures like odd-even, recent research has shown.Studying the impact of Diwali on air quality, the research carried out at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) showed the effect of the festival was not uniform throughout the day and was more prevalent at a particular time of the day than other times. ""The day of Diwali festival varies in the Gregorian calendar between October 17 and November 15 every year. Existing pollution levels are already high when compared to the annual average. /This is a confounding effect,"" the research by Dhananjay Ghei and Arjun Gupta revealed.An earlier work by the authors showed that there was variation in hourly pollution levels during different days of a week. ""We see that pollution levels are low during the day, but start increasing post 6pm and remain elevated till 9am of the next day,"" the paper said. ""The average PM 2.5 concentration from 6pm to 9am is 140 \xB5g/m3, whereas the average PM 2.5 concentration from 9am to 6pm is 108 \xB5g/m3. PM 2.5 levels in the range of 101-200 can cause breathing discomfort to anyone with prolonged exposure to the air during these times,"" it said. The NIPFP researchers said ""a measure that restricts traffic during the day such as the odd-even policy is unlikely to be as effective as a measure that restricts emissions at night"".The paper said the monsoon months have the lowest levels of PM 2.5 as larger particles settle in a few hours due to gravity, and smaller particles such as PM 2.5 are removed by precipitation. ""Winters have the highest levels of PM 2.5 in the air on account of low wind speed and high relative humidity. PM 2.5 concentration reaches above 200 in winters, which can cause respiratory illnesses to people on prolonged exposure and puts people with respiratory illness and heart disease on a far greater risk,"" it said.Elaborating on the location effect of pollution, the NIPFP research showed that Chanakyapuri seemed to perform better than other areas of Delhi in terms of PM 2.5.""Anand Vihar has the highest pollution levels amongst the five different locations, and has severe levels of air pollution in the night. This can cause respiratory impact even on healthy people, and serious health impacts on people with lung/heart diseases,"" it said.""Thus, we see that there is a strong location effect on pollution levels,"" the research showed./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air quality monitoring stations incapable of covering entire city,"The air quality monitoring equipment installed in five different locations across Nashik by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) are incapable of keeping a check on the entire city. This makes the situation a little worse as according to a recent finding, Nashik - with a population of around 18 lakh - was among the four cities that crossed the air pollution limit.The air quality monitoring stations are installed at Udyog Bhavan (MPCB's regional office), MIDC Satpur, Nashik Municipal Corporation building (East division) in Old Nashik, behind mayor's official residence and in KTHM College.""The air quality monitoring stations can record maximum up to a two-km radius from its installation point. The apparatus at KTHM College campus - Automated Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station - was installed recently under the Smart City project. /The MPCB has outsourced the monitoring work and we have only provided space. It gives data every 15 minutes. The average daily PM limit should be 100 microgram per meter cube but generally, we have it around 80 microgram per meter cube,"" said Dnyaneshwar Khandbahale of KTHM's environment department that monitors air quality.He added that throughout the day readings vary and generally winter mornings show higher reading due to fog. On Tuesday, air quality was 79 microgram per meter cube in the evening, 130 microgram per meter cube on October 28, on October 29 it was 149 microgram per meter cube at 9.45 am and on November 1 it was 146 microgram per meter cube in the morning.Agreeing that the number of air quality monitoring machines is insufficient, Khandbahale said, ""The machines were installed 10-12 years ago and since then the city has grown. There has been development on either side of the river. Hence, more number of machines is needed but this is a policy decision of the MPCB,"" he said.Environmentalist Rajesh Pandit said, ""The state transport buses emit a lot of black smoke and pollute the air. It is doubtful if they even have a PUC (pollution under control) certificate. There are around 7.5 lakh vehicles in the city as on March 31, which also add to the pollution to some extent.""An MPCB officer said that the air monitoring equipment were not sufficient to keep a check on the pollution and they would consider proposing more machines but that the city's air quality was still well under control./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
1.8L diesel vehicles to go off roads,"NEW DELHI: National Green Tribunal's July order to ""deregister"" all diesel vehicles older than 15 years is finally going to be implemented by the Delhi government, with lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung on Monday asking the transport department to act on the ruling immediately. It is likely to affect 1.8 lakh diesel vehicles in the city, said transport officials.The decision was taken after a meeting at Raj Niwas to discuss the crisis in Delhi due to air pollution. Jung directed that instructions be issued to all motor licensing officers (MLOs) to start deregistration of all these diesel vehicles in a phased manner. /According to a press statement issued by the LG's office, ""This will bring about a reduction of 2 lakh diesel vehicles on Delhi's roads."" The transport department and Delhi Police have also been told to immediately stop entry of overloaded trucks and non-destined trucks, particularly those from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. ""In two days, engineers will work out a solution to turn away these trucks from Delhi,"" Jung said. Both authorities have been told to ""robustly"" check pollution-under-control certificates and ""take strictest action against violators"". Smoke meters will also be installed at all border points.The slew of measures come on the heels of similar directions from NGT. The transport department has already stopped re-registration of both petrol and diesel vehicles that are more than 15 years old for several months now. Monday's order will affect 79,803 private diesel vehicles. Out of the 81,169 goods vehicles coming under the order, most are used by local traders. Officials admitted that only strict enforcement of the NGT order could take these vehicles completely off roads. However, an official said many of the small commercial vehicles were still in use despite not being re-registered.The silver lining for many owners is that the order is to be implemented in a phased manner. Vehicles older than 10 years but less than 15 years can get a no-objection certificate from the transport department, enabling the owners to sell or re-register the vehicles outside NCR. However, for the private diesel vehicles older than 15 years, it's a death knell. ""We have already got a year-wise list of vehicles which are between 10 and 15 years,"" said a government official./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Apportionment study to find source of pollution: MPPCB,"BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) will conduct Sources Apportionment Study of five cities to find out source of air pollution.The study will cover pollution from vehicles, construction work, industrial, housing and other activities. The cities to be studied are Bhopal, Indore, Ujjain, Dewas and Sagar. MPPCB officials said these five cities have been identified for carrying out the Sources Apportionment Study due to high pollution levels present there. /The study will help identify reasons behind air pollution and arrive at a conclusion as to which source is causing how much pollution. Based on the findings, the authorities will try to cut down pollution levels. However, the process will take time because experts point that at least three years are required for carrying out the study in one city. Besides, the cost of study is around Rs 1.5 crore per city.Pollution is measured by taking into account level of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. Cause of SO2 is vehicles. Nox is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage among others. RSPM 10 is on account of dust, construction, including building of roads, while PM2.5 is as a result of dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Officials said that of the four, PM2.5 is most harmful for health since it goes inside human body and causes severe lung diseases.PCB officials said respirable dust sampler instrument is used for measuring air pollution. Filter paper and cyclone are used for calculating PM10 (respirable particulate matter) and PM2.5, with the help of which dust particles are measured in the air, while absorbent solution helps measure if sulphur dioxide is present.MPPCB chief chemist Shyamanuj Tiwari said the study, which is primarily based on measurements and tracking down the sources, will help in identifying the sources and the extent of their contribution. ""In MP, it is being initiated by efforts of our member secretary AA Mishra. A workshop has been scheduled in the state capital on Thursday in which field experts will present case studies and their findings on ambient air quality in different cities,"" he said.Officials said air pollution problem becomes complex due to multiplicity and complexity of the sources, which include industries, automobiles, domestic fuel burning, dust on road and construction. A cost-effective approach for improving air quality in polluted areas involves identification of emission sources, assessment of extent of contribution of these sources on ambient environment, prioritising the sources that need to be tackled, evaluating various options for controlling the sources and formulation and implementation of action plans.In MP, air quality is monitored at 37 places, including Ujjain, Bhopal, Indore, Dhar, Gwalior, Jabalpur, Sagar, Satna, Singrauli, Shahdol and Katni. Of these, Bhopal has the maximum six air quality monitoring stations.Ambient air quality of Bhopal, Indore, Ujjain, Dewas and Sagar is moderate or close to moderate, which is just above poor category in ambient air quality index./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
HC raps govts for pollution 'genocide',"NEW DELHI: Failure of the government to reduce air pollution amounts to ""genocide"", the Delhi high court observed on Thursday.""Punjab stubble burning is killing us,"" a bench of Justices B D Ahmed and Ashutosh Kumar said, adding that Delhiites are being robbed of three years of their life due to alarming pollution levels.""It is literally capital punishment as the capital is being punished and that too for no offence. People are being killed in the capital,"" an anguished bench remarked, equating reduction of life span due to government inaction as ""genocide and murder.""""As per a report, life expectancy would be 3.2 years less than what it ought to be. Assuming that population of Delhi is 20 million, it would mean that approximately 60 million life years are being robbed from the people of Delhi,"" the bench said, slamming both central and Delhi governments for being concerned with ""ballot box"" instead of human beings.It pointed out that ""despite repeated directions"" and public opinion, the ""governments responsible have not acted in the manner they should have"" on the menace of deteriorating air quality. /The bench also saw satellite images submitted by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) showing stubble burning in northern India, to underline that level of pollutants in the air peaked in first week of November due to biomass burning in Punjab.""Unfortunately, the state of Punjab is in denial mode and contests allegations that they are responsible for air pollution in Delhi. Punjab has not taken action as have the states of Haryana and Rajasthan, despite our clear warning earlier,"" the bench noted. It warned Punjab's top civil servant, the chief secretary that he will face contempt unless he explains why ""our directions were not carried out and what prevented him from doing so"".It gave the state time till November 18 to reply.As regards landfill sites, the court expressed concern over the ""fires simmering"" there aggravating air pollution and observed that the sole solution is to segregate garbage and use it for generation of power.The directions came on a PIL the court initiated suo moto to monitor cleaning up of Delhi air. On the last date of hearing HC had asked the states of UP, Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana to stop stubble burning to ward off the problem of haze. It referred to Delhi government's proposal to convert the closed-down thermal power plant at Rajghat into a waste to energy plant and said the project, which is estimated to take 18 months from start to finish, should be started at the earliest.On reports submitted by Haryana and Rajasthan, the bench said these states are moving in right direction as there is ""no significant contribution (from stubble burning) from these states to Delhi.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Fall in urban air quality showing on health,"KOCHI: The fall in urban air quality increases the risk of stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma, according to the latest report of the World Health Organisation (WHO).The most vulnerable population affected by these high levels of pollution are children. ""They breathe twice as quickly as adults and take in more air.Their air pipes are more porous and thus more vulnerable,"" said Dr Ramesh Kumar, national president-elect, Environment chapter, Indian Academy of Paediatrics.He said that their immune systems are weaker and hence any bronchial condition developed during the stage will affect them for life.Ultrafine, airborne pollutants present in smoke and fumes can easily enter and irritate children's lungs, causing and exacerbating life-threatening diseases. Studies show these tiny particles can also cross the blood-brain barrier, which is less resistant in children, causing inflammation, damaging brain tissue, and permanently impairing cog nitive development. /""They even can cross the placental barrier, injuring the developing foetus when the mother is exposed to toxic pollutants,"" said the latest UNICEF report on children.""Its not the asthmatic children who are vulnerable. The total quality of life in children with bronchial condition is affected,"" he added. Studies have shown that air pollution is strongly associated with respiratory conditions such as pneumonia, bronchitis and asthma, among others. It can also exacerbate underlying health issues and prevent children from going to school, and there is emerging evidence that it can disrupt physical and cognitive development.Air pollution and cardiovascular diseases have an indirect co-relation, say cardiologists.""Patients who have had cardiac failure, valve failure and congenital heart disease (CHD) suffer the most due to air pollution. Patients who have respiratory problems and breathlessness feel shortage of oxygen. This causes a strain on the heart too. Any pressure on the lungs means the heart has to work more,"" said senior cardiologist Dr Rony Mathew Kadavil./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Sea takes care of city air, no need of filter, says HC","Chennai: Making light of a pollution alarm raised in a PIL petition, which said Chennai's air pollution could get as bad as that of the national capital, the Madras high court said there was no cause for such concern here now as the coastal city enjoyed a great locational advantage.Dismissing the plea filed by a mechanical engineer for installation of electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) at polluted public places so that dust could be filtered and ambient air quality improved, the first bench said: ""The petitioner seeks to plead for electrostatic precipitators, which are stated to be highly efficient filtration devices and used for industrial purposes, to be installed. The cause for action is stated to be the Delhi air quality. We are, however, of the view that we are concerned with Chennai and the state of Tamil Nadu and not with Delhi, which has its own peculiar problems so far as air pollution is concerned. /The position is not so in Chennai on account of its locational advantage, being next to the sea and thus sea breeze is of a great assistance on this count. We cannot thus say that in future this problem will arise merely on the say of the petitioner. At present, there is no cause for concern, as the problem does not exist in Chennai.""In his petition, N Janardhanam of Thirumullaivoyal said Delhi's hazardous air quality had turned the city into a gas chamber, and added that doctors cautioned that suspended particle matter could cause respiratory diseases if one was subjected to prolonged exposure. ""We have to capture the dust and smoke particles from atmosphere to achieve clean India,"" he said, adding, ""there are several types of electrostatic precipitators available. But authorities failed to capture the dust and smoke particles from the atmosphere by installing ESPs in polluted public places.""The petitioner said ESPs were highly efficient filtration devices that would slow down flow of gases through the devise and could easily remove fine particles such as dust and smoke from air, he said a suction pump to pass the polluted air in a moderated speed through this devise had to be provided.

Poor Air Quality Can Cause Pneumonia,"By Shailee Prabhu/The Delhi smog situation has opened our eyes to the serious threat of air pollution to our health. While we can enjoy fresh air in Goa, can the same be said of the indoor air quality? Most of the urban population spends almost 12 hours a day indoors and that too in an AC environment, be it in office or time spent on recreation in theatres and malls or even the time sleeping at home./But have we thought if the air indoor is good enough? Has anyone thought of the effect of this untreated air on our health? On World Pneumonia Day today, there may be some thought spared on the subject./Pneumonia is infection of the lungs caused by bacteria, virus, fungi or parasites in the air we breathe. Bacterial pneumonia is the most prevalent one. An interesting perspective of bacterial pneumonia called the legionnaire disease is being increasingly recognized as a deadly, but preventable illness. The causative bacteria, Legionella Pneumophila, which breeds in cooling towers and drain pans proliferates through the air conditioning systems. These bacteria are disseminated in aerosol and come in contact with susceptible individuals, old people, children, immunologically-compromised individuals and infect them./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
B'luru pollution levels rise as combat measures fall short,"Bengaluru: The worst smog clouding Delhi in 17 years comes as a warning to Bengaluru. While laxity in implementation of guidelines issued by the Union government is being blamed for the alarming levels of air pollution in the national capital, Bengaluru is no less guilty. This, despite reporting 5% annual average increase in Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) levels over the past five years.On December 30 last year, the Union ministry of environment and forests issued 42-point guidelines to combat the menace of polluted air. /Though they primarily focused on the National Capital Region (NCR), the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) called upon states to tackle air pollution with the guidelines as the base. The norms had short-term and long-term measures, including controlling vehicular emissions, vacuum cleaning of roads to prevent dust, control of open burning of biomass such as leaves, industrial pollution and from construction and demolition work. Almost a year on, not much has been seen when it comes to the guidelines in Bengaluru or Karnataka in general. Experts say the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) lacks teeth and its role is limited to issuing notices. Chairman Lakshman says, ""Old vehicles like buses and autos that ply on city roads emit black smoke. While not many users bother to get their vehicles checked for air pollution, the agencies concerned need to act against them.""Suresh R, another expert, said though the guidelines call for ensuring strict action against visibly polluting vehicles and steps to prevent parking in non-designated areas, nothing much has been done. ""To arrest road dust, the guidelines call for deployment of wet/ mechanized vacuum sweeping of roads. However, we see very few mechanized sweepers functioning in the city. And there is a need to maintain pothole-free roads for free flow of traffic, to reduce emission and dust. Sadly, this is not happening properly and rising pollution levels are gradually taking a toll on the lungs, especially of children and senior citizens,"" he explained.Asked what they were doing to tackle air pollution, transport department officials said they have been working hard to detect polluting vehicles. ""We've introduced several measures, like random but continuous enforcement checks, where we fine those without pollution under control certificates, as well as a checking mechanism which allows users to find out if the certificates issued are authentic. We are targeting different areas, depending on the kind of traffic, and stopping vehicles for checks. It isn't easy as we are short-staffed too. But knowing vehicular emission is a big contributor, we are encouraging more such drives. We also regularly audit the centres issuing pollution under control certificates,"" said a transport department official.(With inputs from Aditi Sequeira)/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
New Link Road hits roadblock due to shutdown orders on hot-mix plants,"GHAZIABAD: Commissioning of the second lane of the New Link Road in Ghaziabad has hit a roadblock owing to prohibitory orders imposed by the district administration upon operation of hot-mix plants in the city. One side of the 3.6-km-long road, allowing movement of cars and two-wheelers from NH-58 towards NH-24, had been thrown open to public by Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) on November 1.The other lane of the road, which would allow vehicular movement from NH-24 towards NH-58, was tentatively scheduled for opening on November 5-6 following completion of minor works. The opening date was subsequently postponed to November 15. However, on Tuesday, GDA said that the pending work has been stalled because of a ban imposed in the city on operation of hot-mix plants.""Black-topping work on a certain section of the unopened lane close to NH-24 is yet to be completed. /This work has hit a roadblock because hot mix plants in Ghaziabad have been ordered a shutdown. Work cannot be undertaken on this section because of non-availability of tar. Hot mix plants cannot operate till the time the orders of the district magistrate are in prevalence in Ghaziabad. We are waiting for the orders to be lifted,"" GDA executive engineer, Chakresh Jain, told TOI.The ban on hot mix plants in Ghaziabad had been imposed by the district administration in view of the heavy air pollution that was witnessed in early November. The administration had imposed closure orders upon all construction activities as well as operation of hot mix plants in an order issued on November 7. The order had been issued in order to clamp down upon air pollution caused by smoke from burning activities and dust from construction activities.According to GDA officials, there have been no clear instructions on lifting of the closure orders till Tuesday.

City to get air action plan soon,"Ahmedabad: The state government will give its final touches to a comprehensive air action plan for Ahmedabad city in the coming few days. This will be the second such action plan since 2002. The continuous toxic smoke pumped into our air by the Pirana dump fire, gas leak complaints from the surrounding industrial belt and growing vehicular congestion has been the primary reasons for expediting the action plan.Back in 2002, the Bhure Lal Committee had overseen the implementation of the air action plan for the city which helped roll out of CNG autorickshaws and buses. A lot had changed since then, with pollution levels rising the alarm button has been pressed on rising 2.5-micron particulate matter (PM 2.5), NOx, carbon particles, benzene and ozone levels. /The central pollution control board (CPCB) last year proposed guidelines to 21 states to help them formulate their own air action plans for cities.The action plan will cover aspects like the phasing out of polluting vehicles, adulteration of CNG oils sold on the roadside and better coordination between municipal and police departments in decongestion and ensuring pothole-free roads, which cause jams and lead to concentration of exhaust fumes in local areas. Greening along traffic corridors and major residential areas will gain ground now and new plans, including one for street adoption, will be promoted. Another focus area is automation of the PUC certification system, for which in Delhi a remote sensor-based PUC system was introduced.""PUC standards have not changed for over a decade, even as there is talk of bringing in cleaner Bharat Stage-VI fuel,"" says a senior revenue official. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has already proposed introduction of battery operated vehicles in the congested Walled City.

Dust disease taking its toll on India,"The ""apocalyptic Pollution levels in Delhi"" has been widely reported. The recent ghastly smog has shrouded the national capital for over a week, turning it into a ""gas chamber,"" and showing no sign of dissipating. By 11am, Delhi's air quality index (AQI) was at 724, already far beyond the ""hazardous"" level of 300, according to data from the US embassy's real-time pollution monitoring system. For comparison, the healthy limit is 50. With regards to the condition of our roads, earlier this year, IIT-Kanpur found that 56% of particles below 10 microns was caused by road dust, 10% by industrial points, 10% by concrete batching and only 9% by vehicles. /In the case of PM2.5, the contributions were 38% by road dust, 20% by vehicles, 12% by domestic fuel and 11% by industry. Dust pollution is the main air contaminant and environmental hazard, having extensive health, safety and environmental consequences, and is posing significant risks to everyone and everything. Despite these consequences, it is concerning how little attention is paid to dust management - although recent dust problems have created sharp focus on the issue now.Airborne dust particles can pass through the nasal passage and travel to the deepest regions of the lungs. When anyone breathe in this dust over a prolonged period of time, it can cause a number of respiratory conditions, including breathing difficulties, respiratory pain, diminished lung function and even cancer. However, because these conditions often take several years to develop, both employers and regulators don't take them as seriously as workplace injuries, until now.Recently we have seen a real change in Governments position on the dust problem, especially in Metro's such as Delhi - where the problem is severe.If you see there are other drawback's including wastage of water. Having dust being identified as one of the major contributors to air pollution in Delhi, it is recently on 08th November 2016 the government ordered approximately 25 lakhs little of water sprayed on road to kerb and central verges to settle the dust. In addition to impacting the health of workers, airborne dust can significantly reduce visibility on the road, increasing the risk of vehicle accidents. There are accidents on haulage roads every day in India as a direct result of dust.Global Road Technology, an Australian infrastructure company now based in Pune that specialises in technology for the creation of stabilised roads and environmentally friendly polymer dust binding technologies is calling on Delhi companies to be more proactive about dust management on work sites. Managing dust could be challenging for the mining, power, construction, milling and supporting industries, as dust is inherent to many of industry's essential operations and can be generated from a variety of sources. Global Road Technology specialises in eliminating fugitive dust by applying a patented polymer solution to the surface of roads and paths, that bind soil particles and fugitive dust.This technology eliminates dust immediately, saving client's significant money from their construction and maintenance budgets. It is easy to apply, using a water tanker and spray hose. GRT have been working in communities across the world to deliver this innovative technology, including undertaking a number of projects in Australia, Asia and the Middle East. GRT recently completed a project for the Kumbh Mela to control the dust plumes kicked up by high traffic.

200 million Indians had high BP in 2015: Lancet,"India has recorded a whopping 200 million people suffering from high blood pressure, a key risk factor for heart attack. According to the same study, China reported 226 million people in 2015.The study, published in the journal, The Lancet, analysed changes in blood pressure from nearly 20 million people in every country in the world between 1975 and 2015.""High blood pressure is the leading risk factor for stroke and heart disease, and kills around 7.5 million people worldwide every year. /Most of these deaths are experienced in the developing world,"" said lead author Majid Ezzati, Professor at the Imperial College London.A compilation of 1479 studies has measured the blood pressures of 19\xB71 million adults. The number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1\xB713 billion in 2015, with the increase largely in low-income and middle-income countries. Blood pressure is a multifaceted trait, affected by nutrition, environment, and behaviour throughout the life course, including fetal and early childhood nutrition and growth, adiposity, specific components of diet, especially sodium and potassium intakes, alcohol use, smoking, physical activity, air pollution, lead, noise, psychosocial stress, and the use of blood pressure lowering drugs.""High blood pressure is no longer related to affluence -- as it was in 1975 -- but is now a major health issue linked with poverty,"" said Ezzati./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
PCB for further tests to detect air pollution,"Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala state pollution control board has asked the contractors engaged by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to stop all activities of hot mix plant set up for runway recarpeting works at Trivandrum International Airport for three days. The directive to M S Khurana Engineering Ltd that executes the runway re-tarring work was issued by PCB environmental engineer on Wednesday, following a site inspection conducted by the PCB team.According to the directive, PCB has to conduct ambient air quality monitoring to evaluate the background ambient air quality and emanation of a particular matter on the premises.The directive further states that PCB had received several complaints regarding the working of hot mix plant and directs the company to install additional pollution control measures, including scrubbing and bag filters to reduce to reduce dust emission.The district medical officer (DMO), who has submitted a report to the district collector on the analysis of the medical camp conducted at Vallakadavu on November 6, also found the hot mix plant as a reason for increasing health issues in the area. A total of 291 people from 218 families attended the medical camp conducted by the DMO and NUHM.""It may be the air pollution from the hot mix plant, as no other reason could be found for the skin disease and allergies related to respiration seen among the residents. /The functioning of plant in the densely populated area is harmful to the health of the residents,"" said DMO (in-charge) Dr Jose G D'Cruz in the report.As per the report, 62 people, including 30 children were found suffering from respiratory diseases and 43 people, including 11 children, were found to be suffering from skin diseases for the past six months. More cases related to issues like cough, allergy and asthma were found in the area when compared to other places and in the last three months these cases have worsened,"" states the report submitted by the DMO.District collector S Venkatesapathy said the district administration will initiate stringent steps if the rules are not followed.""The rules should be followed strictly. And, if there are pollution related issues in the area, then pollution control measures should be taken effectively,"" Venkatesapathy said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
NGT curbs to boost air quality fail to meet target,"JAIPUR: The week-long National Green Tribunal (NGT) restrictions in Rajasthan to improve the air quality in the NCR concluded on November 15 have partially achieved the set target. The air quality has improved but has not matched the targeted level in the polluted zones of Rajasthan. The ban on all sorts of construction activities, bricks kilns, hot mix plants, sweeping of roads during the night were lifted from Wednesday till the fresh orders from the NGT. /These restrictions came in a bid to improve the air quality in NCR.The Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) will submit a report to NGT in states level meet to be held in Delhi on Thursday. ""The ban has been lifted and I will share the air pollution data before the committee. The RSPCB will follow the next set of instructions, if at all issued in the meeting,"" said Arun Prasad, member general of RSPCB. Even after half a month has passed to Diwali, the highest particle matter 337 ug/m3 (3.7 times higher than the normal) was recorded at VKIA area in Jaipur at 3pm on Wednesday. This scale of pollution is dangerous for people suffering from heart and lung disease. The advisory under this scale says that old and children should avoid heavy exertion.Whereas the lowest was recorded 136 ug/m3 at RIICO area in Jaipur. The air pollution level is scaled on three parameters-Particle matter, nitrogen oxide and Sulphur dioxide. The Air Quality Index (AQI) data calculated on November 16 has Japiur 258 (AQI) which are 2.5 times higher than the normal. Post Diwali it was hovered around 400-450 for days. While the cleanest air among the places where RSPCB has monitoring stations, Udaipur had 69 AQI on Wednesday afternoon. The restrictions may have lifted but the job for RPCB continues as they have look for power generation plants, brick kilns and hot mix plants, if found to be emitting in excess of prescribed standards, should be ordered to be shut down temporarily and till they take remedial measures and bring the standards within particular limit, says NGT order./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"COPD, a disease of the non-smokers too","PUNE: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) has become the fifth deadliest disease across the globe. COPD is always known to be a smoker's disease. Now, non-smoking COPD has now become one of the major issues in developing countries, say experts.Chest physician Nitin Abhyankar said, ""Lower living standards in a country like India have claimed many lives due to COPD. /It is mostly deadly, because we cannot identify the disease and treat it at the right time. Especially when the patient is non-smoking, the diagnosis takes longer.""Apart from bio mass fuels, the current condition of air pollution has also made COPD a major concern in the urban areas. In terms of air pollution, 10 of the 20 most polluted cities in world are from India. In a survey by the Central Pollution Control Board, lung function reduced in 40.3% individuals in Delhi, as compared with 20.1% in control group.""The quality of air that we breathe today is toxic. With the presence of these nano particles in the air, the functionality of our lung is hampered the most. With these living conditions in the urban region, respiratory ailments are of major concern,"" Abhyankar said. COPD is also a major occupational hazard. A National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted a survey and found that industries and occupations at increased risk of COPD ranged from transportation-related occupations; machine operators; construction trades freight, stock, and material handlers; records processing and distribution clerks; sales and waitresses. The fraction of COPD attributable to work was estimated as 19.2 per cent overall and 31.1 per cent among never smokers.A popular product that finds its way in our homes, especially in summers is the ubiquitous mosquito coil.""It may shock us to learn that the mosquito coil emits as much smoke (PM2.5) as those from 100 cigarettes and as much formaldehyde as those from 50 cigarettes! We may not be regular smokers but unwittingly we are inviting trouble by using products that compromise our health,"" he added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Lung cancer on the rise in non-smokers,"MUMBAI: A growing number of non-smokers in India are reporting lung cancer today, with the disease in them showing more subtle symptoms that are often difficult to diagnose. ""In the US, lung cancer in never-smokers is now considered the 6th most common cause of cancer deaths. While in India, we do not have any such consolidated estimates. /In recent years, doctors have witnessed an increasing number of cases in which the patient was a never smoker and yet acquired lung cancer. Apart from genetic predisposition, the prime causes of lung cancer in non-smokers are air pollution and second hand smoke,"" says Dr Satish Kamat, senior oncologist, AASHA Cancer Centre Hospital.Dr Bharat Bhosale, consultant, medical and haemato oncologist, Bombay Hospital adds that while the most common lung cancer patient will be a male cigarette smoker; the disease is also reported in a large number of former smokers in whom the damage has already been done in their smoking years. ""Yet, around 15 per cent of the patients are those who have never smoked in life, most common examples of this sub-type are women. More than half of the non-smokers who report lung cancer are women,"" he pointed out. Interestingly, oncologists say that cancers in smokers and non-smokers are different on genetic and molecular level since their causes and triggers are different. Dr Ramakant Deshpande, onco surgeon, Asian Cancer Institute said, ""The symptoms of smokers and non smokers when they contract cancer are also different, these symptoms are subtle and occur at a later stage among non smokers. Non-smokers also tend to overlook the symptoms, as they are not aware that they can be at risk of lung cancer. The symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, pain in the back or shoulder or bone pain for non-smokers. Whereas for smokers the symptoms are violent cough or coughing of blood which can immediately be associated to lung cancer."" Currently, cancers in smokers and non-smokers are treated in a similar way but there is a growing consensus among the medical community that these two types of patients need different approach to treatment./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Weather fluctuation troubles citizens,"Nagpur: A difference of 21 degrees between the day and the night temperature coupled with existence of haze in the weather is keeping city doctors busy.The minimum temperature in the city dipped to 11.1 degrees Celsius on Sunday as against the maximum temperature of 32 degrees Celsius. Doctors say that the huge gap is the reason behind rising respiratory ailments among those staying in city.Pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat said, ""Such extreme variation in temperature has bad effects on health. From last few days, a major chunk of patients are suffering from cold and coughs.""He further informed that presence of haze in such a weather makes condition even worse as it gives rise to all kinds of lung related infections and ailments. /There is also 20% rise in patients coming with different type of lung related diseases. People who have asthma and COPD are the worst sufferers as the disease intensifies.Arbat said, such lung infections have been on rise ever since Diwali due to rise in pollution and drop in temperature. ""After Diwali there is a lot of air pollution due to crackers. Because those are the days when people tend to clean houses, there was a lot of dust in the air.""He said, ""The temperature also started declining from that point of time. Pollutants can't mix easily in the environment during winter and they cause infections. In the middle of all that if city experiences temperature variations to this extent, the situation becomes even worse. Patients have been complaining of fever, runny nose, body ache, laryngitis and tonsillitis.""Meanwhile, paediatricians across the city are reporting a long line of worried parents at their clinics. According to them, the allergy-induced cold is more prevalent these days, which later becomes inflectional too.Paediatrician Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala said, ""Fluctuations in temperature makes children younger than five prone to the risk of respiratory ailments, which, if not treated in time, can cause pneumonia due to low immunity. Cold creates an environment easier for the pneumococcal bacteria to move in the lungs and trigger an infection.""Dr Jhunjhunwala also said, ""At the same time, winter is the healthiest season for children. But these kind of drastic weather variations have opposite effects. Right now the OPD is filled with kids coming with viral fever.""In Vidarbha, city had the second highest maximum temperature after Akola (32.6) and was top in the region with its minimum temperature on the same day./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

30% to 60% of lung cancer patients in B'luru are non-smokers: Docs,"<a href=""mailto:Sreemoyee.Chatterjee@timesgroup.comBengaluru"">Sreemoyee.Chatterjee@timesgroup.comBengaluru</a>/: Radha, 54, complained of a sudden hoarseness in her voice and chronic cough only to be diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. Her family was devastated and shocked in equal measure. A doctor herself, Radha led a healthy lifestyle and was a non-smoker. A year later, she succumbed to the killer disease.When Karthik, 45, a software engineer and a fitness freak, visited a city hospital with pain in the right side of his chest, radiology reports revealed water accumulation in his right lung. /The biopsy report threw up a shocker - the techie had adenocarcinoma and the cancer had progressed to its third stage.

Most of them are women. Air pollution, exposure to radiation and passive smoking are the contributing factors.""Of the 500 patients walking into the hospital with lung cancer, at least 200 are non-smokers. The incidence has gone up from 5-6 persons (for a population of 1,00,000) to 12-13 in Bengaluru. In Delhi, the figure stands at 16-17 persons,"" said Dr C Ramesh, professor and head of the epidemiology and biostatistics department at Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology.Dr Neelesh Reddy, consultant oncologist, Columbia Asia hospitals, pointed out that women are at a higher risk. If a man and woman smoke an equal number of cigarettes, it's the woman who is more susceptible to the cancer, he said.Doctors say though most patients diagnosed with lung cancer are from urban and semi-urban areas, the incidence is rising among the rural population as well. ""Many cases are not registered due to the lack of proper healthcare facilities in rural areas,"" Dr Reddy added. According to Dr Ramesh, indoor pollution caused by asbestos and smoke is to blame. Doctors feel the ban on smoking in public places should be implemented more effectively. They also say in over 80% of the cases, the disease is diagnosed only at an advanced stage. ""The government should start screening programmes for both smokers and non-smokers, who should be made to undergo low-dose chest CT scans,"" said Dr BS Ajaikumar, chairman and CEO, Healthcare Global Enterprises Limited (HCG Cancer Hospital).Dr Vivek Anand Padegal, consultant pulmonologist, Fortis Hospital, said many non-smokers respond better to chemotherapy and other forms of treatment compared to smokers. ""Access to oral chemotherapy should be made easier and more affordable,"" he said.

"Supreme Court bans selling of fire crackers in NCR, directs Centre to suspend licenses of all sellers","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday put a blanket ban on selling of fire crackers in National Capital Region in order to curb the life threatening pollution level in Delhi saying the capital was 'smogged' into an environmental emergency of unseen proportions.A bench of Chief Justice T S Thakur and Justices A K Sikri and S A Bobde directed the Centre to suspend all licenses allowing sale of fireworks, wholesale and retail within the NCR and also directed the government not to renew or grant fresh license to sellers till its further order. The court's order would put the firecrackers out of reach to people in Delhi, Noida, Gaziabad, Gurugram and surrounding areas.The court, however, ruled out the proposition to ban use of firecrackers as a measure to curb rising pollution level, saying that ban on use was not feasible as it would be difficult to implement the order.The court said that the life of the citizens of NCR was brought to a virtual standstill due to life-threatening level of pollution, compelling it to intervene to protect life of people. Observing that the adverse effects of the extreme levels of air pollution has spared no one in the city, the court said India has got a distinction of world's highest death rate from chronic respiratory diseases and about 1.5 million people die annually due to indoor and outdoor pollution.""The fall in air quality has had a significant impact on people's lifestyle as well. /The rising costs to protect against air pollution are substantial. It has come to our notice that people are queuing up to purchase protective masks and air purification systems in the wake of dense smog all over the NCR. In short, the capital was smogged into an environmental emergency of unseen proportions,"" the bench said.It said Air Quality Index in the NCR is abysmally severe and allowing trade in fireworks, a major source of noise and air pollution and causing immense harm to the lives and health of citizens, constitutes a serious invasion of the Freedoms and Rights conferred on citizens by the Constitution.Justice Bobde, who wrote the judgement, noted that increase in respiratory diseases like asthma, lung cancer, bronchitis etc. was primarily attributable to the worsening air quality in the NCR. ""Needless to state, the grim situation of air quality adversely affected the right to education, work, health and ultimately, the right to life of the citizens, and this Court is constitutionally bound to address their grave concerns,"" the bench said.""All this firework, even that which is not noisy, leaves the ambient air thick with noxious particles. Marriage processions, barats, passing through an area generated the same kind of noise and leave behind the same kind of air, by the use of fire crackers. It is not necessary to speculate if those who suffer send their good wishes for the event,"" it said.The bench said that ban on selling fire crackers would adversely affect the business of traders but justified its decision saying that the ban was in the larger public interest.""There is no doubt that protecting citizens by making these unavailable in the market would require the suspension of trade of a miniscule section of the population. Maybe they have acquired stocks for sale or obtained credit for their business. We are, however, of the view that balancing the vital interests of the vast majority of citizens against the commercial interests of a few, the balance must heavily tilt in favour of citizens in general,"" it said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Study: Patna's air quality worst in country, again","Patna: The air quality index (AQI) in the state capital on Tuesday stood at 476, the highest in the country and probably the highest-ever in the city. The AQI in Patna was the highest in the country even on Monday and the second highest on Sunday.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has put the AQI in Patna in the 'severe' category, which means breathing such air affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases.Incidentally, the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) had issued an advisory to the state government last year after the AQI of Patna crossed 400 mark in November-December, breaking all its past records in the state capital.The AQI is an assessment of the air quality taking into account eight pollutants: PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 10 micron), PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 micron), nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, ammonia and lead.Air pollution, primarily higher level of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), has been a cause a concern in Patna even on normal days. The level of particulate matter is normally recorded thrice the normal level of respective standard of 100 micrograms per cubic metre. /Even on Tuesday evening, the level of PM2.5 in Patna was measured at 443.99 micrograms per cubic metre. Suspended particulate matter is the biggest contributor to air pollution in the state capital.BSPCB chairman and forest department principal secretary Vivek Kumar Singh admitted the higher level of air pollution in the city and claimed that compressed natural gas (CNG) would be introduced by the end of 2017 to bring down the pollutants level.""Though we have been able to introduce clean brick manufacturing technology, high level of vehicular density in the city still remains a cause of concern. We need to hit the root cause of pollution; hence, we are soon going to introduce CNG for vehicles,"" Singh told TOI.""We are already in talks with GAIL as they are presently developing a CNG pipeline network passing through Bihar. They have assured us to provide the pipeline connectivity to Patna by 2017-end,"" Singh said.BSPCB member-secretary S Chandrashekhar attributed the surge in AQI to the onset of winter conditions and dust on roads. ""The level of particulate matter or dust particles in the air in Patna is recorded quite higher than the respective permissible level. Moreover, November-December is considered a crucial period with regard to the particulate matter. The soot-like particles settle down in low temperature conditions, making the air in the lower level of atmosphere more polluted,"" Chandrashekhar told TOI on Tuesday.He said the BSPCB would issue an advisory to the state government to take necessary action to bring down the 'alarming' level of AQI in the state capital. Incidentally, several recommendations made by the BSPCB in its last year's advisory to curb air pollution are already gathering dust.

"Bad air killing more than expected in India, China: Greenpeace report","NEW DELHI: As countries become richer, air pollution-related deaths reduce. This is the general trend for most nations except India and China, a report released by Greenpeace on Friday has found. The study, which assesses the GDP per capita versus deaths resulting from toxic air, revealed India and China had higher death rates than what is expected of countries with similar per capita GDP. /This is particularly true when deaths caused by air pollution are mapped for 15 middle-income countries.The report also states that air pollution may have caused more than 1.6 million additional deaths than a projected death number based on GDP growth rate for 2015 in India and China collectively. The report sources the number of such deaths from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) report and GDP per capita estimations for all countries from a recent World Bank document.""This report puts a question mark on the quality of economic development the two countries are offering to their people. Usually, air pollution has an inverse relationship with the country's GDP. We find that as countries become richer, they generally develop less polluting industries. But in the case of India and China, the trend has been quite the opposite: despite their economic growth, both countries have particularly poor air quality. It is clear that an economy heavily reliant on coal can only spell doom for its people,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta of Greenpeace East Asia. Although air pollution death rates have fallen in China and India since 1990, they are still worse than in most similar countries, the report said. In India, rates have not improved since 2010. In 2015, pollution claimed 138 and 115 lives per 1,00,000 people in India and China respectively, it added.According to its GDP per capita, the expected death rate in India is 94 per 1,00,000 but its death rate remains 138. ""So, unlike China, it has not yet reached an income level where its air pollution death rate could be expected to be similar to that in rich countries. But in both cases, the comparison with high income countries reflects the potential for significant improvements in air pollution death rates,"" said Sunil Dahiya of Greenpeace India./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

However, the wildlife department is unsure about the decrease in population of these birds and will soon launch a survey. ""It is difficult to maintain a proper count of the migratory birds visiting the state during winter. They come in small groups and are scattered. We will start a survey engaging NGO members, wildlife officials and resource persons within a week to resolve the issue,"" said Lal Ratnakar Singh, principal conservator of forests. The migratory birds arrive in November and return by March every year./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"'Don't burn green waste, compost it'","Navi Mumbai: The green activists have urged the civic body to start composting organic waste in all the municipal gardens instead of burning it and causing air pollution.""We have noticed that most of the civic gardens are not composting the organic waste such as leaves, twigs and grass. These are supposed to be put in a freshly dug up pit. /However the local gardeners are merely burning it, causing smoke, and adding to the air pollution,'' said activist Arati Chauhan of Harit Navi Mumbai group.She added that they found, after a preliminary survey of several civic gardens, that composting is being done at just two or three sites. The waste is set on fire in the rest, she said.""During winter, the density of fine suspended particulate matter (SPM) increases, if a man-made fire is started. This air pollution hovers close to the ground and is unable to escape, leading to respiratory ailments,"" said another activist Anarjit Chauhan,He added that the same scenario was recently seen in Delhi, as the farmers in nearby areas were burning the waste materials in their fields.Chauhan has also reported the about the polluting practice to deputy municipal commissioner (gardens) Tushar Pawar, who has promised to look into the issue.Activist D Stalin of NGO Vanashakti had earlier reported about dry grass along the roads and next to railway tracks being set on fire, adding to air pollution.The green activists have therefore urged the authorities to take preventive action at the earliest for the sake of better air quality index./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Here's what you didn't see at Bhandewadi, Mr Kadam","Nagpur: A peculiar odour swept across Bhandewadi a couple of days ago. It's not often that residents, staying in the unauthorized layouts spread in the periphery of the dump yard, are subjected to this smell. They say it happens only when the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) processing plant composting machine is operated. It also signified another thing: The machine was being operated for the impending visit of a high-ranking official. /""Otherwise,"" residents say, ""shouldn't we be getting the smell more often.""The visit took place on December 7. And the high-ranking official was state environment minister Ramdas Kadam and an entourage that comprised Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) chairman Satish Gavai, member secretary P Anabalagan and municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar. After the inspection, the minister is believed to have found everything in order. ""I will not talk anything now, meet me after the winter session of the assembly,"" Kadam told TOI.But what Kadam saw was only what he was shown. It's what he wasn't shown and informed about that is causing problems to the residents. For several years now, between 7pm and 6am, a heavy smog hangs during winters over Bhandewadi and in a radius of a few kilometres. The problem of air pollution, however, is always the same in any season. And it's not just the vicinity of Bhandewadi. Members of Deshpande Jansamsaya Niwaran Samiti have complained to MPCB that areas like Deshpande Layout, Hiwri Nagar and Vaishnodevi Square are also covered with 'cloud of burnt smell.'Garbage burning in the dump yard seems to be the main cause of air pollution at Bhandewadi where a large percentage of the city's garbage is seen smouldering at regular distances. In May last year, the dump yard was on flames. Even today, there is no end to fire outbreaks, cause of which is not conclusively known. Data available with NMC's fire department shows that fire tenders are sent to Bhandewadi quite often to arrest small fires. In November, tenders were rushed at the site around eight times at morning, noon and evening hours. On Thursday too, there was a fire outbreak.In May last year, TOI has reported that unregulated trash burning is endangering urban lives by pumping cancer-causing pollutants in the atmosphere and also creating a fire hazard for thousands of residents living in the periphery. It's been more than a year and the situation has come to a boil.In winters, the smog is so heavy that residents get trapped in zero visibility. ""In mornings, while going to school, our auto rickshaw driver can't even see the road properly. Last month, a motorist met with an accident,"" says a young girl living behind the dump yard. Jai Shanker Pandey, chief scientist, science secretary and head, climate change in National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri), explains the reason behind smog. ""When the temperature is high and air is warmer, pollution has better diffusivity, which is to say that it dissipates into the air more easily. In winters, thanks to the colder, heavier air, an invisible barrier is created, and the air pollution gets trapped close to the ground. Thus, air pollution becomes a critical problem,"" he says. Unscientific disposal and garbage burning is taking a toll on human health with release of toxic and cancer-causing pollutants into the atmosphere. Fifty-six-year-old Sheikh Mohammad Gulam, who stays around 500 metres away from the dump yard, is severely asthmatic. Every year, between November to January, he spends his nights at a rented room which is three-four kilometres away. ""After 7pm, the smog increases and I face heavy breathlessness. I have all types of pumps and masks but they don't prove to be of much help. So, after dinner, I go to the rented room to sleep,"" said Gulam.Over the years, many unauthorized layouts have come up in what should have been the buffer zone as per the Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000. Stench, mosquitoes and smoke never leave the residents. To escape the polluted air and smell, residents try to keep their houses as tightly packed as they can. Many have filled up the ventilators and open spaces with thermocol and cardboard. ""In last one-and-a half year, my son has been hospitalized six times due to malaria and weakness. Last year, a 20-day-old newborn died, probably due to these unhygienic conditions. Our kids can't step out of the house in evenings,"" says a resident, Munna Tirpude./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Noida's air, and home of birds, under assault","Noida: A bonfire of dried leaves, twigs and tree branches continues to rage on a stretch leading up to the Okhla Bird Sanctuary (OBS), a few steps away from its entrance at the Noida end, despite a standing ban on leaf burning imposed by the National Green Tribunal.The fire is steadily spreading on the horticultural waste lying on the kilometre-long stretch, with no one to care a fig for the lasting damage the smoke is doing to the environment. The green waste is set on fire periodically.The burning of horticultural waste in the area, which is part of the eco-sensitive zone of the OBS, is now a routine affair.Officers and forest guards stationed at the sanctuary told TOI that the horticultural waste was being set on fire by Noida Authority workers themselves. The waste is dumped in the area for some days and then someone turns up one fine day and sets it on fire, an OBS official said.Strangely enough, the Noida Authority's horticulture department feigned ignorance about dumping of waste or the burning. /""The side of the road where the waste is burning is not under our jurisdiction, we can't say who is burning the leaves there,"" Om Bir Singh, director, horticulture, said.""The Noida Authority has repeatedly been advised to not burn horticultural waste in the city. We have told them many times too, especially with the NGT regulations in place, it is a serious violation of the rules.

Gurgaon releases holy smoke to cut air pollution,"GURGAON: With unabating pollution in the city and the inability of government agencies to take adequate steps to improve air quality, residents are now seeking divine intervention to purify the air.Some residents performed a 'havan' (a ritual burning of offerings) on Saturday at Infocity in Sector 33 and offered different items in the fire to please God for purifying the air. They are planning to perform 100 havans in different parts of the city on December 31 by involving a large number of people from different sections of society.""Havan was performed for conservation and protection of the environment and make people aware about pollution and its harmful effects,"" said Pramod Raghav of NGO Niswarth Kadam, who had organised the havan. He said it was also an effort to make people aware about the environment conservation.While the irony of the exercise which entails a degree of air pollution cannot be lost on anyone, the priest who performed the havan said that on the contrary, it actually purifies the air.Upset with the government over its failure to take steps for improvement of air, Sushant Mishra, an IT professional, said, ""Now only God can protect us from air pollution. Instead of doing something about it the government is continuing to fell trees.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Namma Kudla takes a conscious step towards Shuddha Gaali,"MANGALURU: A city-based NGO has taken up Shuddha Gaali, a project to assess the air quality at 12 prominent spots. The project is floated by APD Foundation in association with St George's Homeopathy, a firm promoting better health. OneEarth Enviro Labs, a Mangaluru-based laboratory, is gathering the data. /The results will be submitted to the government for perusal and action. This will also help Mangalureans understand air quality levels based on five different parameters in their areas.""In the drive to make Mangaluru the least-polluted city in the country, we'll monitor air pollution, principal sources and begin work on mitigation of pollution at the points of origin. Pilikula was the last of the 12 spots we identified to test air quality,"" said Abdullah A Rehman, founder, APD Foundation. ""Air pollution is the silent killer and considered a major cause of death and the source of many life-threatening diseases, affecting vital organs of the human body. Ranked the fifth largest killer in India, it's also the most contributing cause of asthma in children. Mangaluru is ranked eighth among the cleanest cities in India and is among the least-polluted cities. But in the recent past, with drastic increase in population, vehicular movement and unplanned infrastructure development, the city has seen a rise in traffic congestion and pollution levels. The growing menace of air pollution in New Delhi has raised many tough questions,"" Abdullah said.The government has placed air quality monitoring station in Baikampady, an industrial enclave while residents live in the city limits. ""We have no understanding of the air quality measures in areas of our residence or work. We have no understanding of quality of air our children breathe in their schools. In the light of this concern, APD for the citizens of Mangaluru, has aggregated experts to commence a study on air quality of Mangaluru city. This project will vastly bridge the gap for the Government to act accordingly in terms of mitigation of air pollution in the city and to achieve the status of least polluted city in India. This project will also help us to understand if the Air quality in Mangaluru city limits meets the National Ambient,"" he said. Ambient air quality monitoring under five parameters including particulate matter (SPM/RSPM), PM10, SPM, PM2, SO2, NO2 and lead have been done at PVS Junction, Hampankatta, Bunder, Central Market, Lalbagh, Bejai, Jyothi Circle, Nanthoor, Baikampady, Pumpwell, Kankanady and Attavara for eight hours.

"Winters and air pollution double risk of disease in elders, kids","LUCKNOW: Battling diseases and infections is a twin challenge in winters, say doctors in the city. Blaming air pollution for complicating the situation, they said that children, sick and elderly suffered more than anyone else.""While winter itself leads to physiological changes which make one vulnerable to illnesses, pollution adds to the risk. The reason is that humidity level which goes up significantly in winter months brings air pollutants in their breathing range which doubles the risk of disease,"" said Dr BP Singh, private pulmonologist.Professor and head of pulmonology department, AIIMS New Delhi, Dr Randeep Guleria stated that exposure to cold causes constriction of airways due to which less air reaches the lungs. /""The problem aggravates when we breathe polluted air. They cause irritation and inflammation of the airways. New research shows pm2.5 tends to spill over to the bloodstream as well, causing narrowing of the blood vessels that could lead to heart attack or stroke,"" he said.Physician Dr DP Mishra said that children, elderly and sick is low are an easy target because their immunity level is comparatively low. ""Children suffer because they breathe more than elders every minute and their immune system is not fully developed, they are at a higher risk of disease. Elders on the other hand have a fragile system. The sick are at a risk because their immune system stays busy at fighting their existing disease,"" he explained.He added that chronic exposure to high-level pollutants is regarded as big a risk factor for heart attack and stroke as high cholesterol and smoking. ""Patients at both extremes of age are vulnerable due to weaker immunity,"" he stated.Persistent high pollution also prolongs the recovery period for patients admitted for respiratory diseases. Dr Ved Prakash at King George's Medical University said prevention is the best cure. ""Outdoor activity of people with known history of a lung disease should be restricted on times of the day - like early morning - when pollution levels are high. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination is advised to those predisposed to infections,"" he stated.The double attack has already landed many to city hospitals. ""The number of elders falling prey to seasonal chest infections or aggravated medical condition has doubled in the past fifteen days,"" said geriatric physician, Dr Abhishek Shukla who attended 30-35 patients per day on an average in November.

Karnataka state pollution control board vans to help Regional transport authority check air pollution,"MYSURU: Users of vehicles emitting smoke beyond permissible limits and causing air pollution will have to be careful. Reason: Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) will soon introduce an emission testing van to check air pollution in Mysuru city. KSPCB will assist Regional Transport Authority (RTA) officials in checking air pollution by vehicles, and the latter will initiate action against erring vehicle users. /If caught, the offenders will have to cough up Rs 1,000 for the first offence, and Rs 2,000 for the second and subsequent offences. The move is expected to effectively facilitate the authorities to check pollution by vehicles. In the absence of a mobile emission testing unit, RTO officials hitherto had difficulty in checking pollution. Now, they can avail the services of KSPCB for the same.Penalty based on reportKSPCB officer M G Raghuram said the board has purchased 16 mobile emission testing vans in Karnataka. Of them, 8 will be used in Bengaluru and others in Mysuru, Kalaburagi, Mangaluru and Dharwad districts. ""Our officers will assist RTO officials during special drives and give a report on emission levels on the spot. Transport officials will penalize motorists if their vehicles are polluting (referring to the report),"" he added.The service will be launched by KSPCB in Mysuru on Wednesday. Initially, the vehicle will be used in city areas. If required, it will be taken to neighbouring districts Mandya, Kodagu, Chamarajanagar and Hassan, which also come under KSPCB.An RTO official said that due to lack of facility, they were not checking if vehicles were polluting. But they were ensuring that vehicles adhere to emission norms when they are brought to their office for any document work like transfer of ownership and fitness certificate. As per statistics, Mysuru has just over 6 lakhs vehicle, of which 85% are two-wheelers./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Visakhapatnam: Guard against Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease cases in winter,"VISAKHAPATNAM: Last month, World COPD Day was observed on the theme 'Breathe in the Knowledge'. Usually, in winter, owing to the cold and air pollution, including suspended smog, COPD cases coming to the hospital increase by about 30 per cent.Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) refers to a number of breathing problems damaging the breathing tubes and air sacs within the lungs. It's a common lung disease that obstructs the airways, making breathing difficult. Inhaling certain dust, fumes, chemicals or gases in the workplace can cause serious long-term lung damage.According to estimates of the World Health Organisation (WHO), globally around 210 million people are suffering from COPD and by 2030, this life-threatening lung disease would become the third leading cause of death worldwide.The primary cause of COPD is tobacco smoke (through tobacco use or secondhand or passive exposure to smoke) as well as exposure to excessive air pollution - both indoor air pollution (such as biomass fuel used for cooking and heating) and outdoor air pollution and smog, occupational dusts and chemicals (vapours, irritants, and fumes). Though not curable, but it can be prevented and the progress of the disease can be slowed down through treatment.Medical superintendent of Government Hospital for Chest and Infectious Diseases Dr Sambasiva Rao said, ""Though throughout the year we get patients suffering from COPD, the number usually goes up in winter by up to 30 per cent due to the cold climate and increased pollutants suspended in the air as smog, a harmful combination of smoke and fog.""Dr Anantha Lakshmi, chest physician at Care Hospital averred, ""Since there is no cure but it can be treated, the earlier it's detected, the better the results of treatment. /Medicines that help dilate major air passages of the lungs can improve shortness of breath. Adults may have COPD if they have trouble breathing, or feel short of breath or develop a cough that refuses to go away. COPD is confirmed by a simple diagnostic test called 'spirometry' that measures how much air a person can inhale and exhale and how fast air can move into and out of the lungs. Because COPD develops slowly, it's frequently diagnosed in people aged 40 years or older.Suggesting the measures which one can follow to prevent or control COPD, pulmonologists point to the need to absolutely quit smoking and getting oneself secured from passive smoking. ""One should strictly adhere to medicines as suggested by the doctor and visit the doctor at least twice a year for check-ups and visit the hospital right away if the breathing worsens. One should keep the air clean at home and stay away from things such as smoke that make it hard to breathe. Also, keep the body strong. Walk, exercise regularly and eat healthy foods,"" stated Dr Lakshmi.Also, many people have the habit of going for regular morning and evening walks. ""However, it's advisable that during winters, people should undertake morning walks a little late after sunrise, when the fog or smog is cleared. They should also try to be inside the house after 7 pm as during the early morning and late evenings, harmful pollutants including smog gets suspended in the air and adversely affects the lungs. People should also use masks if it's absolutely necessary to go out in the smoke,"" suggested Dr Sambasiva Rao./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

""During this season, anyone who experience tightening in the chest, chronic breathlessness and persistent cough must seek medical attention immediately,"" he advised. He suggests that patients who suffer from asthma or any other pre-existing condition, must ensure to take their medication regularly. For children, a persistent cold and cough that stays over a week is not a healthy sign and must be checked.""If you're an athlete, try to wear a mask over your mouth and nose. It will reduce the amount of pollutants you may be inhaling. If you are working out or running, select an indoor space or some place away from traffic or highways,"" he added. On days when the air is especially bad, added Dr Chhajed, avoid getting outdoors. He suggested that if you have a work-from-home policy, try to do so at least every alternate day.

Puri Swargadwar chimney lying defunct since 2014,"BHUBANESWAR: The Puri municipality is allegedly sitting over the direction of the Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB) to operationalize the scientific chimney installed at 'Swargadwar' (crematorium) to filter the smoke emanating during burning of bodies. At least 40 bodies are cremated at Swargadwar every day. Since Puri is a holy place, people prefer to take the bodies there for cremation. /The Swargadwar, located along the sea beach, leaves smoke as the bodies are burnt in the open instead of under the chimney. The chimney, installed by the OSPCB in 2014 remained functional for only eight months. Meanwhile, the OSPCB has sent three reminders to the Puri civic body to fix the problem. Around seven bodies can be burnt at a time below the platform where the chimney has been installed. ""Pollution board sources said the defunct chimney is leading to huge air pollution. The open burning of bodies leaves particulate matter (Pm-10) of 727 microgram per metre cube from the cremation ground against the permissible limit of 100,"" said OSPCB regional officer (Bhubaneswar) Hadibandhu Panigrahi.A environment campaigner, Subash Dutta, had filed a petition in National Green Tribunal (NGT) regarding the rising pollution level in the town due to crematorium. The NGT then directed the OSPCB and the Puri municipality to filter the smoke and thereafter the scientific chimney was installed. The OSPCB later handed over the chimney maintenance work to the Puri civic body, which since then has failed to make it operationalize it. ""Recently we floated expression of interest (EoI) inviting interested parties for the repair of the chimney. But none came forward. We will consult with the pollution board officials to help us hire an expert in the field to fix the problem,"" said executive officer (Puri municipality) Sanjay Mishra.

Arvind Kejrwal's odd-even model can cut deadly vehicular emissions,"HYDERABAD: The city may soon have to replicate Delhi chief minister Kejriwal's odd-even rule to combat the rising levels of pollution, indicates data available with pollution monitoring bodies.Deadly pollutants including sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide are adding to the air pollution in city besides the rising PM 2.5 levels.According to S Jeevanand Reddy, the convener of the Forum for Sustainable Environment, the main cause of particulate matter in the air is vehicular emission.""While the advancement in the vehicular technology should have brought the pollution levels down, it had not been the case in Hyderabad. Goods vehicles continue to use adulterated fuel here to cut costs. Emissions from vehicles are the chief contributors of NOx or oxides of nitrogen. /When they react with other particles in the air, there can be an increase in the ground-level ozone content. This, in turn, leads to severe health complications. City buses, which are more than 15 years old, are also major pollutants,"" he said.Reddy has done extensive studies on air pollution in the city.The state pollution control board's figures only reinstate the ugly reality. While in 2010, the NOx levels in pockets such as Jubilee Hills and Charminar varied between 16 and 17, it shot up to 24.2 and 32.1 respectively in 2015.The scenario is no different this year. In July, the NOx levels in the Charminar region stood at 22.3, while the same jumped to 32.5 in October. The sulphur dioxide content has also seen a steady increase in this area. From 4.8 in July 2016, the SO2 level in the Charminar region shot up to 5.1 in October. In Jubilee Hills, the SO2 level has jumped from 4.5 in July to 4.9 in October.Doctors are predictably worried. ""There has been an exponential increase in the number of people showing up with respiratory conditions and breathing difficulties the past few months. While initial symptoms of exposure to polluted air include breathlessness, dry cough and tightness in the chest, prolonged exposure can even lead to diseases such as cancer. Authorities must act now to prevent a Delhi-like situation from playing out here,"" said SA Rafi, consultant pulmonologist at Care Hospitals in Banjara Hills.Doctors recommend wearing masks to avoid the problem, but it is effective only for large particle and can't prevent small particles being inhaled./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Govt asks farmers to stop burning sugarcane thrash,"Bengaluru: As part of its smoke-management strategy, the Karnataka government has issued a diktat to farmers: Stop burning sugarcane thrash in the fields.The move comes in the backdrop of the recent Delhi smog which was fuelled by the burning of paddy straw in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana. In fact, the soaring pollution levels and falling visibility levels in the National Capital Region had not only set alarm bells ringing a fortnight ago but also triggered a blame game between the Delhi government, the neighbouring states and the Centre.The practice of burning sugarcane residue is rampant in at least ten districts across Karnataka.Taking a cue from the Delhi episode, Karnataka has got into a prevention mode. Agriculture minister C Krishna Byregowda has commenced talks with farmers' groups. He has instructed the agriculture department's field units to stop farmers from burning crop residue.Speaking to STOI, Byregowda said: ""About 50 lakh tonnes of sugarcane residue (which comprises the leafy extraneous material and stalk tops after the cane is cut and transported to sugar factories) is burnt by farmers during the harvest season. /The amount of smoke and ash from these fires is huge and the health hazards posed are difficult to fathom. Worst affected by the burning of crop will be the cities of Bengaluru, Mysuru and Belagavi as the major sugarcane-growing districts are Mandya, Belagavi and Bagalkot.""An acre of sugarcane produces around 4,000 tonnes of thrash. With sugarcane being grown on 12 lakh hectares in the state, the sugarcane residue is said to be around 50 lakh tonnes.The agriculture department shot off a letter on December 12 to all chief executive officers of sugarcane-growing districts explaining the emergency. The missive stated: ""Burning residue is not just a loss to agriculture but also pollutes environment and causes ailments and deaths. Air pollution in India causes more than 1,500 premature deaths per day; this is more than one death per minute. For 12 lakh acres of sugarcane in Karnataka, it amounts to burning 48 lakh tonnes of valuable organic matter. This will emit tens of thousands of toxic pollutants into the air.""The department wants sugarcane farmers to use technology and convert the waste into manure.Byregowda said: ""The cane residue is valuable organic matter that should be incorporated into the soil. It will increase cane yield and improve soil sustainability. We want our farmers to hire tractor-mounted cane thrash shredders which are available at reasonable rates from the Krishi Yantra Dhare Kendras (farm equipment rental centres), and convert thrash into organic manure.""Initially, the government contemplated imposing a blanket ban on burning sugarcane residue. ""But before doing that we chose to create awareness and motivate farmers to stop burning, We want to stop pollution levels from soaring further."" Byregowda said.What is sugarcane thrash?A sugarcane plant consists of 75-80% stalk, from which juice is extracted to make sugar. The remaining 20-25 per cent consists of leafy material and stalk tops; these are considered sugarcane residue or thrash or remnants.Where does cane burning happen?It usually happens in the sugarcane-growing districts of Bagalkot, Bidar, Belagavi, Chamarajanagar, Davanagere, Kalaburagi, Hassan, Mandya, Mysore and Vijayapura.Why do farmers burn it?Burning is the easiest and quickest way to get rid of large volumes of trash - and is less labour-intensive. It is not be an additional financial burden on farmers as it involves no transportation or disposal costs. Burning is believed to raise productivity, and shortens harvesting time by a couple of days./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Industry's top choice of fuel cheap but deadly,"NEW DELHI: The national capital region (NCR) may be one of the most polluted regions in the country but many industries located here are still running on an extremely polluting fuel-furnace oil.A substantially cheaper alternative to natural gas and diesel, FO, as it is called in industrial terminology , is marginally better than bitumen in quality .It emits substantially higher particulate matter (PM) and secondary sulphate particles, said scientists.The widespread use of FO came to light only recently after the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) investigated its use in NCR and submitted a report to SC. The report also highlighted the use of pet coke, another high sulphur fuel, in NCR.Industries in Ghaziabad's Sahibabad and Loni Road industrial areas admit that they use FO despite knowing how harmful it is for environment. A large steel company TOI visited in Sahibabad, for instance, runs its generator on FO and natural gas.""It's a 30:70 ratio, with FO making 70% of the fuel. It's cheap and serves the purpose. /I don't think the Supreme Court can ban it because industries are a powerful lobby . Also, what will oil refineries do with the FO they generate?"" said its head of purchase. FO is priced around Rs 25 per litre, compared to Rs 56.76 for diesel, Rs 69.3 for petrol and Rs 24.5 per standard cubic meter for piped natural gas.About three months ago, the price of FO fell to Rs 15 per litre due to the dip in crude oil prices. ""The prices fell seven times in the past year or so. It just makes economic sense for industries to opt for a cheaper fuel. Of course, it's way more polluting and you can tell from the chimney smoke whether a factory is using FO. It's usually black or blue smoke. That's why we invested in piped gas supply ,"" said a senior representative from another steel company's hot rolling and heat treatment division.TOI also found several dyeing, paper recycling and glass industries using FO.A representative from Indo Petro, a dealer, said, ""Many industries in Delhi too use it illegally because it's cheaper.""Anant Bhargav, director of IFP Petro Products, said, ""The government can have Bharat Standard (BS)-type norms for industrial fuel. Some industries even use very toxic tyre oil made from used rubber and ty res. Major dealers supply these fuels.""Around 30 forging industries use FO in Ghaziabad, added an Industrial Area Manufacturer's Association member.Mukesh Sharma, scientist at IIT Kanpur and author of Comprehensive Study on Air Pollution and Green House Gases (GHGs) in Delhi -the latest source apportionment study , said, ""The PM emissions from FO are substantially higher than other liquid or gaseous fuels. Since the sulphur content in FO and pet coke is high, a large amount of sulphur dioxide (SO2) is released that converts into fine sulphate particles in the atmosphere.""The sulphur content in FO is 15,000 to 20,000 ppm and about 70,000 ppm in pet coke compared to around 50 ppm in diesel. Scientists recommend that high sulphur fuel should only be used in cement industries because the calcium oxides generated in these factories can neutralise the sulphur emission.During a recent hearing in SC, a lawyer representing the Centre sought time to respond to EPCA 's submission. The apex court has given the Centre four weeks to examine whether pet coke and FO, if used as industrial fuel, is harmful.""In case the government comes to the conclusion that its use is indeed harmful, it may consider issuing appropriate directions in terms of Section 3(2)(v) of the Air Act,"" the order said.According to EPCA 's report, a big manufacturer of solar panels, a glass company and steel companies are using FO. Apart from PSUs, a private company also supplies FO./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Hair, sperm, libido: Delhi men on the losing side","NEW DELHI: At the end of 2016, there's bad news for Delhi men - they are losing their hair, sperm and libido.A new survey conducted by a city-based healthcare startup found that 63% of Delhi men (between the ages of 30-40) have a sperm count of less than 10 million/ml. That's half of the national average of 20 million/ml, according to a 2013 AIIMS report.The survey conducted by Dalmia Medicare analysed 1, 90,000 diagnostic tests carried out in the Delhi NCR region in 2016 to come up with these findings. ""When we started the study in January, the percentage of men with a low sperm count was 14%. By November, this had risen to 27%,"" says Dr Sunita Yadav, head quality, Dalmia Medicare. /Delhi men also fared poorly in their testosterone tests with 60% of those tested falling in the lower range -- below 300-350 (normal range is 300-1200ng/dl). Dr Yadav blamed stress, smoking, increased air pollution as some of the factors for this trend. Other scientific studies too have linked air pollution to poor quality of semen. A 2014 study done by researchers in China found that city-dwelling men had higher levels of abnormally shaped sperm, and with low motility, than their rural counterparts. The Delhi survey also found that 70% of men (average age 25) faced some kind of hair loss. Majority of them were found to be deficient in Vitamin B complex mainly B3 and B12. Smokers also had a high incidence of hair loss as compared to non-smokers since nicotine hampers blood flow and affects hair growth./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Pollution up, threatens to play party pooper","GURGAON: Pre-Christmas shopping rush, coupled with changing wind patterns, has pushed up the level of air pollution in the city alarmingly, threatening to choke the year-end revelry over the next week.According to data available with the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), Gurgaon witnessed a 45% increase in the average concentration of PM 2.5 and almost a 20-fold rise in the level of carbon monoxide (CO) on Friday.The highest average concentration of PM2.5 was reported to be 394.67 \xB5g/m3 in the day, as against 270.52 \xB5g/m3 on Thursday and 118.95 \xB5g/m3 on Wednesday.What came as a bigger shock was that the level of CO also was unusually high on Friday. Against a normal of 4 \xB5g/m3, the CO level went through the roof to touch 41.18 \xB5g/m3. The level of the pollutant, mainly generated by smoke-belching diesel-run vehicles, was only 1.97 \xB5g/m3 on Thursday and 3.75 \xB5g/m3 the day before.Further, after December 17, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in the city again touched 402 (severe or hazardous mark) on Friday. /It was well below 300-mark on Thursday and Wednesday.HSPCB officials claimed that citizens seemed to have swung into a party mood in view of the Christmas, as well as the weekend, triggering a massive rush and congestion on the city roads. ""The sudden rise in vehicular movement and snarls has increased the CO level. People are rushing to markets, office-goers have left their work place early to prepare for the parties on Saturday and Sunday, causing jams. The increase in the CO level can be linked directly to the spurt in vehicular pollution, especially caused by ones run on diesel,"" said an official of HSPCB.He added that the authorities concerned should immediately slam the brakes on diesel autos to rein in the pollution level.As far as the PM 2.5 level is concerned, the official said, the rise in toxic particles was due to the drop in the temperature. The Met office has forecast more polluted days in the run-up to the New Year. ""The temperature drops below 2 degrees Celsius in the city around this time of the year. However, this year, the mercury level is still hovering around the 4 degrees Celsius. And if PM2.5 is already crossing the 400 mark, it is a matter of serious concern. The temperature is expected to drop further in the first 10 days of January, entrapping more pollutants in the lower atmospheric level. Eventually, PM2.5 level will go up with the dip in the mercury mark,"" said a Met official.Some experts believe the burning of agricultural waste in neighbouring districts has also contributed to the city's rising air pollution levels. ""CO can travel long distances and stay in the atmosphere for more than a month. I think it is due to stubble burning, which happened in November in various parts of Punjab and Haryana, but the smoke is still gliding down to the city due to ever-changing wind patterns. The wind speed has increased from 0.21m/s on Wednesday to 0.79m/s on Friday, drawing in more pollution,"" said Sudhir Pandey, a retired Delhi University professor of environmental sciences.Dr Nirmala Singh, a city-based pulmonologist, said: ""The rise in the CO level can cause shortness of breath and obstruction in delivery of oxygen to organs.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Negligence towards public health and environment is the most worrying issue',"NAGPUR: Why would a young postgraduate from France come to Nagpur for pursuing research? For 24-year-old Alexia Courtois, concern over public health was one of the driving forces.Coming all the way from Nimes (southern France), Alexia is working as a research intern at the environmental health division of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) since last two months. Her research is mainly based on air pollution. Though many might wonder why she chose to do her internship here, for her, it turned out to be a better experience.She talks to TOI about various issues concerning environment, demonetisation and importance of research. /Q. How different is research here when compared to countries like France?A. In France, people are very individual and independent. Here, everything that we do - analysis, discussions, sampling - is done together in a team. This dependency is definitely bringing in more efficiency and interest, something that I wouldn't have got to experience in my native place. Young researchers here are better and government should extend huge financial support to them.Q. What are the major challenges the country faces? A. Negligence towards public health and environment is the most worrying issue for the country. Both go hand in hand. As environment is not being taken seriously, public health is getting adversely affected. Number of deaths due to air pollution in India is increasing at an alarming rate. A large number of people here are suffering from diseases like asthma, cancer, bronchitis and other respiratory problems.Q. Who is to be blamed for this?A. While it would be unfair to blame an individual or agency, mainly the government is at fault. We can see the results of its laxness in New Delhi. The warning signs were always there but the government waited for things to get worse.Q. What measures can developing cities like Nagpur take to avoid such problems?A. When it comes to air pollution, Nagpur might be better than cities like Delhi and Mumbai. But that doesn't mean we can sit back and relax. The situation is still bad. During ten minutes of walking from my home to the institute, I can feel my face all covered up in dust. The city is rich in green cover and the authorities should value and conserve that.Q. What are the major sources of air pollution here?A. In Nagpur, lack of public transport is a major reason. There are hardly any options, public buses are very few and in terrible condition. Most of the citizens commute through their personal two-wheelers and cars, which contributes significantly to air pollution. Other sources are thermal power plant and the large number of industries.Q. Why environmental laws are not being implemented in full force?A. If an industry is found violating environmental norms in France or other countries, it is shut down. Here, action-taking approach is missing. Just like in Delhi, Paris too went for odd even formula and it is still following it whenever pollution level is recorded high. Such steps should be continuous to get long-term solutions. Q. Your views on demonitisation.A. Just after four days I came here, the Prime Minister announced the big move. It came as a big shock as moves like banning currencies are unthinkable in our country. I would go to ATMs after midnight or early mornings. Though it is too early to judge the move, it will surely help in checking black money to some extent./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"THE SEX FACTOR - Hair, sperm, libido: Delhi men are on the losing side","At the end of 2016, there's bad news for Delhi men -they are losing their hair, sperm and libido.A new survey conducted by a city-based healthcare startup found that 63% of Delhi men (between the ages of 30 and 40) have a sperm count of less than 10 millionml. That's half of the national average of 20 millionml, according to a 2013 AIIMS report.The survey conducted by Dalmia Medicare analysed 1,90,000 diagnostic tests carried out in Delhi-NCR in 2016 to come up with these findings. ""When we started the study in January , the percentage of men with a low sperm count was 14%.

"Farm residue can fire your cars, cut fuel import bill","NEW DELHI: The red patches in Nasa photos, indicating small fires dotting the plains of Punjab in early October, were plain enough. By early November, the patches got more intense, as blazing crop stubble and billowing smoke became a common sight in Punjab and even west UP. Shortly thereafter, alarm bells went off in Delhi as the pall of grey-white smoke drifted towards the city and its surrounding areas, choking residents who were already finding it difficult to breathe due to the particulate matter left hanging in the air by smoke-belching trucks and construction activities. /There might be some solution in sight as the biofuels industry now says fuel-grade ethanol could be a more valuable product from crop residue that, when burnt, not only causes air pollution but literally sends crores of rupees up in smoke. According to Pramod Chaudhari, executive chairman of Praj Industries, a leading biofuels technology provider, 250 litres of fuel grade bio-ethanol can be produced from a tonne of farm residue using second-generation processing technology. A step towards increasing biofuel availability will be taken when Pradhan and food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal lay the foundation stone on Sunday of the first bio-ethanol refinery at Bathinda in poll-bound Punjab. Alive to the issue, the government has asked state-run fuel retailers to set up bio-ethanol refineries. ""Second-generation ethanol production technology using rice-paddy straw in Punjab and Haryana will be a permanent solution to crop burning,"" oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said in a November 7 tweet. Estimates, including those by Nasa, pegged the quantity of farm residue burnt at 32 million tonnes in Punjab alone. This could mean some six billion litres of bio-ethanol. This can also translate into a big saving for the country, which meets 80% of its crude requirement through imports, since adequate availability of bio-ethanol will boost the government's plan to achieve 20% blending of petrol and diesel by 2021-22. That level of blending, a recent report by the Dehradun-based University of Petroleum and Energy Studies said, could save $6.12 billion in oil import bill. Besides producing bio-ethanol for the fuel blending programme, the new refineries will provide additional income for farmers, create jobs in rural areas and help air quality management./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Monday breaks haze spell but pollution remains high,"GURGAON: Compared to the grey Christmas, Monday was bright and sunny, but pollution continued to hover at levels dangerously higher than the national safe standard.According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the 24-hour average concentration of PM2.5 was 220.31 micrograms per cubic metre (\xB5g/m\xB3) on Monday, lower than 402.23\xB5g/m\xB3 on Sunday and 333.40\xB5g/m\xB3 on Saturday. However, air quality index (AQI) remained at nearly 200. The national safe standard for PM2.5 is 60 \xB5g/m\xB3.Experts requested authorities to ban diesel vehicles, especially autos, and close down polluting industries, stone crushers and brick kilns. ""We need to work on an immediate reaction mechanism when air pollution goes up. /For instance, temporary closure of highly polluting units, stone crushers and brick kilns, restricting entry of diesel vehicles for some time and ban on diesel vehicles, would keep the situation from deteriorating. This is done in Beijing, for example, when pollution becomes very high,"" said Niranjan Raje, former member of the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority.""Diesel autos are major culprits. They should at least be restricted during winter, when pollution is already high. Not only polluting industrial units, but stone crushers, brick kilns and construction sites should also be shut down for some time,"" said Jitender Bhadana of NGO Save Aravali.City-based environmental analyst Chetan Agarwal, however, said authorities should look for a permanent solution. ""In a year, 90% of the time, the city witnesses PM2.5 above the prescribed level. In winters, it gets worse due to the atmospheric condition. There is definitely a need to take concrete steps, like conversion of diesel autos into electric or CNG, as they are important means of transport for the poor,"" he said.Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) accepted the need to take permanent measures, but said the situation had improved on Monday. ""A dip in temperature led to rise in PM2.5 on Sunday. The situation improved on Monday due to better sunlight. We need to take permanent measures, like converting diesel autos into electric. Restricting entry of commercial diesel vehicles for a short while will not do. Polluting units, stone crushers and brick kilns can definitely be closed if the situation gets worse,"" said a HSPCB official./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Bengaluru's stifling problem: Greying air,"Bengaluru's air has become significantly more toxic, according to a recent study. Air quality measured in the city over an eight-year period in six locations revealed that while sulphur dioxide levels had decreased, airborne particulate matter have either been 'high' or 'critical' in most areas.The research project selected industrial, commercial, residential and sensitive areas of the city, including Graphite India Ltd, Whitefield Road; KHB Industrial Area, Yelahanka; Peenya Industrial area, Regional Office Peenya; Victoria Hospital, Chamrajpet; AMCO Batteries, Mysore Road; and Yeshwanthpur Police Station (YPR).The eight-year trend analysis between 2006 and 2013, showed that the overall percentage increase in airborne particulate matter was 216 per cent in KHB, 161.2 per cent in AMCO, 119.3 per cent in Victoria Hospital, 80.3 per cent at YPR, 76.5 per cent at Graphite India, and 17.5 per cent in Peenya.MORE VEHICLES, MORE POLLUTION The main source of pollution in the city is the. It contributes to almost 50 per cent of the pollution. The other contributors are construction activities, paved and unpaved road dust, domestic pollution and the increased use of diesel generator sets, said experts.Anitha Chinnaswamy, lead researcher from Coventry University, UK, said in her findings: ""All six areas have varying levels of PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometres or less in diameter), with pollution classifications as mainly high or critical. /Across all areas, the concentration level of PM10 in 2013 was critical. Overall, four air pollutants, namely sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, suspended particulate matter and respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM/PM10), were monitored at all locations.""""Based on data obtained from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) for eight years, the paper critically analysed the trend of pollutants identified by the six air quality monitoring stations managed by KSPCB, within their respective areas of coverage and, based on that analysis, alert both researchers and local authorities to the necessity of overcoming the limitations of insufficient monitoring,"" she said.Her previous research project, taking Bengaluru as a case study, had for the first time established a link between deaths due to cardiovascular diseases and high levels of particulate matter that are 10 micrometres or less in diameter, referred to as 'PM10.""In general, particulate matter causes a wide range of diseases and its presence is said to be more dangerous to human health than any other common air pollutant,"" she added.HEALTH RISKSThe current paper says that the three industrial areas varied in air quality classification from moderate to critical, with KHB industrial area generally having fluctuating levels of pollution.In 2013, the level of PM10 in KHB was at its highest - an alarming 182 micrograms per cubic metre (\xB5g/m3) - across the eight years under consideration. (The World Health Organisation [WHO] safe limit for annual mean of PM10 levels is 20 \xB5g/m3. A WHO report earlier this year had showed that PM10 level for Bengaluru was 118 \xB5g/m3.)The levels found at Graphite industrial area were also alarmingly high, revealed the analysis. The PM10 values of 194 \xB5g/m3 in 2007, and 184 \xB5g/m3 in 2009, were over three times above the acceptable limit.The level in 2013 stood at 162 \xB5g/m3, which was 2.7 times the acceptable limit.Victoria Hospital consistently maintained a high level of PM10 pollution, from 2006 to 2012. However, in 2013 this level shot up to 152 \xB5g/m3, three times that of the previous year and over 2.5 times the safe limit set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the researchers observed.""The same observation applies to the two residential areas of Yeshwanthpur (YPR) and AMCO, where there was a respective significant increase in concentration in 2013, in comparison with the seven previous years,"" said the multi-national research team.""For Bengaluru, the critical levels of PM are likely to have a damaging effect on the health of the citizens that may result in a tremendous burden on the public health system. Additionally, if this were to affect the skilled young human resource, it would pose a threat to the city's economy. Therefore, it is of vital importance that the government addresses the issue of health impact due to air pollution by adhering to stringent measures of pollutants' control,"" the researchers said.OTHER POLLUTANTSAccording to the researchers, the sources of, applicable to the city, are mainly due to the burning of fossil fuels and diesel exhaust, and the health effects attributable to it are known to be inflammation of the respiratory tract, lung damage, and irritation in the eyes, mucous membranes and the skin.Their analysis showed that generally the levels of sulphur dioxide tended to decrease in these areas.""Since fuel type and quality are one of the major contributors to sulphur dioxide, the overall decreasing trend may be attributed to various regulatory measures taken, such as the reduction of sulphur in diesel fuel and the wider use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), instead of coal, as domestic fuel,"" said Chinnaswamy.The researchers analysed levels of nitrogen oxide, exposure to which, according to experts, is linked to adverse respiratory effects and airway inflammation in healthy people, and increased respiratory symptoms in people with asthma.Assessment shows that in both YPR and AMCO residential areas, nitrogen oxide concentration levels over the year 2009 were at their highest, with a moderate air pollution classification.However, over the subsequent years to 2013, there was a consistent decrease in nitrogen oxide pollution and, its concentration levels decreased by 24.4 per cent and 23.8 per cent in YPR and AMCO, respectively.""Industrial areas of KHB, Graphite and Peenya saw similar peaks in its concentration levels in 2009 (except for Graphite, where the highest level of 50.7\xB5g/m3 was reached in 2006) before assuming a generally downward trend. In Victoria too, there was a similar pattern, with 2009 marking a peak value, followed by a downward trend,"" said the findings.The researchers said a possible explanation for the universal increased nitrogen oxide concentration level in 2009 may be attributed to the increase in the number of cars. ""Although the number of vehicles (whether registered or not) has been generally increasing in Bengaluru, the number of registered vehicles, particularly over 2007-09, saw an exponential increase of over half a million additional vehicles. As motor vehicle exhaust emissions are one of the major contributors to nitrogen oxide dispersion, this noticeable increase in vehicular traffic could have contributed to the significant increase in levels in 2009,"" they added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Cooking emissions an overlooked contributor to air pollution,"KOLKATA: The skyline on this part of the country turns grey by afternoon. By dusk, a thick layer of smog envelops the horizon. With winter setting in, millions living in rural and suburban India has many reasons to worry about, one of it being air pollution. The surroundings suffer from choking smog and acrid smell in the air, most of which are the result of smoke from chulhas and conventional cook stoves used by millions at their homes. /While climatic conditions are contributors to bad air quality, man-made pollution is also a huge contributor across the country.India is suffocating through an air pollution emergency. The alarming rise in air pollution levels across India, especially during winter, can be attributed to increase in industrial chimney waste, thermal power stations, burning of farms and vehicular emission. However, the effect of air pollution is different in Eastern India as compared to the rest of the country, where millions still depend on coal-based heating and cooking medium.With multiple cities far from reaching the minimum air quality standards recommended by the World Health Organization, traffic is being forcibly reduced, construction projects are put on hold, in order to combat the crisis. Yet one of the pollution crisis's major contributors, emissions from cooking, has not made headlines as other pollution sources have. Over 85% of Indian rural households use biomass as cooking fuel, according to reports. Biomass burning not only causes indoor pollution but destroys a key resource for soil rejuvenation.According to The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), nearly 40% of India's air pollution comes from domestic fuel burning. For decades, researchers, experts and NGOs have looked for ways of convincing people to switch to more efficient and cost effective cooking methods. When people cook on traditional chulhas, large amounts of toxic smoke and soot escape into the air. These emissions, which can cause cancer, pneumonia, heart disease etc, are a major contributor to outdoor air pollution.In addition to air pollution, burning solid fuels releases emissions of some of the most important contributors to global climate change: carbon dioxide, methane, black carbon, and other short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). Unsustainable wood harvesting also contributes to deforestation, reducing carbon uptake by forests.Earlier this year, an online database established with support from the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, an initiative by the United Nation Foundation, began tracking the impact of household energy consumption on more than 640 districts across India. The data showed that almost 30% of the country's outdoor air pollution is due to household energy combustion. In some districts, household air pollution contributes over half of outdoor air pollution, making it clear that reducing outdoor air pollution requires addressing indoor air pollution as well.The government has announced plans to connect 50 million households below the poverty line to cooking gas by 2019. Thus far, nearly 14 million households have already been given connections to cooking gas. Multiple partners of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves have engaged with the ministry of health and family welfare, in collaboration with UNICEF and WHO, to develop a strategy for including clean cooking as part of India's integrated Action Plan for Prevention of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea.""We know the health impacts of cooking in India, where far too many people still cook with heavily polluting fuels,"" says Damodar Bachani, deputy commissioner at the ministry of health and family welfare, adding, ""The ministry, in collaboration with multiple stakeholders, is helping to mitigate the impact of air pollution on health. One of the proven solutions is increasing the use of safer, cleaner fuels and stoves for cooking.""""Household air pollution from cooking is a leading cause of illness and death in India. Switching millions of people from cooking with solid fuels to consistent use of clean fuels could deliver huge benefits to health and the environment, especially air quality,"" said Radha Muthiah, CEO of GACC./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Homes more polluted than roads: Dr Salvi,"Nagpur: A mosquito repellent coil may give us a feeling of safety from many diseases. Similarly, we derive a feeling of great satisfaction when we light a incense (dhoop) stick while praying to God. But very few of us know that these two are the biggest sources of indoor pollution that can weaken lungs to an extent that may lead to various chronic diseases. /Research has shown that indoor pollution is much more harming and responsible for lung diseases than outdoor pollution.Dr Sundeep Salvi, director of Chest Research Foundation from Pune, said that ""Our homes are the biggest source of air pollution. Inhaling smoke from a mosquito repellent is like inhaling 100 cigarettes. Inhaling smoke from incense sticks is like inhaling ten times more polluted air. And exposure to snake tablet during Diwali is like inhaling three times more polluted air than dhoop stick. Unfortunately, neither people know about the extent of damage that these exposures can lead to in a person nor are the doctors aware of the severity of the impact of these indoor sources of pollution. Also, exposure to biomass-based fuels like a chullah is more dangerous than tobacco.""Dr Salvi was in the city to deliver a talk at NKP Salve Institute of Medical Sciences (NKPSIMS) and Lata Mangeshkar Hospital (LMH) titled 'The air we breathe: It's impact on our health', organized by the department of respiratory medicine at NKPSIMS.A recent study published in Chest Journal in March this year has shown that the closed-door pollution exposes a person to particulate matter of about 2,200 microgram/cubic metre whereas the safety limit is just 50. About 60% of population uses mosquito coils. Also, those who use liquid vaporizers are also exposed to highly toxic gaseous pollutant. Incense sticks of 4cm causes an exposure of 20,000 microgram/cubic metre. A research study in 50 temple priests in Pune showed that about 25% of them suffered from asthma and COPD of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. Another study showed that snake tablet releases 60,000 microgram/cubic metre of pollution. 70% of people in rural areas are exposed to biomass burning through chullah. ""Though the exposure time in all these cases is less, the intensity of exposure is dangerous. It is not surprising that India is considered as one of the most polluted countries in the world and Indians are known for less than 35% of lung capacity than the Caucasian population as they are exposed to both indoor and outdoor forms of severe pollution,"" said Dr Salvi.Dr Anil Sontakke, associate professor, Dr BO Tayde, professor and head of respiratory medicine and Dr Kajal Mitra, NKPSIMS dean, also spoke on the occasion. Dr Rajesh Swarnakar chaired the talk.InfoGhastly after-effects* Exposure to pollution starts in an individual much before birth. Babies born to women with exposure to both indoor and outdoor pollution are smaller in size and weight and are likely to die early* A child exposed to pollution has poor lung growth, weak lungs all his life and its lung function never touches the peak* Respiratory tract infections, asthma, COPD and lung cancer are the most common repercussions of compromised lungs/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"War on pollution begins, but only small battles won","Air pollution was a major talking point the whole of 2016. It kept both the Centre and the Delhi government on their toes, but couldn't move them enough to look for long-term solutions. But there were short-term measures. Such as the odd-even scheme, which was introduced in two phases-from January 1-15, and again from April 15-30. The road rationing, though, got a mixed verdict. /Many environmental experts believed it managed to bring down emissions because of fewer cars on the road and shorter stoppage times; conversely, concerns were raised about the efficacy of the system to curb air pollution when two-wheelers-that accounted for a third of vehicular emissions-were exempted.As November kicked in, both the Delhi government and the Centre had to deploy emergency measures when the capital witnessed the worst smog in its history. On November 5 and 6, the air quality index maxed out with PM 2.5 levels shooting up about 13 times the safe limit. The Delhi government closed down schools for three days, halted all constructions, shut down the Badarpur power plant and even sprinkled water on roads to keep dust down. It acknowledged that it was an emergency.The Centre also acknowledged that bad air posed a serious health threat. The Union health ministry included chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder under the non-communicable disease programme. On SC's prodding, CPCB submitted a ""graded response action plan"", detailing actions to be taken when air quality deteriorates. SC approved it and directed the environment ministry to notify it. CSE's Anumita Roy Chowdhury said, ""Air pollution got more traction this year. Centre should immediately enforce the graded response action plan. This year has been mostly about emergency response to smog. Public transport upgrade has been a non-starter, and there is no move on long-term policies either."" Making Delhi walking and cycling friendly was also more talk than action, as was the Centre's 42-point action plan for the satellite cities. But the Centre notified BS VI norms, while the SC imposed a 1% cess on diesel vehicles beyond 2,000 cc and mandated RFID tags for trucks entering the capital./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution level in Kolkata among country's highest,"KOLKATA: New Delhi may be reeling under severe air pollution, but Kolkata has not only touched the country's capital city but have also surpassed the city quite a few days in terms of air pollution.A joint study by the British Deputy High Commission, UKAID and Kolkata Municipal Corporation that was released last year had found that the city was already the fifth highest among major cities in the country emitting 14.8 million tons of Green House Gas (GHG) and also the second highest contributor in terms of per capita CO2 emission, producing 3.29 tonnes of CO2 per capita. The major sources of air pollution include automobile exhausts which is about 50%, industrial emissions that is almost 48% and the rest 2% from cooking. The findings have been mentioned in details in the book 'Roadmap For Low Carbon And Climate Resilient Kolkata'. It was during the visit of the former UK Prime Minister David Cameron in the city on November 14, 2013 that the UK government had signed a MOU with KMC on low carbon and climate resilient Kolkata.The study also finds that around 70% of the city's 15 million inhabitants suffer from some form of respiratory problems caused by air pollution. /The study specially mentioned that vector borne diseases like malaria and dengue as well as respiratory diseases will rise in the city due to the increasing pollution level. This proved to be true this year, with more than 50 persons have died from dengue and several thousand others affected.The study had come up with proposals as to how to combat and control the increasing air pollution in the city. It had suggested that KMC authorities should work together with the relevant state government departments to establish and enforce auto fuel quality guidelines and emission standards to lower pollution. According to former chief environment law officer Biswajit Mukherjee, a plan should be chalked out to control air pollution. ""There was a plan discussed way back in 2011 to do something to prevent air pollution caused by firecrackers but it did not materialise. The issue should be looked into seriously now,"" he said.State government officials said that the government has taken up a Green Cities mission stressing on developing low carbon urban township areas with special focus on environment. The plan is to stress on using pollution free solar power, battery and electric run vehicles and LED lights to have a low carbon output. State urban development and municipal affairs minister Firhad Hakim recently held a meeting with all municipal bodies of the state by the end of this month to discuss on coming up with measures to control air pollution./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution inside zoo as high as at industrial zones,"Hyderabad: It isn't just the toxic water seeping in from the adjacent Mir Alam Tank that is posing a threat to the lives of animals inside the Nehru Zoological Park. Also making it difficult for them to breathe is the densely-polluted air within the premises that is getting worse every passing day.Air pollution levels inside the Zoo Park are dangerously high, according to data available with the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB). Classified as a 'sensitive' zone with a permissible Air Quality Index (AQI) of under 100, the zoo recorded an AQI of 241 in November last year. According to standards set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), an AQI between 201 and 300 is classified as 'poor' and can cause ""breathing discomfort to people upon prolonged exposure"". The pollution levels are worse than those recorded at some of Hyderabad's industrial zones.Take for instance its fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) level. /While the permissible limit for this is 60 \xB5g/m3, in November, the zoo recorded a PM 2.5 level as high as 103.6 \xB5g/m3. The PM 10 content too stood only second to that recorded at Pashamylaram, an industrial belt in the city outskirts), which was 194 \xB5g/m3. At the zoo, the count was 177 \xB5g/m3. Wildlife activists sound a word of caution. Pointing out how 'Anthracosis', a lung disease and an indicator of air pollution, has claimed many lives at the zoo in the past, Imran Siddique said, ""Anthracosis is seen when there is a high carbon presence in the lungs and many animals at the zoo fell prey to this disease around six years ago. Poor air quality can also cause breathing difficulties in animals and trigger hormonal changes which in turn affects their breeding pattern. It can also cause behavioural problems with animals showing symptoms such as pacing to and fro and drooping heads."" Officials made light of the issue. While blaming the location of the zoo for the rising pollution levels, they said that it wasn't a threat to animals. ""In 2016, five animals died due to water pollution. But no air pollution related illness has been detected among zoo animals so far,"" said a zoo official. According to in-house veterinarian, Abdul Hakim, authorities have been taking all precautions to keep animals safe.

Research links living near major roads to dementia,"NEW DELHI: A massive new study has found correlation between dementia and living near major roads. Over a 10-year period, researchers from Public Health Ontario looked at 6.6 million people staying at different distances from major roads. They found that those staying as close as 50 meters to a major road showed a 7 per cent higher risk of developing dementia, possibly due to a combination of air and noise pollution.The observational study is published in The Lancet. However, it found no link between traffic exposure and Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis.The study estimated that up to one in 10 (7-11%) cases of dementia among those who live within 50 metres of a major road could be attributed to traffic exposure.Previous research has suggested that air pollution and traffic noise may contribute to neurodegeneration, with one study finding that living near a road was associated with reduced white matter and lower cognition. /However, the paper in The Lancet is the first to investigate the link between living close to heavy traffic and the onset of major neurodegenerative diseases.The researchers tracked all adults aged between 20 and 85 living in Ontario, Canada - approximately 6.6 million people - for over a decade from 2001 to 2012. They used postcodes to determine how close people lived to a road and analysed medical records to see if they went on to develop dementia, Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis.Almost all people (95%) in the study lived within one kilometre of a major road and half lived within 200 metres of one. Over the study period, more than 243000 people developed dementia, 31500 people developed Parkinson's disease and 9250 people developed multiple sclerosis.While there was no association between living near a road and Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis, dementia was more common the closer people lived to busy roads. The risk of developing dementia reduced as people lived further away from a main road - with a 7% higher risk in developing dementia among those living within 50 metres, a 4% higher risk at 50-100 metres, a 2% higher risk at 101-200 metres and no increase in risk in those living more than 200 metres away.The researchers also found that long-term exposure to two common pollutants (nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter) was associated with dementia but this did not account for the full effect, meaning other factors are also likely to be involved. These could include other air pollutants or noise from traffic.""Despite the growing impact of these diseases, little is known about their causes and prevention,"" said lead author Dr Hong Chen, Public Health Ontario, Canada. ""Our study suggests that busy roads could be a source of environmental stressors that could give rise to the onset of dementia. Increasing population growth and urbanisation has placed many people close to heavy traffic, and with widespread exposure to traffic and growing rates of dementia, even a modest effect from near-road exposure could pose a large public health burden. More research to understand this link is needed, particularly into the effects of different aspects of traffic, such as air pollutants and noise.""The study estimated air pollution exposure based on postcode, so does not account for each individual's exposure. Because the study is observational it cannot establish causality, but the study was designed to control for socioeconomic status, education levels, BMI and smoking meaning the link is unlikely to be explained by these factors./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Zoo air toxic: No better than at industry zones,"HYDERABAD: It isn't just the toxic water seeping in from the adjacent Mir Alam Tank that is posing a threat to the lives of animals inside the Nehru Zoological Park.Also making it difficult for them to breathe is the densely-polluted air within the premises that is getting worse with every passing day .Air pollution levels inside the Zoo Park are dangerously high, according to data available with the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB). Classified as a `sensitive' zone with a permissible Air Quality Index (AQI) of under 100, the zoo recorded an AQI of 241 in November last year. According to standards set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), an AQI between 201 and 300 is classified as `poor' and can cause ""breathing discomfort to people upon prolonged exposure"".The pollution levels are worse than those recorded at some of Hyderabad's industrial zones. Take for instance the fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) level at the zoo. /While the permissible limit for this is 60 gm3, in November, the zoo recorded a PM 2.5 level as high as 103.6 gm3. The PM 10 content too stood only second to that recorded at Pashamylaram, an industrial belt in the city outskirts), which was 194 gm3. At the zoo, the count was 177 gm3.Wildlife activists sound a word of caution. Pointing out how ` Anthracosis', a lung disease and an indicator of air pollution, has claimed many lives at the zoo in the past, Imran Siddique said, "" Anthracosis is seen when there is a high carbon presence in the lungs and many animals at the zoo fell prey to this disease around six years ago. Poor air quality can also cause breathing difficulties in animals and trigger hormonal changes which in turn affects their breeding pattern. It can also cause behavioural problems with animals showing symptoms such as pacing to and fro and drooping heads.""Officials made light of the issue. While blaming the location of the zoo for the rising pollution levels, they said that it wasn't a threat to animals.""In 2016, five animals died due to water pollution.

Travelling in crowded metro every day? Here's what could be happening to your body,"Daily metro travel is an ordeal of sorts. We hang on to the grab handles, in an endless pursuit of a seat. And as soon as we see a miniscule of the bench peeping through the thighs of two people, we never hesitate to ask, “Can you please shift?” No one minds, or better, no one should mind. We all have the same plight; no one wants to reach office or home with aching backs and legs, a stressed out temperament and a tired mind./Almost 3 million passengers travel every day in Delhi metro. Have you given a thought to this that the daily travel you do mindlessly as part of your routine can be impacting your health in at least three ways?/We talked to three medical experts from Max Hospital, Saket, who helped us understand what these crowded metro rides, can be costing us./The Ortho Damage/While we travel long hours in metro standing our way to our offices, we harm our legs and back the most, says Dr Rajesh Bawari, Sr Consultant, Orthopaedics, Max Hospital, Saket. But the damage happens when we do not mind our postures. Wrong postures can include bending more on one side, carrying heavy bags on our back, bending our necks to fiddle with our phones, wearing heels every day, and so many more that stresses one particular organ of our body more than the others, says Dr Rajesh./Such wrongful habits can manifest themselves in the following ways:/- Pain in neck and back (Cervical Spondylosis)/- Tearing away of spinal disks (Lumbar spondylosis)/- Nerve related issues/- Varicose veins/- Muscle soreness/- Pain in heels and bottom of foot (Plantar fasciitis)/- Painful tender spots on bones/Some simple changes can help lessen the damage. Dr Rajesh says that there are two ways you can spend your time while travelling in metro – one is constructive, the other destructive. While you may or may not get a seat, there are certain things that you should not do and certain things you can do instead that can help you prevent the damage, such as follows:/- While you are standing, do not just stand. Keep moving your feet up and down to avoid pulling blood in your lower legs./- Try standing in a way that you put equal pressure on your big toes, little toes and heels./- Make your travel a double edged sword. Keep tightening your core muscles while you are travelling./- Rest your back against a pillar or metro wall./- Avoid wearing heels everyday. If at all you want to wear them, prefer platform heels./There are certain things that you can do when you reach home. These include:/- Resting your feet on a level above your body, such as keeping them on two pillows while you lie down. This will better the blood circulation in your feet./- Soak your feet in warm water with salt in it./The Mental Fatigue/""People develop a perpetual internal anger on overcrowded trains which they cannot easily displace,"" said Professor Cary Cooper, a psychologist at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology./Overcrowded metros can cause stress much before people reach office and even after they reach their homes back. Travelling in metros can lead to a sense of claustrophobia, especially when you are travelling in underground metro, says Dr Sameer Malhotra, Director, Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences, Max Hospital, Saket. He explains the mental impact of metro travelling that can be put down as two ways:/Drop in serotonin levels: Serotonin is a brain chemical that can have a profound impact on your mood. Dr Sameer says that travelling daily in overcrowded metros can lead to a drop in the level of serotonin in your body making you feel pessimistic, worried and delving into the negative of ‘what ifs’./Cattle truck syndrome: This basically refers to the stress induced by a tiresome daily metro travelling that is crowded like a cattle truck. It can translate into anxiety symptoms that can make one feel that escape from a difficult situation is impossible. Unexpected halting of trains can lead to undue stress particularly when one has deadlines to meet./On the flip side of this, if metro is less crowded, a positive environment can reduce stress levels. But for most office goers, this hardly happens as they travel for the much traditional 9 to 5 shifts./To prevent these, you can do the following:/- Utilize your time well and do what you like. Read a book, watch a video, listen to music, but all this while, make sure that you do not harm your body. Keep your standing posture correct and do not keep your neck bent for too long./- Deep breathe 108 times while you are onboard./- Press these points on your neck and shoulder that help you relieve stress. Read them here ./- De-stress yourself when you reach your office/home by having your cup of coffee or tea or indulging in an activity that relaxes you./The Cardio Risk/Dr Viveka Kumar, Director, Cath Lab, Max Hospital, Saket, says that metro travelling can have both positive as well negative impacts on one’s heart health. On the healthier side is that when one travels by metro, he is exposed to less toxins and does not have to suffer the national capital’s much infamous air pollution./On the negative side of metro travelling impact on heart, Dr Viveka says, are majorly two kinds of risks. These are:/Hypertension: Most office goers are running behindhand almost every day. The unpunctual Delhiites have deadlines to meet and they start swearing against the metro services even for a few minutes’ delay. Such situations lead to stress and in turn can pump up one’s blood pressure./On the flip side, if one has not had a proper meal or is under hydrated before boarding a metro, one’s blood pressure could dip due to blood pooling in one’s legs due to standing. Low blood pressure can make people collapse. Dr Viveka said that he comes across one to two such cases of a collapse in metro every week./Contracting communicable diseases: Dr Viveka said that travelling in metro exposes one to infected droplets of bacteria that other people can be releasing and can lead to air borne diseases such as chest infections and tuberculosis. You also may become more prone to seasonal allergies, common cold and cough and viral fever./To prevent these, Dr Viveka gives the following advices:/- Before boarding a metro, make sure that you are well hydrated and not on an empty stomach./- Wash your hands and face every time you de-board a metro. Make it the first thing you do when you reach your office or home./- If you cannot wash them immediately, use sanitizers for your hands./- Do not repeat the clothes you wear once during a metro ride without washing them./- Take a bath in the evening when you reach back home after a day spent in a crowded metro./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"As mercury dips after rain, farmers cheer","RUDRAPUR: Mercury dipped 3-4 degrees Celsius after rain lashed Udham Singh Nagar district Saturday morning, bringing cheers to the farmers sowing Rabi crop. Rain started lashing the district, which otherwise remained dry thus far, early in the morning, and by evening, the meteorological department recoded a rainfall of 8.2 mm and wind speed of 10 kmph./This brought the maximum temperature down by 3 degrees, which settled at 14; and the minimum tumbled to 6 degrees, four notches down. The trend is likely to continue for the next three days, as the Met has predicted rain for the next 24 hours and more./According to Met, today’s rain was triggered by two successive western disturbances affecting Jammu and Kashmir, which have also induced a cyclonic circulation over northern India and is moving eastwards gradually. As a result of disturbances, intermittent rains have lashed the plains as well./Weather expert Anil Hafiz told TOI, “The rain will continue for the next 24 hours, leading to drop in day temperature on Sunday. Thereafter, the rain will cease as the disturbances will move away from the region and will pave way to cold northwesterly wind to sweep Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and hilly areas of Uttarakhand that received heavy snow. As a result, both day and night temperatures will start falling significantly after January 9.”/“We can expect mercury to be lowest between January 10 and 12 degrees, while the night temperature may settle below 5,” said Hafiz, adding that terai is likely to reel under severe winter chill next week, which could be marked as the coldest period of this winter./Normally, the region receives at least 2-3 rain spells between November and December./District agriculture officer (DAO) P K Singh said, “The rainfall will boost the rabi crop (also known as winter crops), which include wheat, barley, mustard, sesame and peas. Water-intensive sugarcane, the main cash crop in the district, which were sown in December, are at present in vegetative or pre-flowering stage. Watering at this point of time is very good for them, particularly drizzling that let soil to absorb maximum water,” said Singh, adding that the rain is good for those farmers who do not have irrigation facilities./Dr M K Tiwari, senior physician at the district hospital, however, said, “The rain will drastically reduce diseases like flu, viral infections, nasal and throat allergies, dry cough and skin allergies. Many diseases will disappear with the first rainfall of the winter. However, after the rain, the mercury will go down, and thus, I will suggest mothers to keep their kids, especially newborn, warm and to make proper heating arrangements in their rooms.”/The dry spell had led to increase in air pollution, causing chest and throat infections; however, the rain would wash away dust particles and make the weather pleasant, he added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"You aren't alone Delhi, all 22 NCR districts are choking","NEW DELHI: New air pollution data derived from satellite imagery suggests that the severe levels of particulate matter (PM2.5, or respirable pollutants) seen in Delhi are also found throughout the 22 districts of the National Capital Region (NCR). These findings raise alarm about potentially serious adverse effects on the health and livelihoods of NCR residents outside of Delhi and underline the importance of a coordinated response to pollution across NCR. Till now the focus has been on the pernicious effects of pollution in the major urban centres, but the new data will help shine the light on exposure to contaminated air in rural areas and smaller cities. For instance, Rewari in Haryana, like other relatively sparse NCR districts far from Delhi, recorded annual PM2.5 levels several times higher than the World Health Organization standard of 10 micrograms per cubic metre between 1998 and 2014. And between 1998 and 2014, NCR districts in Uttar Pradesh to the southeast of Delhi - Bulandshahr, Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad - registered pollution levels comparable to or even higher than in the national capital. Rural populations tend to be more vulnerable to the effects of air pollution on their health and livelihoods since most residents work outdoors, where pollution levels are systematically higher than those indoors. /Rural populations also have comparably poorer health and poorer access to health care than their urban counterparts, making them more likely to get sick from pollution exposure and less likely to get better. Moreover, air pollutants associated with particulate matter have been show to harm crops and reduce agricultural yields, meaning that air pollution could contribute to deepening poverty. Until now, analyses of air pollution in NCR have relied primarily on a handful of permanent ground monitors run by the Central Pollution Control Board, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee and the US embassy, all located in or just outside the capital. The satellite data, in contrast, measure pollution levels for every square kilometre across India. The new data were made available by Aaron van Donkelaar, an atmospheric scientist from Dalhousie University, and coauthors, who produced the estimates based on observations from NASA satellites. The satellite imagery provides a measurement called aerosol optical depth (AOD), which is the degree to which aerosols, or particles in the air, prevent transmission of light in an area and is considered a proxy for air quality. Health ministry deputy commissioner Dr Damodar Bachani acknowledged the widespread impact of air pollution in rural areas. ""I have seen satellite images which show even rural areas are equally badly affected. The sources of air pollution may be different in rural areas but you cannot isolate urban air from rural air. The impact of air pollution also strongly dependent on wind direction because of which many rural areas are affected when wind brings pollution from other polluted areas."" While we dont know for sure what is causing severe air pollution in these districts of Uttar Pradesh, the sources identified by various research organisations include industries, brick kilns, vehicles, crop fires, waste burning and others. We also know that there are thermal power plants to the east of Delhi and the brick kilns are primarily to the northeast. The NCR's counter magnet areas, or towns and cities that act as alternatives to Delhi as centres of growth and attract migrants, among them Kanpur, Bareilly and Patiala, often suffer bad air, with pollution ranging from poor to severe. Despite this, the National Capital Region Planning Board's Regional Plan 2021 has no mechanism to address air pollution. It only states, ""The pollution impacts have to be identified through appropriate field research studies so that the levels and types of industrialisation can be established for different sub-regions."" Proper enforcement of the December 2, 2016, order of the Supreme Court on the MC Mehta petition against air pollution could reverse the trend. The court directed the notification and implementation of a graded response action plan for the entire NCR. Such a plan envisages action to reduce emissions from various sources depending on the air quality status. For example, when air quality is rated as 'emergency' (PM 2.5 levels higher than 300 micrograms per cubic metre persisting for 48 hours), the entry of trucks into Delhi, other than for essential commodities, is be stopped, vehicles on roads lowered through the odd-even scheme and other steps taken, like banning waste burning, closing brick kilns and controlling emissions from industrial units and hot mix plants. ""It has to be seen how stringently this graded response action plan is enforced in the NCR,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of Centre for Science and Environment's clean-air campaign. ""To check industrial pollution, it's important to stop the use of polluting fuels like furnace oil and pet coke, transition to modern technology for brick kilns, change thermal power plants in Dadri and Jhajjar to natural gas and upgrade emission norms for commercial vehicles to Bharat Stage 4 at the earliest."" The union health ministry has recently included chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) - a health condition closely associated with exposure to polluted air - in its non-communicable diseases programme. As Dr Bachani pointed out, ""We know of pollution's association with chronic respiratory diseases, some cancers, heart ailments, low birth weight of new-borns, early onset of cataract and other effects."" On December 20 last year, the NCR Planning Board reviewed the measures being taken by the four member states and Punjab to contain air pollution in the capital and has directed them to submit detailed action plans.(Kevin Rowe is a PhD student at Harvard University, a PhD Student Affiliate of Evidence for Policy Design, and a Vicki Norberg-Bohm Fellow.)/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Demonetisation gives marathon a run for its money in Mumbai,"It was an adrenaline-packed Sunday morning, as the city came out on the streets for one of the most awaited sporting extravaganzas - the Mumbai Marathon. The super-charged event saw people of all ages in jerseys, with placards and banners for a cause, and above all, showing off the sporting spirit that Mumbai is so known for. Those who ran were cheered by the crowds with music, whistles, a dhol-taasha and some bhangra, too!/ The early start saw the full marathon (42 km) being flagged off from CST and the 21 km half marathon, from Worli Seaface. And finally, all eyes were on the Dream Run, which had a mixed crowd of corporates, NGOs and society. Nothing seemed to hold back the participants - some ran with kids in tow, senior war veterans with a disability showed that nothing is impossible if you have the willpower to do it, and for yet others, it was simply about being there and advocating a cause close to their hearts. You had folks running for AIDS awareness, Parkinson's disease, a cleaner Mumbai, reducing air pollution, education for girls, helping street children and the cause of farmers. Given the recent economic undercurrent, there was also an 'ATM'; as someone remarked, 'it's running this time!' Unmissable was the larger-than-life serpent slithering its way onto the track, in favour of men's rights. Pushing, laughing and making their way with other runners were surgeons in their attire, 'bees' and Yamraj, too!

"Dipping temperature, high humidity levels worsening air pollution in Mumbai","MUMBAI: As minimum temperatures dipped and humidity levels continued to be high, pollution levels in the city breached the 'very poor' quality mark. On Tuesday, the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 307 on Tuesday. /An AQI between 301 and 400 is considered 'very poor', which, according to SAFAR, means people with heart or lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart disease or ischemic heart disease should avoid prolonged or heavy exertion. On Monday, the AQI recorded was 250.Researchers from SAFAR said the increase in pollution levels could be attributed to winter conditions and high moisture levels. ""Mumbai's humidity levels have remained high for the past few days and maximum temperatures are below normal, hence, the pollutants get trapped, making the air heavy. Low wind speeds have also not allowed the pollutants to disperse quickly,"" said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR.Among the 10 locations monitored by SAFAR, six recorded an AQI in the 'very poor' category and four remained in 'poor' category on Tuesday. Mazgaon was the most polluted at 395 and Worli was least polluted at 220.On Tuesday, the minimum temperatures at Santacruz and Colaba were 16.6 and 20 degrees Celsius respectively, lower compared to Monday. The maximum temperatures were below normal with Santacruz and Colaba recording 29.7 and 28 degrees Celsius respectively-1.5 and 0.7 degrees below normal. The AQI is expected to improve to 302 on Wednesday, but it will still be in 'very poor' category./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Not from a minister: Cow's urine can help clean air,"CHENNAI: The recent claim by a Union minister that cows inhale and exhale oxygen and that their dung can neutralise radioactive elements may have no scientific backing, but a city-based doctor says cow's urine can clean air pollution.It can trap toxic carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and particulate matter from clouds of exhaust fumes to a great extent, says Dr K Jagadeesan, founder and chief surgeon of KJ Hospital.A laboratory experiment with cow urine and thick white smoke showed it could remove carbon monoxide up to 95% and carbon dioxide up to 78%, said Dr Jagadeesan. It can also trap particulate matter up to 26%, he said.""The ammonia in cow urine has the capacity to absorb toxic elements from smoke. The enzymes in the urine dissolve the urea and it is converted into ammonia,"" he said.Inspired by Hindu priests who sprinkle cow's urine before starting a 'sacred fire' and sit comfortably in front for hours, Jagadeesan used a smoke generator to get thick white fumes from burning coconut fibre. /A reservoir connected to a jar containing two litres of cow's urine with a 6mm polythene tube. One end of another tube is inserted into the jar with the open end used to let smoke out. Both tubes in the jar are connected to a 15cm tube twisted into a coil with multiple perforations and its terminal end closed.""The generator was delivering smoke that was colourless and odourless. We collected the outcoming air and sent it to an NABL accredited lab to test for various parameters,"" Dr Jagadeesan said. ""The quantity of smoke, volume of urine and the duration it takes have a direct linear relationship.""Dr Jagadeesan is now working with IIT-M researchers to use enzymes from cow urine and develop a dry technology to clean air on a large scale. Shiva Nagendra, associate professor of IIT-M's environmental and water resources engineering division who has been working on developing air purifiers, said the acidic nature of cow urine may have the capacity to absorb toxic elements in the air, but it is still under research./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

More stubble burning in winter adds to fog,"Fine particles emitted by burning of crop residue and garbage play a major role in increasing density and duration of fog in north India, according to recent research from Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur.Looking at several years of data on air pollution and fog in Kanpur, scientists found that winters with dramatically higher levels of fine particulate matter experienced more frequent incidents of fog. These fog spells also lasted longer.For instance, in the winter of 2012-13, when average levels of PM1 hit 135ug/m3, there were 21 fog events lasting an average of 8.8 hours. The next year, when PM1 levels were lower with average around 94 ug/m3, there were only 6 fog events lasting an average of 4.8 hours.A separate analysis of fog water samples, by professor S N Tripathi and PhD researcher Abhishek Chakraborty, points to a possible explanation. /Fog is formed when moisture condenses around particles in the air. At high levels, fine particulates lead to the formation of lots of small fog droplets. Small droplets persist in the air for longer, said Tripathi, and also scatter light more efficiently, leading to greater declines in visibility.By contrast, larger droplets result in fog that is less dense and dissipates faster. Fog in the US and Europe tend to be dominated by large droplets, Chakraborty said.While industrial emissions also produce fine particulates, the studies found that particulates from biomass burning dominated high pollution days in Kanpur. Big sources of biomass burning include local garbage burning as well as crop residue fires in Punjab and Haryana in pre-winter months.Small biomass particulates are also hygroscopic or water-friendly, and thus prone to forming fog droplets, said Tripathi. These droplets get processed further during the fog and produce more particulates that are also water magnets. In effect, ""biomass burning may be facilitating formation of fog and fog in turn is processing those particulates to make them more fog-friendly,"" Tripathi said.Another cycle is at play, notes Chakraborty. As fog increases, the temperature drops, and poor people burn more trash or wood to stay warm. Those fires then emit particulates that could trigger the next local haze or fog.Fine polluted droplets are also more toxic to human health, the scientists noted. They are more concentrated and, because of their small size, enter lungs easily.While studies have previously linked the increasing incidence of winter fog in north India to rising pollution levels in the region, IIT Kanpur's ongoing research highlights the role played by the size and type of particulate matter. ""Once meteorological conditions for fog are met-low temperature, moderate wind, calm conditions and so on-then the density of fog and its persistence seems to depend on the amount of and chemical nature of the particulate matter,"" said Tripathi./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Rain relief gone, Gurugram second worst-polluted city","GURUGRAM: If rain gods had infused a fresh lease of life into the atmosphere by rinsing off pollutants on Thursday, by Sunday, diesel-run smoke-belching 'demons' had robbed the city of the clean air, leaving residents gasping.With air quality plunging back to 'poor' level, Gurgaon was adjudged the second most-polluted among 27 cities listed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Sunday. Gaya was the most polluted city in the country for the day.The city's air quality index (AQI) was reported to be 'poor' at 247, around 31% higher than Delhi's 'Moderate' AQI of 188. Going by the weather forecast, the situation is likely to get worse in the coming days of the week.The minimum temperature on Sunday remained 9 degrese Celsius while the maximum temperature was 21 degrees Celsius. ""While the maximum temperature is expected to go up to 25\xB0C from the current 20-21\xB0C, we're expecting more cloudy and foggy days this week. /There is no further forecast of rain either,"" said a Met official.The city recorded the highest concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 at 109.56\xB5g/m\xB3 on Sunday, up from nearly 50\xB5g/m\xB3 on Thursday and Friday. According to WHO, 60\xB5g/m\xB3 is the safe level for PM2.5.Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) blamed the city's proximity to multiple national and state highways for the poor air quality. ""In the NCR region, Gurgaon is perhaps the only city which is situated near a national highway - NH-8, as well as many state highways. The huge rush of heavy vehicles makes the city more polluted. Besides, diesel autos are a major source of air pollution. I don't see any other factor here for making the city's air quality worse than that of Delhi,"" said an official of HSPCB.Experts said rise in fog would add to the pollution in the days to come. ""Increase in fog means particulate matter will remain trapped in the lower atmosphere, leading to a rise in air pollution. If there is prediction of foggy days ahead, air pollution is definitely going to go up,"" said Sudhir Pandey, a former professor of environmental sciences at Delhi University./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Fire raging in Tamil Nadu industrial unit,"VELLORE: A fire broke out at the processing unit of a company in Phase III of SIPCOT in Ranipet in the early hours of Monday. The fire that was noticed at 5.15am was raging still in the afternoon.The fire broke out in the processing unit of Gujarat Enviro Protection and Infrastructure Limited. It spread fast and engulfed the raw materials and chemicals stocked in the processing unit.Fire and rescue services personnel from Ranipet and surrounding areas had been fighting for more than nine hours to bring the blaze under control. /""We have been fighting for over several hours to contain it from spreading to neighbouring units. It will subside only after the raw waste burn out,"" a fire brigade said.Six fire tenders were engaged in containing the fire. District collector S A Raman, who inspected the unit, said, ""I have instructed the local body to supply water in tankers to help the fire brigades to contain the fire. The civic body is doing so. Since the unit used to stock chemical waste, the fire brigades are using sand to contain the residual fire.""Billowing smoke caused breathing difficulty to people in the area. The collector said the pollution control board had been instructed to conduct an air pollution test.The unit is manufacturing alternative fuel for cement factories by converting waste from paint and solvent. Its licence -- issued on February 28, 2013 -- is valid till February 28, 2018. ""We have been running the unit after getting proper permission from the pollution control board. We have also following all safety norms. We don't know the cause for the fire accident,"" said an administrative staff of the company. Damage to the property was yet to be ascertained.Except a security guard, there were no other employees when the fire broke out. ""If there had been employees, they would have contained the fire,"" he said. However, he declined to reveal the names and quantity of chemicals stocked in the unit.According to the details found in the notice board of the company, it has been handling chemicals such as ferrous sulphate, hydrated lime, poly aluminum chloride, polyelectrolyte and diesel. The company has a capacity of manufacturing 50 metric tonne of alternative fuel per day.Officials from revenue and pollution control board rushed to the unit and conducted an inquiry. A team from the National Disaster Response Force also reached the spot and reviewed the situation./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"When dengue hit our area, no leader came to visit us","LUCKNOW: Unanimous distrust of government run hospitals, unaffordable private care and mismanagement of major disease outbreaks like dengue and chikungunya are just a few health-related concerns that have irked residents of Lucknow east constituency. They haven't seen or known their MLA Gopalji Tandon (BJP) after elections. Residents say it was only Swaroop Kumari Bakshi--she won the seat from 1974-1985 for four terms-who traversed the roads on foot. /A number of demands came to the fore when TOI spoke to residents. These included uplift of government health care facilities to instil people's trust in them, revision of rates for health care in government hospitals to include upper middle class and subsidised treatment and regulation in private set-ups for affordable care and health insurance schemes from the government to involve all strata of society.INDIRANAGAR| Garbage dumped in lanes attract disease-causing flies and mosquitoes, residents say. People also fear visiting government hospitals because of poor sanitation. ""There is just so much filth around that the area is a breeding ground for diseases. Even during dengue outbreak, it was only after public protests that some attention was paid, albeit temporarily,"" said Archana Mehrotra, resident of A block.Rajshree, a resident of Bhootnath, said, ""Not just dengue, seasonal fevers and viral infections are common. We have been asking public representatives for health camps, but to no avail."" Jai Singh, a resident of C block, said since private health care is costly, they had given a memorandum to candidates who came during 2012 elections to provide subsidised care to middle class in government hospitals. ""All promised us the same but nothing happened.""NEW HYDERABAD-NISHATGANJ| ""There is a Phool Park here but it doesn't even have weeds, only stones and heaps of garbage.This is the case with almost all the parks,"" pointed out KP Srivastava of New Hyderabad. ""Only Swaroop Kumari Bakshi made regular visits. Even her successor Vidya Sagar Gupta, MLA for three terms, did no footwork for us,"" he added.Residents said their demand for proper upkeep of parks has fallen on deaf ears for years. Traffic in narrow lanes causes both noise and air pollution leading to health hazards. There is no information disseminated by the health department.GOMTINAGAR| While a large number of dengue cases were reported from and around Gomtinagar, residents say there was no awareness drive and anti-larva fogging was done only around VIP homes.""There was a lot of panic around dengue outbreak in 2016 and government hospitals were not the first option for people. Private hospitals only encashed the situation and looted us,"" said RP Dubey who lives in Viram Khand. No major political party made dengue an issue, nor did any leader come to visit, said Shashikant Singh, another resident. While the area has some green cover in the form of Janeshwar Mishra Park and Lohia Park, scarcity of society parks is a concern./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"No ban on polluting fuels in NCR, SC raps Centre","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court slammed the Centre on Monday for not taking any decision to ban polluting fuels like furnace oil and pet coke in the NCR and directed it to chalk out a comprehensive plan in a month in consultation with governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana to tackle air pollution in the capital.Pointing out that an estimated eight people die every day in the capital due to pollution-related diseases, a bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Prafulla C Pant said the governments should take immediate steps to deal with the situation. It asked the Centre to hold consultations with the parties concerned to ban the polluting fuels used by industries and explore alternatives. The bench said sulphur content in furnace oil and pet coke is too high to be allowed to be used as fuel.As the pollution level in Delhi has reached alarming levels, the Environment Pollution Control and Prevention Authority (EPCA) has recommended to the Supreme Court to ban the polluting fuels. /Although the Delhi Pollution Control Committee had declared then unacceptable fuel in the capital way back in 1996, they are not banned outside Delhi borders and are being increasingly used by industries in the NCR, contributing to the pollution levels in the city.Advocate Aprajita Singh, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, told the bench that quality of fuel played a critical role in quantum of pollution generated and sulphur level in furnace oil and pet coke was multiple times higher than in other acceptable fuels.""Samples of pet coke used in NCR contains sulphur level between 69,000 ppm to 74,000 ppm and the level of sulphur in furnace oil is between 15,000 to 20,000 ppm. It is higher in comparison to petrol/diesel with 50 ppm,"" she said.The court asked Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar to ask the Centre to take a call on banning these fuels. It also suggested that a comprehensive plan should be prepared to control pollution level in the city as various authorities were having different plans and there was lack of a holistic approach. It asked EPCA, Central Pollution Control Board, the ministry of environment and forests, Delhi and its neighbouring states to have a joint meeting to chalk out an acceptable comprehensive plan. Pleading for blanket ban on polluting fuels, EPCA in its recommendation to SC said furnace oil, being the last grade produced by refineries is extremely polluting and pet coke, a by-product, is even more polluting.""There is no doubt that the use of such high sulphur fuel is greatly contributing to pollution in the region ... The use of furnace oil and pet coke should be strictly banned in NCR. Pet coke will be allowed only in cement plants, where combustion and emissions are controlled. However, if any cement plant requires the use of pet coke, it will have to seek permission from CPCB and EPCA,"" it said.EPCA said its investigation had revealed that large quantities of furnace oil are sold in Delhi and NCR by oil companies and the sale has gone up this year with 30,000 metric tonnes being sold every month./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Lucknow's biggest scrap dump near my home',"LUCKNOW: Localities of Lucknow (north) are pockets of infectious diseases. After delimitation, voters thought they would be saved from the perils of fever and diarrhoea outbreaks in slum-turned-unorganised hamlets in the vicinity once planned colonies like Keshavnagar and Priyadrashani Colony came up.But neither public representatives nor authoities have been able to recognise a possible source of infection--the city's biggest scrap colony that has come up along Priyadarshni Colony. The scrap dealers' colony sprawls over an estimated area of 8,000 square feet and is full of discarded mugs, tubs, bottles, tyres and boxes--dengue mosquito's favourite breeding ground. /""No matter how much you tell these scrap dealers about the risk of disease here, they do not bother,"" said Preeti Shah, a social worker who lives in the area.Residents have taken their problems to the sitting MLA.""We failed to evoke any response from him,"" said Preeti who works also in the area of health awareness. ""The problem is not restricted to this area alone, many adjoining localities are bound to bear the brunt,"" said Dr AK Shukla.In Jankipuram, it is traffic jams that make people sick. ""Traffic jams are an everyday thing in the area.While noise causes headache, irratability and sleep disturbances, air pollution makes it worse for those with lung issues,"" said Prof Manoj Dixit of Lucknow University. This is in addition to the risk of seasonal infections caused by waterlogged roads and poor garbage management.

"India reported 1.1 million deaths due to air pollution in 2015, says a global study","NEW DELHI: The government here may be in denial mode on linking premature deaths to air pollution, but a new study on global air pollution by the US-based institutes claims that the India's worsening air pollution caused some 1.1 million premature deaths in 2015 and the country now ""rivals China for among the highest air pollution health burdens in the world.""The special report on 'global exposure to air pollution and its disease burden', released on Tuesday, noted that the number of premature deaths in China caused by dangerous fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, has stabilised in recent years but has risen sharply in India. It also said that both the countries together were responsible for over half of the total global attributable deaths while India had registered an alarming increase of nearly 50% in premature deaths from particulate matter between 1990 and 2015.Besides data analysis on air pollution, the report also carries an interactive website on the issue highlighting that 92% of the world's population lives in the areas with unhealthy air.""We are seeing increasing air pollution problems worldwide, and this new report and website details why that air pollution is a major contributor to early death,"" said Dan Greenbaum, President of the Health Effects Institute (HEI), the global research institute that designed and implemented the study. /He said, ""The trends we report show that we have seen progress in some parts of the world - but serious challenges remain.""The State of Global Air 2017 is the first of a new series of annual reports and accompanying interactive website, designed and implemented by the Health Effects Institute in cooperation with the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington and the University of British Columbia. The IHME is an independent population health research center that publishes the annual Global Burden of Diseases -- a systematic scientific effort to quantify the magnitude of health loss from all major diseases, injuries, and risk factors in populations across the world. Its results are published every year in The Lancet medical journal. ""Although there are many parts of the world where air pollution has grown worse, there has also been improvement in the US and Europe. The US Clean Air Act and actions by the European Commission have made substantial progress in reducing people exposed to PM pollution since 1990,"" said a statement issued by the HEI. Referring to the study, it said, ""The US has experienced a reduction of about 27% in average annual population exposures to fine particulate matter with smaller declines in Europe. Yet some 88,000 Americans and 258,000 Europeans still face increased risks of dying early due to PM levels today"". The report noted that the highest concentrations of combustion-related fine particulate matter were in South and Southeast Asia, China and Central and Western Sub-Saharan Africa in 2015 where household solid fuel use, coal-fired power plants, transportation, and open burning of agricultural and other wastes were among the most important contributors to outdoor air pollution. ""The Global Burden of Disease leads a growing worldwide consensus - among the WHO, World Bank, International Energy Agency and others - that air pollution poses a major global public health challenges,"" said Bob O'Keefe, Vice President of HEI and Chair of Clean Air Asia. He said, ""Nowhere is that risk more evident than in the rapidly growing economies of Asia.""The study finds that increasing exposure and a growing and aging population have meant that India now rivals China for among the highest air pollution health burdens in the world, with both countries facing some 1.1 million early deaths from air pollution in 2015.It said the long-term exposure to fine particulate matter -- the most significant element of air pollution -- contributed to 4.2 million premature deaths and to a loss of 103 million healthy years of life in 2015, making air pollution the 5th highest cause of death among all health risks, including smoking, diet, and high blood pressure.India has, however, always been sceptical of such reports. Though the government here did never deny the negative impact of air pollution on human healths, it preferred not to speak about numbers. Even recently during Budget session of the Parliament, the government had on February 6 said that there was no conclusive data to link deaths exclusively with air pollution. It, however, admitted that the air pollution could be one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and diseases.""There is no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct co-relationship of death exclusively with air pollution. Health effects of air pollution are synergistic manifestation of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity etc. of the individuals,"" said the country's environment minister Anil Madhav Dave.Dave, in his written response to a Parliament question in Rajya Sabha, had said, ""Air pollution could be one of the triggering factors for respiratory associated ailments and diseases.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
India tops list of countries in ozone pollution deaths,"India has been in denial mode on linking premature deaths to air pollution in the absence of conclusive data, but a new comprehensive global report by two US-based institutes may now trigger a rethink. The report claims the country's worsening air pollution caused some 1.1 million premature deaths in 2015 and it now rivals China in having among the highest air pollution health burdens in the world.The State of Global Air 2017 report, released in Boston on Tuesday, claims long term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) -the most significant element of air pollution -contributed to 4.2 million premature deaths in the world in 2015 where both India and China together were responsible for over half of the total global deaths. Though the report sounds alarm bells for entire Asia, it paints a particularly grim picture for India where the rate of increase of premature deaths due to air pollution is even higher than in China. /It noted that while the early deaths related to PM2.5 in China has increased by 17.22% since 1990, it has increased by 48% in India.Ozone-related early deaths in India are, in fact, 33% higher than those recorded for China. India's deepening pollution problem, which hit home with a vengeance after Diwali last year as Delhi and NCR woke up enveloped in smog that refused to lift for days, has a death toll second only to China's, and together the two nations account for over half the world's deaths from pollution.According to the State of Global Air 2017 report, released in Boston on Tuesday , as many as 2.54 lakh deaths occurred in 2015 on account of exposure to ozone and its impact on chronic lung disease.India accounts for the highest number of premature deaths due to ozone pollution, its toll 13 times higher than Bangladesh's, and 21 times higher than Pakistan's.An interactive website on the report also highlights that 92% of the world's population lives in areas with unhealthy air. ""We are seeing increasing air pollution problems worldwide, and this new report and website details why that air pollution is a major contributor to early death,"" said Dan Greenbaum, president of the Health Effects Institute (HEI), the research institute that designed and carried out the study . He said, ""The trends we report show that we have seen progress in some parts of the world, but serious challenges remain"".The report was prepared by HEI in cooperation with the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington and the University of British Columbia. Involving more than 2,000 researchers, the report factored in the role of an extensive set of behavioural, dietary and environmental risk factors for more than 300 diseases in 195 countries from 1990 onwards.Referring to the findings of the report, Anumita Roychowdhury of the Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""India can't afford to remain complacent or in denial. With so many people dying early and falling ill... due to particulate and ozone pollution, it is a state of health emergency. This demands nationwide intervention to ensure stringent mitigation and a road map to meet clean air standards""./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Centre plays down global alarm on India pollution,"NEW DELHI: The Union government expressed concern on Friday over a recent global report attributing over a million deaths in the country in 2015 to air pollution.However, it adhered to its stated position that though a serious issue, pollution was not the only reason that led to so many deaths. Playing down the findings of the 'State of Global Air 2017', Union environment minister Anil Madhav Dave said India did not work on reports from outside, and preferred to rely on research done within the country.""India trusts its own reports. /We take decisions based on our own reports... We will stress on research done by Indian institutions,"" Dave added. Admitting that air pollution was a serious issue that affected human health, he later told TOI that the country had a very clear position on this and that's why the government had been taking multiple measures to fight the menace. ""As I said in Parliament, I would like to repeat that the air pollution could be one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and diseases,"" he said. On February 6, Dave had told Parliament, ""There is no conclusive data available in the country to establish a direct co-relationship of death exclusively with air pollution. Health effects of air pollution are a synergistic manifestation of factors such as food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity etc of individuals"".Union science minister Harsh Vardhan agreed with Dave, but asserted that any report coming from bodies like the World Health Organisation should be taken ""seriously""./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
