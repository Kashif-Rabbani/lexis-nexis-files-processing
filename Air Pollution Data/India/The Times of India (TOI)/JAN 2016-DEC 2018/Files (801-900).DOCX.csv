'AQI likely to get better after 48 hours',"PATNA: The state capital witnessed a sharp rise in the air pollution level with a surge in the Air Quality Index (AQI) on Diwali on Wednesday.According to Sameer app of the Central Pollution Control Board (CBPCB), the AQI increased from 373 at 4pm on Wednesday to 420 at 8am on Thursday, which falls under the 'severe' category. It can badly affect healthy people and those with existing diseases.The CPCB stated that Patna's AQI was 334 on the eve of Diwali on Tuesday. The worsening of air quality began on Wednesday with large-scale bursting of firecrackers and other meteorological conditions.Despite the Supreme Court's restrictions on bursting of crackers from 8pm to 10pm this Diwali, the AQI was 373 at 4pm on Wednesday and 388 at 11pm, an hour after the end of the two-hour window.Experts claimed that meteorological factors such as drop in temperature, increase in moisture and decline in wind speed also formed favourable conditions for trapping of pollutants in Patna's air.""The temperature dropped to 17 degrees C at 11pm on Wednesday, while the humidity was 84% that led to an increase in moisture and trapping of pollutants. /The wind, which was blowing at a speed of 8km per hour on Tuesday became calm. These factors made the dispersal of pollutants more difficult,"" said a duty officer at the Patna Meteorological Centre.He added, ""Meteorological factors played a secondary role in Patna's air pollution on Diwali. The primary role was played by large-scale bursting of firecrackers.""Bihar State Pollution Control Board's senior scientist S N Jaiswal claimed, ""As per our assessment, the concentration of pollutants will take at least 48 hours to disperse.""

Post-Diwali pollution level increases in the Bhubaneswar,"BHUBANESWAR: Air pollution levels in the capital city of Bhubaneswar dropped drastically after Wednesday's Diwali celebrations as the time restrictions imposed by the Supreme Court on bursting of crackers went for a toss.TRACK THE AIR POLLUTION IN YOUR CITYAccording to Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city recorded at several locations in the city has increased to 'hazardous' levels after people started bursting crackers. The AQI is calculated for four major air pollutants including ground level ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide.At master Canteen square the AQI recorded was 54 at 10 am on Wednesday morning at Master Canteen Square. But the air quality started deteriorating rapidly and between 8 pm to 9 pm it reached 369 and at 10 pm it was 361. On Thursday 6 am it was remained as high as 329.Similarly the highest AQI recorded between 8 pm to 9 pm at major locations in the city like 343 at Infocity area, 352 at DAV, Unit-VIII area, 364 at Saheed Nagar and 353 at KIIT square.""The AQI score recorded within 0 to 50 is good, 50-100 is moderate, 100-200 is unhealthy, above 200 is very unhealthy and once it crosses 300 score it is hazardous. /So from this it is easily estimated how bad the quality of Bhubaneswar air was during and after Diwali,"" said noted environmentalist S N Patro.He said, the high levels of AQI suggests that the PM10 (particle matter) and PM 2.5 amount is very high in the air causing serious health hazards. ""PM2.5 are very fine particles that get deep into lungs and some may even get into the bloodstream. Exposure to these particles can affect a person's lungs and heart and cause many non-communicable diseases like cancer. Coarse particles (PM10-2.5) are of less concern, although they can irritate a person's eyes, nose, and throat,"" Patro added.Though the police made some crack down at people violating the time restriction but it had little impact on pollution levels.The police also failed to check noise pollution or restrict bursting of high sounding crackers, but they claimed the 10 pm deadline of bursting crackers was strictly maintained. Noise levels in the city got seriously disturbed following the explosion of ear-splitting crackers, according to sources in the Odisha State Pollution Control Board.Against the standard limit of 55 decibel (dB) in residential areas, the noise level hovered over the 85 mark in day time and nearly 95 in the night on Wednesday.

"Delhi air quality turns foul, again, post Diwali revelries as SC firecrackers ban goes up in smoke","NEW DELHI: Delhi and NCR, yet again, saw its air quality nosedive on Diwali, no thanks to people bursting crackers and violating a Supreme Court order allowing on green crackers to check pollution levels and was fouler than last year.Delhi's air quality on Wednesday, Diwali day, oscillated between ""poor"" and ""very poor"" categories as authorities warned of severe deterioration of air quality even if ""partial toxic crackers"" are burned compared to last year. On Thursday morning, most air quality monitoring stations across the city had ""very poor"" air quality.Track the pollution level in your cityOn Wednesday, 11 areas of Delhi recorded ""very poor"" air quality while 24 areas recorded ""poor"" air quality, according to the CPCB data. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"".However, as Diwali evening came and despite the Supreme Court ban people all over Delhi-NCR came out and burst crackers, even though in not as large volumes as previous years, the air quality nosedived fast.Jahangirpuri, which is arguably one of the most polluted spots in Delhi, had the highest PM10 reading at 4,499 microgram per cubic metre, according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee real-time monitoring at 11pm and is the highest across DPCC stations on Diwali night. /Wazirpur, at 1am, saw PM2.5, the finer particulate matter, touching an astronomic high of 4,659 microgram per cubic metre, which is the highest across all DPCC stations this Diwali. The permissible limit of PM10 and PM2.5 are 100 and 60 microgram per cubic metre. Other monitoring stations which showed huge spike in pollution levels were Dwarka, Okhla and Aurobindo Marg, among others.Last year, Delhi had an air quality index of 319, which falls in the very poor category on Diwali. However, this was much better than 2016 when AQI on Diwali was 431 in severe levels and 343 in 2015. In the wee hours of the day after Diwali 2017, the AQI for Delhi was 340. In 2016, the AQI of the day after was 445 while in 2015 it was 360. This year, it's marginally higher at 343.The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research had earlier forecasted worse quality air for Wednesday evening and Thursday.""The highest levels of PM10 and PM2.5 are expected between 11am to 3am on Wednesday and Thursday. Air quality will be bad on Thursday and start to improve from Friday even if partial toxic crackers as compared to 2017 is burned,"" the government-run agency had warned.According to SAFAR, both stubble burning in surrounding states of Delhi and firecrackers are causing deterioration of air quality in the national capital. ""The fire counts are seen to be very high but it is a combination of stubble burning and widespread firecrackers in that region and need not be confused with stubble only fire,"" the SAFAR said in a report Wednesday.It also said that the combination of several rapidly changing weather parameters is playing a key role in controlling the air pollution at this time.Delhi's air quality is expected to deteriorate to ""severe plus emergency"" category after Diwali, SAFAR said. ""Even if 50 per cent of the total load of toxic firecrackers as compared to Diwali 2017 is added, the prevailing weather conditions will aggravate the high smoke level and make air quality to persist in severe range for at least two days on November 8 and November 9,"" it said in a report.SAFAR had also predicted that the PM10 concentration of Delhi is expected to reach 575 and PM2.5 to 378 on Thursday, recording the worst air quality of the year if fire crackers are burnt, it said.The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology said the winds coming from north-westerly direction is bringing the influence of biomass burning to Delhi-NCR which may continue up to Thursday morning.Last year, too, the Supreme Court on October 9 had banned sale of firecrackers in Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) till October 31. However, there was no such order against buying and bursting and Delhi is solely responsible for the air it breathes due to the current weather conditions.This year, the apex court ordered that firecrackers, other than green crackers, will not be sold in the Delhi-NCR region this Diwali and other festivals, this comes as a viable alternative for many. But on ground people wished to ignore the ban and burst and burnt anars, phuljharis and rockets.Earlier, anticipating high pollution levels between November 1-10, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control and Prevention Authority (EPCA) had announced shutting down of construction activities for 10 days in the Delhi -NCR region, shutting down of coal and biomass-based industries from November 4-10, and have requested people to limit exposure to the foul air in these ten days.""However, what is required is the participation and involvement of all of us in combating the pollution crisis, which we know is a grave health crisis. We are appealing to all citizens of NCR to join in the battle against air pollution,"" it had said.On Tuesday, EPCA also announced ban on entry of trucks into Delhi, an emergency measure under the Graded Response Action Plan, from November 8-10, keeping in mind high post-Diwali pollution levels.

It's Delhi after all"".""Peak Delhi is people bursting crackers while wearing pollution masks. Wow. I have no words,"" a journalism student tweeted with Twitter handle 'Cosmic noodle'.Another user tweeted, ""If this isn't mass contempt of #SupremeCourt, then what is? Non stop crackers is what I was hearing last night. Full on. Anarchy. How can u do this #delhi?""A Twitter user expressed angst by saying that the fire used to light crackers for festivities will choke the same people too.Another user said that the citizens who take pride in being Indians should act responsibly in their daily lives as well.""The air is so polluted in Delhi that one can just choke to death. The city has become a breathing hell. #Diwali #DelhiPollution #masscontempt,"" Martand Jha tweeted.Shruti Chan, a software professional, tweeted, ""It feels Delhiites bursted crackers only to let Supreme Court order down #Delhichoked #masscontempt #pollution"".Another user tweeted a pollution index to prove point of how the capital witnessed a huge jump in air pollution on Diwali night.Delhi recorded its worst air quality of the year the morning after Diwali as the pollution level entered the ""severe-plus emergency"" category due to rampant bursting of toxic firecrackers, authorities said.People in several cities burst firecrackers until at least midnight, two hours after the 10 PM deadline set by the Supreme Court.Partly as a result of smoke from the firecrackers, the overall air quality index (AQI) in Delhi jumped to 574, which falls in the ""severe-plus emergency"" category, according to data by the Centre-run SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research).The overall AQI was 10 times the permissible limit. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"". AQI above 500 falls in the ""severe-plus emergency"" category.The Central Pollution Control Board had also opened social media accounts for netizens to lodge complaints of the violation of the anti-pollution guidelines.

What's behind Delhi's bad-air day after Diwali?,"NEW DELHI: As everyone expected, air pollution levels skyrocketed in Delhi a day after Diwali. India's capital was ranked the most polluted city in the world on Thursday with air quality index, or AQI, hitting 980 at 4:30 am, according to AirVisual, which monitors air pollution around the world. Lahore (Pakistan) was second with its AQI at 273. Readings below 50 are considered safe, while anything above 300 is considered hazardous.Many culpritsDelhi's pollution is a mix of bursting of crackers (on Diwali), vehicular exhaust, smoke from burning crops in neighbouring Punjab and Haryana, road dust and fine sand from thousands of construction sites.Reason is season While Delhi pollutes more every year, which day will be its real bad-air day depends more on winter weather patterns than the amount of pollutants it adds to the air. /Sample this: on Sunday, Delhi had its cleanest November air in three years but on Monday the pollution level had peaked to the season's worst. That was because the upper level wind direction had changed from (comparatively cleaner) easterly and south-easterly to north-westerly that brought in stubble burning smoke from Punjab and Haryana.

Six UP cities among nine most polluted cities in the country with AQI over 400,"AGRA: Six cities of Uttar Pradesh were among the nine most polluted cities in the country on Friday with ""severe"" air quality and an AQI of over 400 (PM 2.5/PM 10). In the dubious list, barring Delhi, Bhiwadi and Faridabad, all other cities are from the state. TRACK THE AIR POLLUTION IN YOUR CITYAccording to air quality monitoring data released by the Central Pollution Control Board, the pollution levels in six cities in UP -- Agra, Baghpat, Bulandshahr, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida -- crossed the ""alarming level"" of 400, which means that exposure to such air may affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing respiratory diseases.Faridabad (Haryana) recorded the poorest air quality with 460 PM 2.5, followed by Bhiwadi (Rajasthan) with an AQI of 453 PM 10, Greater Noida (447), Bulandshahar and Noida at (442), Ghaziabad (441), Delhi (423), Agra (408), and Baghpat (406). In UP, five cities out of the 11 monitored by CPCB, recorded ""Very poor"" air quality. These cities were Hapur with an AQI of 378, followed by state capital, Lucknow at 377,Moradabad (363), Varanasi (344), and Muzaffarnagar (336). An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ""good"", which means minimal impact, 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"" that means minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people, 101 and 200 ""moderate"" means breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases.However, above 200 means between 201 and 300 is considered as ""poor"" (breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure), 301 and 400 ""very poor"" (Respiratory illness on prolonged exposure), and 401 and 500 ""severe"" (Affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases). Scientist at Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), posted in Agra, Pawan Shisodiya said that the air quality is likely to remain the same in the next couple of days as smoke from fire crackers has slowed down the process of pollutant dispersion. /He said, ""there is a dire need to address this issue as there is not one but many factors responsible for the poor air quality including vehicular pollution, dust due to construction activities and burning of solid water in open"". Environmentalist, Dr Sharad Gupta, also a paediatrician said, ""We are living in a gas chamber and this is because of poor air quality"". He said that number of patients with respiratory disorder have been increasing day by day. Continuous exposure to such air quality are now affecting even healthy persons.

This is how the smog is affecting your body!,"It's that time of the year again when the city we live in and the air we breathe has turned into a poisonous gas chamber. The Air Quality Index (AQI), which indicates how clean the air is has gone past the dangerous mark and touched severe levels in some areas, forcing people to stay indoors. In a recent advisory issued by the Pollution Control Board, it was also advised that people avoid any exercise, including running or jogging in the first ten days of November. /Not just that, stepping out without a mask has become very risky. Wondering what are the health risks you are exposing yourself to? We tell you:What is smog?While it's common to see fog envelop the skies in winters, when smoke reacts with the condensed water droplets, it causes smog. The smoke itself arises from burning crops, factories, vehicles which release hazardous components like sulphur dioxide, soot.How does the body react to it?Smog gets settled in our lungs quite quickly, with chemicals and toxins finding their way in easily. As we breathe, we inhale smog instead of clean air, putting ourselves at a risk for diseases and complications.Health risksSmog is quite risky for people with breathing problems, children and older people whose lungs are weaker. Doctors advise people to avoid any kind of outdoor activity, including exercise for as long as possible because the air contains high levels of chemicals which can prove to be very lethal.A lot of problems arise from the presence of PM 2.5 particles in the air, the tiny particles get mixed into our blood and trouble the cholesterol levels, which can further lead to heart complications. In a study conducted in America in 2012, it was found that people living in polluted areas had a 10% greater risk of undergoing a heart attack than others.Watch out for these symptoms!Smog and pollution can prove deadly even for the healthy ones. The most identifiable symptoms include nose and eye irritation, redness around the eyes, shortness of breath, persisting headache, congestion. In some cases, it was also found that even healthy adults were at the risk of developing asthma and other respiratory complications.Newborns at high riskPollution levels this dangerous also carry a lot of risks for expecting mothers and newborn children. High concentrates of carbon monoxide found in the air can interfere with the blood supply and stop oxygen from reaching the brain, hampering development. Can it also lead to cancer?While there is no conclusive evidence yet, researchers and doctors have pointed out that the levels of particulate matter(PM) found in the air we breathe is getting more resilient than before, impacting our immune system.

Track the pollution level in your cityDr Kajal Kumud, physician at Civil Hospital, said, ""There was a 50% increase in patient footfall, especially of those with breathing problems including asthma, at the hospital in the past week. /On Thursday, there was a long queue of patients who complained of running nose, burning eyes, wheezing, repeated cough, etc, mainly due to inhaling air polluted with emission from firecrackers.""New patients are coming up with adult onset asthma, which earlier was earlier a rarity, he added. This condition occurs when adults above 20 years of age are diagnosed with asthma for the first time. ""Besides witnessing patients with exacerbation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, many new patients with adult onset asthma, which was a rarity before, are coming to us. Elderly people were affected the most by higher air and noise pollution, which has aggravated respiratory and auditory problems,"" said Dr Arunesh Kumar, senior consultant, pulmonology, Paras Hospital.Kumar added that despite the Supreme Court guidelines for Diwali, air quality index (AQI) in Delhi-NCR crossed the 900 mark with dangerously high PM2.5 levels, which is hazardous to health. He said he expects further rise in cases of pulmonary infections and other problems like skin allergies and eye infections.""Dr Neetu Talwar, paediatric pulmonologist at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, said, ""Pollution in winters has worsened. Respiratory problems in children and risks of viral illnesses is higher, as they are more vulnerable and go to schools or daycare or crches, where transmission between children increases. Smog tends to settle down with air pollutants and children inhale these in greater amount. We have seen increase in footfall since Diwali, probably due to worse AQI.""

Kolkata chokes on Diwali night as noisy crackers make way for smokier ones,"KOLKATA: All three automated pollution-monitoring stations in the city recorded a PM2.5 count of above 500 for five straight hours on Diwali night, sparking a debate on whether the drive for less-noisy crackers pushed revellers to go for fireworks emitting more light - and smoke - and causing the stratospheric levels of air pollution.The highest PM2.5 count for the period between 12 midnight and 5 am on Thursday was recorded by the monitoring station at the US Consulate. It logged 624 at 1 am before going on the blink from 2 am to 4 am. The other two stations - on the Rabindra Bharati University campus and at Victoria Memorial - too recorded a constant PM2.5 count of 500 for these five hours.PM2.5 refers to particulate matters of size 2.5 micrometres, which are considered to be the most hazardous for human health because their tiny size lets them enter lungs and the blood stream unhindered. A count between 91 and 120 is deemed to be poor; a count between 121 and 250 is considered to be very poor; and anything above 250 is classified as severe.The 500-or-above counts logged by the city for five consecutive hours, environmentalists said, would put the 2018 Diwali as one of the most polluting in recent years. /The high PM2.5 count also ensured that Kolkata's air quality index, a 24-hour average of the most prominent pollutants, remained more than 370 throughout Thursday. The Kali Puja night, too, was almost as bad, as TOI reported in its Thursday morning edition.The alarming levels of air pollution focused debate on the city's push for less-noisy crackers this Kali Puja and Diwali. To generate the colourful lights emitted by these less-noisy fireworks, manufacturers pack them with hazardous metals like barium, potassium, copper, manganese, aluminium, zinc and antimony. The fireworks burst, releasing fine particulate matter into the air; these enter the lungs and blood stream along with the air we inhale.West Bengal Pollution Control Board chairman Kalyan Rudra is among the experts who have been insisting that fireworks, which do not make much sound, may be more harmful as toxic chemicials and metals are used to produce colourful lights.'Children, elderly are most at risk'WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra said, ""We have to focus on air quality as it affects both the poor and the rich. Some may ask what permanent harm crackers being burst on one or two nights can do. But we find conditions remaining poor for days after a dramatic plunge in air quality.""""Another worry is these festivals take place at the onset of winter, when dispersal of pollutants is a problem,"" he added.Preventive medicine expert Arup Dutta confirmed that the fine particulate matter, laden with heavy metals and toxic chemicals, entering the lungs could cause multiple problems - from severe COPD to fatal strokes. Studies have conclusively shown that children and the elderly are the most vulnerable. ""The higher conentration of PM2.5 makes Kolkata's air even more toxic,"" environment scientist Sudipta Bhattacharya of Saviours and Friends of Environment (SaFE) agreed.Atmospheric conditions have only aggravated matters. A low cloud cover during the day and absence of sunlight have made dispersal of pollutants excruciatingly slow. National Environment and Engineering Research Institute scientists said decrease in temperature and wind speed have led to rise in PM2.5 values. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Air quality better now, but still in 'very poor' category","PATNA: There was some respite for the residents of state capital on Friday as the level of Air Quality Index (AQI) plunged 79 points over the last 24 hours, but it continued to remain in the ""very poor"" category.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)'s AQI bulletin states that 'very poor' air can lead to respiratory illnesses on prolonged exposure.The AQI is an assessment of the air quality taking into account eight pollutants: PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 10 micron), PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 micron), nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, ammonia and lead. The AQI of Patna witnessed a steep hike due to burning of crackers on Diwali even beyond the restricted time slot of 8 to 10pm as per a recent Supreme Court order. It surged from 396 on Wednesday evening to 427 on Thursday evening, putting the AQI into ""severe"" category, which can affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases.Environment advocacy groups claimed that the level of air pollution in Patna was higher this Diwali as compared to previous year. /""The average concentration of PM2.5 particulate matter less than 2.5 micrograms per cubic metre on this Diwali was more severe as compared to the previous year. The four-hour average PM2.5 concentration in 2017 had reached 778 micrograms per cubic metre, while the highest peak this year was 920 micrograms per cubic metre.

But in Rachakonda and Cyberabad police commissionerates, no cases were registered by the police in this regard.While Hyderabad and Rachakonda police officials said they would allow bursting of fire crackers only during the two-hour time bracket for three days beginning Diwali, there were several complaints from citizens alleging that the cops made absolutely no efforts to implement the rules.Some denizens also took to social media to vent their anger and draw the attention of the authorities towards the flouting of the norms.NS Pravalika, an animal activist, posted photo copies of the police notice and tweeted, ""What is the use of these notices when people have violated the rules. Police have failed to implement the directions given by the Supreme Court"".She also tagged the Twitter handle of the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) stating that ""there is no use of their (TSPCB) existence when people are flouting rules despite air pollution being a serious threat"".P Sathwik, a resident of SR Nagar, said, ""People in our locality were bursting firecrackers even after midnight. /The police station is just a few meters away and yet no action was taken to stop them"".In response to a Twitter complaint, Rachakonda police tweeted, ""It is responsibility of every citizen to help police to maintain order in society. Instead of merely complaining, one should also be a good Samaritan and help stop such events if one can. This will help society in a major way (sic)"". However, Pravalika said the police officials themselves don't seem to be aware of the rules, ""I had been patrolling all alone from 9 am.

Maybe the local government authority can instead plan for a colourful display for an hour or too every year instead,"" says Vishali.THE FIREWORKS WERE PRETTY, BUT THESE FACTS AIN'T There's smoke this year too, just like last year, with the PM 2.5 values increasing. While last year, the PM2.5 values stood at a maximum of 786 and the PM10 at 963, the PM 2.5 and 10 both stand at 985 this year. PM2.5 indicates fine particulates that are more harmful than PM10 as they can enter lungs and blood stream, causing harmful effects For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

City's average air quality on Diwali better than last year's,"Jaipur: The average air quality recorded in Jaipur on Diwali (November 7) was almost half of what was recorded last year, saving the residents from much health trouble. Thanks to high-velocity winds, moderate temperature and the government's clampdown on firecrackers. The PM 2.5 in Jaipur on Diwali was just 194 while last year it was 496, which had almost choked the city and had caused breathing problems to even those otherwise healthy. /The index value is measured in particle matter 2.5 (Particles smaller than 2.5 microns). The figures are an average of the 24 hours starting from 4 pm on November 7, till November 8. ""Jaipurites were lucky this year due to extremely favourable meteorological activity. The wind flow for hours, during the peak of cracker-burning was a big saviour. The moderate temperature with clear skies is the ideal condition for the particles to settle down in the atmosphere,"" said VK Singhal, chief engineer, Rajasthan Pollution Control Board (RPCB). Attributing the aggressive efforts of the government, Singhal added that burning of crackers was less this year due to the awareness programmes. ""The result is due to the consistent and constant efforts. The decline in the construction activities and less vehicular traffic, have complemented the burning of fewer crackers,"" said Singhal. Jaipur's air quality was also better than most of the tier-II cities like Agra, Pune, Kanpur, Bhubaneshwar and Patna indicating that the sustained efforts have yielded positive results. However, the average air quality in the last 24 hours from 4 pm on November 8 to November 9, has shot up to 241. The experts say that it is a result of the burning of firecrackers on November 8. Doctors have advised that patients with chronic illnesses should stay indoors. ""Until the air pollution levels touch normal, people shouldn't expose themselves directly to smoke or to places subjected to smog,"" said Dr Bhawna Sharma, neurophysicist at SMS hospital. The poorest air quality in Rajasthan was recorded in Jodhpur. It recorded PM 308, while in Jaipur it was PM 194 on Diwali. The PM level 100 is considered fit for humans to breath, says the data available on SameerApp (Govt of India).

Smog in the city,"It was the festival of lights, or as it has turned into in recent years, the festival of noise and poisonous fumes. And as the City of Joy exploded in celebration, the foggy, humid weather combined with the acrid fumes from firecrackers to turn the city air into a toxic mix of gas and particulate matter. All three automated pollution-monitoring stations in the city recorded a PM2.5 count of above 500 for five straight hours on Diwali night. Reliving his experience on that evening, actor and fitness buff Tota Roy Choudhury told us, ""Around 5 on that evening, I took a walk on the roof of my house in Kakurgachi. /After a few minutes, my eyes and nostrils started to burn and I felt mildly out of breath. Feverish is the right word. Even that early in the evening, there was a thin layer of smog over the area. The situation grew even worse later in the evening."" The air seemed to have cleared quite a bit since that evening, so we visited Maidan with Tota on Friday morning to put it to test. ""We reached around 6.30 am, but to my dismay, I saw a thin layer of smog still hanging over the area. I was proven right when I started jogging. I felt my lungs were not getting enough oxygen and the air felt thicker than usual,"" he told us. ""That's when I realised that working out in this polluted air is actually counterproductive; I was doing more harm to my body than good. As I walked back to my car, I met some locals, who told me that the smog is not going anywhere for at least a week. On the way home, I looked at my beautiful city and thought how we are responsible for this. We are poisoning our air and water. I don't know what kind of a world we are leaving behind for our future generations."" As Tota rightly pointed out, exercising in polluted air causes more harm than good to your body. So obviously, those who play cricket or football at Maidan have been having a hard time in the last four-five days. Dizziness, coupled with a burning sensation in the eyes and nostrils, is common. Alam Khan, a regular at Maidan, told us, ""I play cricket regularly at Maidan. But in the past few days, the smog has made it difficult. If I run for some time, I have breathing problems. I'm experiencing this for the first time."" A slow killer City environmentalists told us that the bursting of crackers and fireworks releases a huge amount of greenhouse gases. While methane transforms into carbon dioxide and water after burning, poisonous gases like phosgene are also released. Besides, the process adds a large amount of suspended particulate matter (SPM) to the air. According to ornithologist Sumit Sen, the high noise levels and poisonous fumes also wreak havoc on the city's wildlife. ""Sadly, no study has been conducted to access how much the environment in the city is affected during Diwali or how long the affect lasts,"" he said, adding that due to the pollution, smaller animals get more affected than the bigger species. ""Though the carbon dioxide released during Diwali is good for trees, the particulate matter and dust cover trees and hampers photosynthesis,"" Sen added. Environmentalist Subhas Datta agreed. ""The polluted air has a more adverse effect on the environment. Along with the elderly and children, pregnant women are also hugely affected by the noise and air pollution,"" he said. The health hazards Dr Sankar Paul Chowdhury, cardiologist at RG Kar Hospital, said the constant exposure to carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide can lead to a number of diseases. Besides, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases can suffer. ""The smoke and dust may cause chest infection and breathing problems,"" Dr Chowdhury added. The children, however, are the worst sufferers. Paediatrician Dr Soumitra Dutta said in the last week, respiratory problems among children has increased three-fold. He said the dust particles mostly affect skin and the mucus membranes of our body. In case of the children, both these organs are extremely vulnerable. ""The SPM enters the body through the nose and mouth and affects mucus membrane in the nose, lungs and chest. This can lead to a number of diseases like tracheitis, bronchitis, asthma and allergic reactions,"" he added. Safeguards against air pollution hazards Avoid exercising outdoors when pollution levels are high. When the air quality is bad, walk indoors in a shopping mall or gym or use a treadmill. Limit the amount of time your child spends playing outdoors.

Smog in the city,"It was the festival of lights, or as it has turned into in recent years, the festival of noise and poisonous fumes. And as the City of Joy exploded in celebration, the foggy, humid weather combined with the acrid fumes from firecrackers to turn the city air into a toxic mix of gas and particulate matter. All three automated pollution-monitoring stations in the city recorded a PM2.5 count of above 500 for five straight hours on Diwali night. Reliving his experience on that evening, actor and fitness buff Tota Roy Choudhury told us, ""Around 5 on that evening, I took a walk on the roof of my house in Kakurgachi. /After a few minutes, my eyes and nostrils started to burn and I felt mildly out of breath. Feverish is the right word. Even that early in the evening, there was a thin layer of smog over the area. The situation grew even worse later in the evening."" The air seemed to have cleared quite a bit since that evening, so we visited Maidan with Tota on Friday morning to put it to test. ""We reached around 6.30 am, but to my dismay, I saw a thin layer of smog still hanging over the area. I was proven right when I started jogging. I felt my lungs were not getting enough oxygen and the air felt thicker than usual,"" he told us. ""That's when I realised that working out in this polluted air is actually counterproductive; I was doing more harm to my body than good. As I walked back to my car, I met some locals, who told me that the smog is not going anywhere for at least a week. On the way home, I looked at my beautiful city and thought how we are responsible for this. We are poisoning our air and water. I don't know what kind of a world we are leaving behind for our future generations."" As Tota rightly pointed out, exercising in polluted air causes more harm than good to your body. So obviously, those who play cricket or football at Maidan have been having a hard time in the last four-five days. Dizziness, coupled with a burning sensation in the eyes and nostrils, is common. Alam Khan, a regular at Maidan, told us, ""I play cricket regularly at Maidan. But in the past few days, the smog has made it difficult. If I run for some time, I have breathing problems. I'm experiencing this for the first time."" A slow killer City environmentalists told us that the bursting of crackers and fireworks releases a huge amount of greenhouse gases. While methane transforms into carbon dioxide and water after burning, poisonous gases like phosgene are also released. Besides, the process adds a large amount of suspended particulate matter (SPM) to the air. According to ornithologist Sumit Sen, the high noise levels and poisonous fumes also wreak havoc on the city's wildlife. ""Sadly, no study has been conducted to access how much the environment in the city is affected during Diwali or how long the affect lasts,"" he said, adding that due to the pollution, smaller animals get more affected than the bigger species. ""Though the carbon dioxide released during Diwali is good for trees, the particulate matter and dust cover trees and hampers photosynthesis,"" Sen added. Environmentalist Subhas Datta agreed. ""The polluted air has a more adverse effect on the environment. Along with the elderly and children, pregnant women are also hugely affected by the noise and air pollution,"" he said. The health hazards Dr Sankar Paul Chowdhury, cardiologist at RG Kar Hospital, said the constant exposure to carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide can lead to a number of diseases. Besides, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases can suffer. ""The smoke and dust may cause chest infection and breathing problems,"" Dr Chowdhury added. The children, however, are the worst sufferers. Paediatrician Dr Soumitra Dutta said in the last week, respiratory problems among children has increased three-fold. He said the dust particles mostly affect skin and the mucus membranes of our body. In case of the children, both these organs are extremely vulnerable. ""The SPM enters the body through the nose and mouth and affects mucus membrane in the nose, lungs and chest. This can lead to a number of diseases like tracheitis, bronchitis, asthma and allergic reactions,"" he added. Safeguards against air pollution hazards Avoid exercising outdoors when pollution levels are high. When the air quality is bad, walk indoors in a shopping mall or gym or use a treadmill. Limit the amount of time your child spends playing outdoors.

'Severe' air quality: Jharkhand gasps for breath after Diwali,"RANCHI: The air pollution across the state has fallen under the ""severe"" category after Diwali as people defied the Supreme Court's guidelines on bursting crackers. Track the pollution level in your cityThe worst air quality was reported from mining town of Jharia where ambient air quality is recorded by sensors installed at Tata stadium. Jorapokhar, Jharia recorded 187 g/m3 (micron per metre cube) of Particulate Matter (PM)-2.5 for which the standard is set at 60 g/m3. Dhanbad which is a hub for mining activities and home to one of the biggest subsidiaries of Coal India, BCCL, recorded 172 g/m3. Jamsedhpur stood at 170 and Ranchi recorded 162 g/m3. Bokaro, another industrial town in the state which is home to one of the oldest steel plants in the country, was second in the list. /Chas, an industrial suburb located 15km away from Bokaro city center recorded 182 g/m3 of particulate matter 2.5. The figures were collected from AirVisual, an American website which collects real time data of air quality index worldwide on an hourly basis. According to experts the particulate matter remains in the air for few days after bursting of crackers which leads to increase of the pollution level in the air.Speaking to TOI, environmentalist and vice-chancellor of Raksha Shakti University Ranchi M K Jamuar said, ""The particulate matter remains in the air for several days after Diwali as there are various topographic factors which influence its presence in the air. There are only two ways by which particulate matter can be removed from the air."" He added, ""If there is heavy flow of air from one direction to another it will carry the pollutant material away from its suspension position. Another way out is if there are rains after Diwali day the particulate will be washed away due to rains."" ""However, the wind circulation is not upto the mark in Jharkhand during winters which leads to coagulation of particulate matter in the air. This leads to rise in various respiratory diseases during winters,"" Jamuar said.The ambient air quality in various cities across state has declined after Diwali day as it is evident by the reports from Jharkhand State pollution control board (JSPCB) data. According to the data released by JSPCB on August 29, which featured air pollution level in Ranchi. The PM levels were well below the standard levels prescribed by the pollution board. PM 10 stood at 20 g/m3 for which the standard limit is 100g/m3.

'Severe' air quality: Jharkhand gasps for breath after Diwali,"RANCHI: The air pollution across the state has fallen under the ""severe"" category after Diwali as people defied the Supreme Court's guidelines on bursting crackers. Track the pollution level in your cityThe worst air quality was reported from mining town of Jharia where ambient air quality is recorded by sensors installed at Tata stadium. Jorapokhar, Jharia recorded 187 g/m3 (micron per metre cube) of Particulate Matter (PM)-2.5 for which the standard is set at 60 g/m3. Dhanbad which is a hub for mining activities and home to one of the biggest subsidiaries of Coal India, BCCL, recorded 172 g/m3. Jamsedhpur stood at 170 and Ranchi recorded 162 g/m3. Bokaro, another industrial town in the state which is home to one of the oldest steel plants in the country, was second in the list. /Chas, an industrial suburb located 15km away from Bokaro city center recorded 182 g/m3 of particulate matter 2.5. The figures were collected from AirVisual, an American website which collects real time data of air quality index worldwide on an hourly basis. According to experts the particulate matter remains in the air for few days after bursting of crackers which leads to increase of the pollution level in the air.Speaking to TOI, environmentalist and vice-chancellor of Raksha Shakti University Ranchi M K Jamuar said, ""The particulate matter remains in the air for several days after Diwali as there are various topographic factors which influence its presence in the air. There are only two ways by which particulate matter can be removed from the air."" He added, ""If there is heavy flow of air from one direction to another it will carry the pollutant material away from its suspension position. Another way out is if there are rains after Diwali day the particulate will be washed away due to rains."" ""However, the wind circulation is not upto the mark in Jharkhand during winters which leads to coagulation of particulate matter in the air. This leads to rise in various respiratory diseases during winters,"" Jamuar said.The ambient air quality in various cities across state has declined after Diwali day as it is evident by the reports from Jharkhand State pollution control board (JSPCB) data. According to the data released by JSPCB on August 29, which featured air pollution level in Ranchi. The PM levels were well below the standard levels prescribed by the pollution board.

Jaipur's average air quality on Diwali better than last year's,"JAIPUR: The average air quality recorded in Jaipur on Diwali (November 7) was almost half of what was recorded last year, saving the residents from much health trouble. Thanks to high-velocity winds, moderate temperature and the government's clampdown on firecrackers. The PM 2.5 in Jaipur on Diwali was just 194 while last year it was 496, which had almost choked the city and had caused breathing problems to even those otherwise healthy. /The index value is measured in particle matter 2.5 (Particles smaller than 2.5 microns). The figures are an average of the 24 hours starting from 4 pm on November 7, till November 8. ""Jaipurites were lucky this year due to extremely favourable meteorological activity. The wind flow for hours, during the peak of cracker-burning was a big saviour. The moderate temperature with clear skies is the ideal condition for the particles to settle down in the atmosphere,"" said VK Singhal, chief engineer, Rajasthan Pollution Control Board (RPCB). Attributing the aggressive efforts of the government, Singhal added that burning of crackers was less this year due to the awareness programmes. ""The result is due to the consistent and constant efforts. The decline in the construction activities and less vehicular traffic, have complemented the burning of fewer crackers,"" said Singhal. Jaipur's air quality was also better than most of the tier-II cities like Agra, Pune, Kanpur, Bhubaneshwar and Patna indicating that the sustained efforts have yielded positive results. However, the average air quality in the last 24 hours from 4 pm on November 8 to November 9, has shot up to 241. The experts say that it is a result of the burning of firecrackers on November 8. Doctors have advised that patients with chronic illnesses should stay indoors. ""Until the air pollution levels touch normal, people shouldn't expose themselves directly to smoke or to places subjected to smog,"" said Dr Bhawna Sharma, neurophysicist at SMS hospital. The poorest air quality in Rajasthan was recorded in Jodhpur. It recorded PM 308, while in Jaipur it was PM 194 on Diwali. The PM level 100 is considered fit for humans to breath, says the data available on SameerApp (Govt of India).

Counting the ruins: Chandrapur's air most polluted in Maharashtra,"NAGPUR: Two days after Diwali, Chandrapur's air turned out to be the most polluted in the state. The district recorded 'poor' air quality on Friday with particulate matter (PM) 2.5 being the prominent pollutant.Track the pollution level in your city. The National Air Quality Index (AQI) data of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) shows that the air quality monitoring station in Chandrapur recorded an AQI of 214 on Friday, which comes under 'poor' category and can cause breathing discomfort to people on prolonged exposure.A day back, Bandra (Mumbai) had also recorded 'poor' air with an AQI of 235 which improved to 183 on Friday. /On the second day of Diwali, Aurangabad had the worst sir with an index of 290 - Probably the highest of this festive season till now. Apart from it, Nashik recorded a 'poor' AQI of 263 on the same day.The CPCB displays data for nine cities of the state. In almost all these monitoring station, it is evident that the otherwise clean air started deteriorating significantly after the first day of Diwali. For instance, in Bandra, the AQI was varying between 88-129 about two weeks before the festival. However, it worsened by more than two times and suddenly rose to 235 on the next day of Diwali.Similarly, in Pune, the AQI, which was previously 99, went up to 186 after the first day of Diwali. From 75, the index in Nagpur increased by more than two times and was recorded 169 on the second day.According to environment activists, cities in Maharashtra might be more affected from air pollution caused due to firecrackers. ""While in places like Delhi, crackers are burst only for a day, many cities in the state continue revelry for at least 5 days. The impact in this case on public health can be much worse as the smoke emitted from crackers contains cancer-causing agents,"" said Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner at Greenpeace India. Another trend common to most of the cities is that the levels of PM 2.5 and 10 entered the danger zones late in the night in the last two days. In Bandra, the air quality index of PM2.5 was 321 (very poor) around midnight and remained at 311 till 4am. On the intervening night of November 8 and 9, the PM10 index was as high as 500 post midnight in Aurangabad. In Pune too, both PM 2.5 and 10 rose to 500 close to midnight. ""As the temperature drops in the night, the mixing capacity of the atmosphere decreases. Thus, the pollutants get trapped and their concentration in ambient air increases.

From 75, the index in Nagpur increased by more than two times and was recorded 169 on the second day.According to environment activists, cities in Maharashtra might be more affected from air pollution caused due to firecrackers. ""While in places like Delhi, crackers are burst only for a day, many cities in the state continue revelry for at least 5 days. The impact in this case on public health can be much worse as the smoke emitted from crackers contains cancer-causing agents,"" said Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner at Greenpeace India. Another trend common to most of the cities is that the levels of PM 2.5 and 10 entered the danger zones late in the night in the last two days. In Bandra, the air quality index of PM2.5 was 321 (very poor) around midnight and remained at 311 till 4am. On the intervening night of November 8 and 9, the PM10 index was as high as 500 post midnight in Aurangabad. In Pune too, both PM 2.5 and 10 rose to 500 close to midnight. ""As the temperature drops in the night, the mixing capacity of the atmosphere decreases. Thus, the pollutants get trapped and their concentration in ambient air increases. They start dispersing slowly only when the temperature increases,"" said Kavita Rattan, founder president of Green Vigil Foundation. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Rise in pollution boosts sale of air purifiers in city,"PATNA: The 'very poor' air quality in Patna has prompted more and more people to buy air purifiers to prevent harmful pollutants and dust particles from entering their homes and protect themselves from respiratory problems.Those dealing in air purifiers say the sale has registered significant growth as residents have also started seeking technological assistance in a bid to combat the toxic air menace.Several brands of indoor air purifiers are available in selected shops in the state capital.

Mumbai: Feeling the chill? Temperature dips to 20.4C,"MUMBAI: Some pleasant news regarding the weather. The minimum temperature in the suburbs slid on Sunday. The minimum temperature recorded at the Met's Santacruz observatory on Sunday was 20.4 degrees Celsius as against 21.6 degrees a day earlier. /The air quality also improved as compared to the day before. You could expect the minimum temperature to dip further later this month, said weather bureau officials due to the ""northerly winds"", said an official. A scientist from the weather bureau, Bishwombhar, said that minimum temperatures are known to dip gradually after the monsoon season. ""Besides owing to wind direction, humidity levels recorded are low,"" said Bishwombhar. The humidity record at Santacruz was 52%, due to which minimum temperature is dropping as well, he said. In a related development, the air quality index for Mumbai was pegged at 196 on Sunday. A day earlier, it was 231. An index between 101 and 200 is considered 'moderate' but could pose a health concern for people sensitive to air pollution. Asked about the improvement in air quality, he said a gradual improvement in the air was expected after the Diwali festivities as bursting of crackers comes to a halt by then.Sunday's air quality was shades better than what it has been over the last few days with the index scaling 305 on November 8, a day after Diwali. An index between 301 and 400 is considered 'very poor'. People with heart or lung diseases, the elderly and children must avoid prolonged or heavy exertion. The air quality index is recorded by Safar (System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research).Among the 10 spots that were monitored, Andheri continued to remain the 'most polluted' with an index of 348. The day after Diwali, it recorded an index of 452. Other locations which were in the 'very poor' category (301 to 400) on Saturday were Mazgaon and Malad. The least polluted spot was Bandra-Kurla Complex which recorded an index of 147. The forecast is that the overall index will improve albeit marginally (to 191) on Monday.

People suffer as air action plan gathers dust,"Ahmedabad: After three years being spent to draft it, the Air Action Plan for Ahmedabad is gathering dust on bureaucratic shelves even as a latest Lancet study reveals 32% of the state's population is at risk for respiratory diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.In 2016 alone, the Lancet study claims, approximately 43,000 people died of COPD and 9,000 died of chronic asthma in the state. The figure is computed based on epidemiological transition level (ETL)-change in mortality rates brought about by medical advancements -- and disability adjusted life years (DALY). But here's the real danger. In Gujarat, the percentage of citizens facing danger from ambient particulate matter (PM 1, PM2.5 and PM 10) is higher than citizens smoking in Gujarat. /The percentage of population that faces risks of pulmonary diseases due to smoking is nearly 21%. In August, an analysis of 150 patients at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH), New Delhi, by the Lung Care Foundation (LCF) found that close to 50% patients with lung cancer had never smoked, and yet developed pulmonary disease. PM 2.5 or fine particles less than 2.5 microns in size is 30 times finer than a human hair when inhaled. When these enter our blood stream, they cause cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.In September, a Lancet study on changing patterns of cardiovascular diseases in India found air pollution to be the third major risk factor among over 32% men and 29% women suffering from cardiovascular diseases after dietary habits and high systolic blood pressure. Another Lancet study has found outdoor pollution was classified as a cancer-causing agent in 2013 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the World Health Organization.Not just outdoor particulate pollution, but nearly 19% Gujaratis face COPD risk from household air pollution owing to lack of access to cleaner cooking fuels, while 7.5% of the population is exposed to risks of ambient ozone pollution and about 15% is exposed to occupational particulate matter. ""Exposure to ozone causes inflammation of the pulmonary tract, thus making Amdavadis vulnerable to bacterial and viral infections,"" says pulmonary expert Dr Tushar Patel. He adds, ""Diesel and industrial fumes, road dust, construction activities, smoke from close to 400 foundries and two major thermal power plants are reasons why we see a steep rise in chronic pulmonary diseases.GPCB member secretary KC Mistry told TOI, ""The AAP is ready and a committee has been constituted.

Pollution linked to 3.2 million new cases of diabetes in one year,"With an increase in the number of cases from 108 million to 422 million in 24 years, diabetes has become one of the fastest growing diseases. Though the main causes of diabetes include an unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyle and obesity, new researches indicate that outdoor pollution also plays a role.The findings were published in the Lancet Planetary Health. When looked at the particulate matter, airborne microscopic pieces of dust, smoke, dust, liquid droplets and soot, it was found that these particles can enter the lungs and invade the bloodstream and contribute to health issues like stroke, kidney failure, cancer and heart disease. When it comes to diabetes, pollution is considered as one of the major culprits because it triggers inflammation that reduces the production of insulin leading to diabetes. /According to the research, pollution contributed to 3.2 million new diabetes cases in the year 2016. Also, 8.2 million healthy lives were lost due to pollution linked diabetes. The risk of pollution related diabetes is more in countries with low income such as India, China and Indonesia. The lack of resources for environmental mitigation systems and clean air policies lead to increased level of pollution in these countries. How does pollution lead to diabetes?The exact relationship between how air pollution causes diabetes is yet not confirmed. But scientists say when some particular pollutants enter the bloodstream and interact with tissues and organs, it disrupts the body. And among other major health issues, these interruptions alter the insulin production and sensitivity. The surprising thing is that even at the levels that are officially deemed safe, the risk is still significant, adds study.PM 2.5 - why is it the most harmful?If you have gone shopping for an anti-pollution mask you must have noticed the masks that promise to keep you safe from particulate matter rating PM 2.5 are considered to be the best. This is because PM 2.5 is the most harmful since it's tiny and contains toxic metals. Its small size allows it to penetrate the lungs and reach our bloodstreams from where it can circulate to various organs. This can cause inflammation, which ultimately raises insulin resistance. The increased insulin sensitivity can disable the pancreas to pump out enough insulin and cause diabetes.The relation between gestational diabetes and pollutionThe women who get exposed to nitrogen oxide and sulphur dioxide during the first few weeks of pregnancy (first trimester) drastically increases their chances of developing gestational diabetes. Exposure to ozone during the later pregnancy can increase the chances of developing type 2 and GDM diabetes later in life. The harmful pollutants can even cause hormonal imbalance in pregnant women and cause a haywire in their bodies.What diabetic people can do?- Always check the air quality before leaving the house and stay indoors if the air quality is poor.- Avoid going outside during the rush hours. This can cut the inhalation of traffic-related pollutants. - Avoid travelling during the hottest time of the day as plants tend to release the most pollen during the warmer temperature.- Do not stand near a photocopy machine as it emits ozone gas. Indoor pollution can be more harmful than outdoor pollution in many cases. - Consume jaggery (gur), vitamin C rich foods, omega 3 fatty acids and magnesium. These help to flush out the toxins from your body and make your system clean.- Keep indoor plants that have the capability to purify the air. You can also invest in an air purifier.- Wear an anti-pollution mask.- Drink plenty of water.TipChildren suffer more damage than adults as their metabolism is fast, they have lower tolerance power and they breathe rapidly. Do not let them play outside when the pollution level is high. Make them wear a mask and feed them healthy food. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Monitor pollution caused by your vehicle in real-time,"CHANDIGARH: Motorists can now keep a real-time check on the level of pollution caused by their vehicles and take immediate corrective steps.An Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Ropar assistant professor and her students have developed a device that can monitor and read the pollution caused by vehicles using a pollution sensor, micro-controller and smartphone.The device, developed by Dr Sujata Pal along with Anindo Ghosh and Vivek Sethi, has been successfully tested on several vehicles. The team plans to file for a patent soon after making a few modifications in the device.The device, explains Dr Pal, comprises a pollution sensor that is installed near the exhaust pipe of the vehicle and it measures quality of the emission every 30 seconds. It sends this data to the micro-controller, which in turn, sends this data to a smartphone wirelessly, either using Internet or a Bluetooth connection.The team has also developed an application to read and store the data on the smartphone. /The microcontroller can also transfer this data to any device with an Internet connection. ""The device will help the drivers to monitor and control pollution generated by their vehicles,"" said Dr Pal.Device to monitor pollution set to help traffic personnelThe device is expected to cost around Rs 1,000. To keep the cost down, Dr Pal said her team used low-cost pollution sensor and micro-controller.With over 10 lakh registered vehicles, Chandigarh has the highest density of vehicles in the country. On an average, each family in the city owns more than two cars. Delhi has over 1 crore registered vehicles and there are over 98 lakh and over 60 lakh registered motorised vehicles in Punjab and Haryana, respectively. As vehicles are a major contributor to air pollution, the device to measure emissions in real time can come in handy to tackle the problem.For every smoke-emitting vehicle, it is mandatory to obtain a pollution-under control (PUC) certificate, which is valid for a period of 6 months. Dr Pal said if the government approves the device, it will help the traffic personnel monitor emissions from vehicles in real time. ""The cops will be able to identify the vehicles that are emitting pollutants higher than the permissible levels. At present, the cops have to rely on the PUCs only,"" she added.

'Aggravated by pollutants',"Ahmedabad: As World Diabetes Day is observed across the globe on November 14, to raise awareness about the growing menace of this lifestyle disease, experts said a new front has opened up which city dwellers have to fight while battling the condition.Dr Tiven Marwah, a city-based diabetologist and endocrinologist, said that the disease is striking younger people and is spreading ever wider. Besides factors such as stress, sedentary lifestyles and bad eating habits, one also has to factor in pollutants.""There has been no substantial study in Gujarat or India but experts in the West are establishing links between a specific sets of pollutants and the beta cells in the pancreas which release insulin. While pollution cannot cause diabetes, it can aggravate the condition. /We call these environmental factors endocrine disrupters,"" he said, adding that the impact in the Indian context, with cities like Delhi choking from air pollution, needs to be studied.He added that the spread of disease is now 10 times what it used to be two decades ago. Dr Banshi Saboo, a city-based diabetologist, said society has to address the issue of sedentary lifestyles. ""I would say that sitting is akin to smoking. You should not sit for more than 90 minutes at one go. This year's theme is centred around the family. We advise family members of people diagnosed with diabetes to go for screening. One also has to understand the burden carried by the young patients for the rest of their lives,"" he said.Dr Saboo was part of a pan-India study on diabetes by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which found that about 15% of the population below 40 years is susceptible to diabetes.Screening important part of the fightExperts consider screening to be an important aspect of the fight. Dr Sanjeev Phatak, a city-based diabetologist, said that more than half of all patients are diagnosed only when they go for a medical check-up. ""We say that the treatment of diabetes is like the power play in cricket - if you are careful in the early years, managing it becomes easier afterwards,"" he said.He added that now there is virtually no difference in prevalance of the condition based on parameters such as gender, income level or geographic area, whether urban or rural.

You should not sit for more than 90 minutes at one go. This year's theme is centred around the family. We advise family members of people diagnosed with diabetes to go for screening. One also has to understand the burden carried by the young patients for the rest of their lives,"" he said.Dr Saboo was part of a pan-India study on diabetes by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which found that about 15% of the population below 40 years is susceptible to diabetes.Screening important part of the fightExperts consider screening to be an important aspect of the fight. Dr Sanjeev Phatak, a city-based diabetologist, said that more than half of all patients are diagnosed only when they go for a medical check-up. ""We say that the treatment of diabetes is like the power play in cricket - if you are careful in the early years, managing it becomes easier afterwards,"" he said.He added that now there is virtually no difference in prevalance of the condition based on parameters such as gender, income level or geographic area, whether urban or rural.
