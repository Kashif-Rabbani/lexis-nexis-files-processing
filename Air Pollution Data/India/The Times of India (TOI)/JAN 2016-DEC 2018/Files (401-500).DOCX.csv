Baba Farid NSS volunteers take out anti-cracker rally for Green Diwali,"BATHINDA: An anti-cracker rally was organized on Wednesday by the students of Bathinda based Baba Farid Group of Institutions to observe pollution free Diwali. The rally was organized by the NSS unit of Baba Farid College. Baba Farid group chairman Gurmeet Singh Dhaliwal and MD Paramjit Kaur Dhaliwal flagged off the rally at the institute.More than 100 NSS volunteers participated in the awareness rally by holding banners with different slogans to celebrate the pollution free Diwali. All NSS volunteers took the oath that they would observe pollution-free Green Diwali and notify the people in the town, villages and protect the environment from noise and air pollution. Gurmeet Dhaliwal said that people are becoming victims of many chronic diseases due to increased pollution in our environment. ""People should be aware to protect the environment from getting polluted and we need to inspire others to celebrate the pollution free Diwali"", he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Stubble burning affecting health of 84% people: Survey,"Chandigarh: Punjab farmers burning crop stubble have been blamed for the smog that envelopes the region, including the national capital. Now, an extensive study by a group of doctors from Bathinda has revealed ""alarming"" proportions of adverse health effects of the way crop residue is got rid of. Ironically, the rural population itself is the most affected by the polluted air.The survey of 8,573 people - a mix of urban and rural population - found that 84.5% were suffering from health problems because of smoke and that more of these people lived in in rural areas.Dr Vitull K Gupta, professor with the department of medicine, Adesh Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Bathinda, told TOI, ""Stubble burning is creating dangerous air pollution, causing adverse health effects in majority of population which necessitates drastic steps involving all the stakeholders.""Irritation in eyes was reported by 76.8% people, irritation in nose by 44.8%, irritation in throat by 45.5%. Cough or increase in cough was reported by 41.6% respondents and wheezing because of smoke by 18.0%. Due to the polluted environment, 23.9% people reported waking up during the night because of either cough/wheeze/shortness of breath or tightness in the chest, which included 24.6% young, 15.9% old, 25.2% males, 22.4% females, 27.9% urban and 17.6% rural people.The adverse health effects are even making 25.1% people consult doctors and it includes 29.6% from urban and 18.3% from rural areas.Crop residue and biomass burning (forest fires) are considered as a major source of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides and halogen compounds, Gupta said.One tonne of straw, when burnt, releases about 3kg of particulate matter, 60kg carbon monoxide, 1,460kg carbon dioxide, 199kg ash and 2kg sulphur dioxide. /The burning of 130 to 150 lakh tonnes of paddy straw in 20 days generates pollution equal to what the industry in state generates within a year. The resultant haze and low-hanging clouds of smoke, exacerbated by low temperature and slow wind speed, are a lethal health hazard, posing serious risks to health of the people and increases existing diseases.More symptoms are experienced in rural areas as compared to urban and a majority of people experience a combination of one to four symptoms. It has been found that most of the particulate released due to agriculture crop residue burning are smaller than 10 microns (PM10), and easily enter lungs, causing heart problems./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pollution soars much before firecrackers steal the show,"Pune: Harmful pollutants filled up the city's air hours before the Diwali night, when celebrations generally peak amid bursting of firecrackers. Real-time pollution data of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology's (IITM) System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) revealed that of the 10 monitored locations in the city saw various pollutants reaching ""unhealthy levels"" during early Thursday evening. The pollutants included ozone (O3) and carbon-monoxide (CO).Shivajinagar and Katraj saw the maximum presence of harmful pollutants particulate matter PM10 and PM2.5. It was twice or four times than the maximum permissible limit, the data showed.Though the maximum permissible limit of PM 2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic metre of air (ug/m3), the pollutant was four-times higher limit in Shivajinagar and Katraj during the early Diwali evening at 7 pm.In Hadapsar, the pollutant was almost two-and-a-half times above the permissible limit. /The CO levels was high in Manjari and Lohegaon. Ozone levels in Bhumkar Chowk touched 102 parts per billion (ppb) by the evening, crossing the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of 50 ppb.Ozone values above 50ppb can harm sensitive people such as children, elderly and those who suffer from asthma and other respiratory diseases.Sundeep Salvi, director of Chest Research Foundation, India and an expert on effects of air pollution on health, told TOI that the Diwali afternoon saw a high incidence of people burning firecrackers after pujas at workplaces. ""The traffic was thin, but the pollution levels crossed the maximum permissible limit. This could only be attributed to firecrackers. The night of Diwali is expected to see a further surge in pollution from firecrackers, as the temperature drops during that time and the air becomes heavy. Wind does not flow under such circumstances. As a result, smoke and pollutants stay in the air for a longer time,"" he said. Air pollution in the city during Diwali 2016 was at its worst since 2013. SAFAR scientists had found the air quality index ""high"" on October 30, 31 and November 1, 2016 - the main days of the festival of lights. If the air quality index is between 201-300, it is categorized as ""poor"". The index is considered ""very poor"" if it is between 301-400. This indicates health risks for people sensitive to air pollution./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Doctors call for less noise and more light,"VISAKHAPATNAM: During Diwali it is not uncommon for hospitals to get cases of burn injuries and pulmonary or lung diseases following exposure to excessive air pollution. Every year, the burns and plastic surgery wards of King George Hospital (KGH) get several outpatients immediately the day following Diwali or sometimes during the festival night. Head of the department of plastic surgery at KGH Dr P V Sudhakar said, ""As per our culture, we cannot ask for a total ban on bursting crackers. But we can exercise moderation. While decorations with lights, candles and diyas are absolutely fine, people should avoid bursting crackers that cause too much of smoke and noise pollution, beyond the permissible levels. The public should also take precautionary measures such as avoiding hanging synthetic clothes near fire and putting out halfburnt or semi-inflamed crackers as they can suddenly burst when least expected causing injuries."" In view of the upcoming diwali celebrations, consultant physician Dr Kishore Sabbu and consultant pulmonologist Dr Sailendra Vaddadi from MyCure Hospitals also expressed concerns that soon after diwali, a large number of patients come to the hospital every year with moderate to severe respiratory discomforts and other critical ailments and skin-related problems./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Mumbai celebrates a less noisy Diwali as children burst fewer crackers,"MUMBAI: Diwali is indeed getting quieter with each passing year, and the credit goes to schools that have managed to condition children against bursting firecrackers by repeatedly reinforcing the ill-effects of noise and air pollution they cause. As a result, Diwali 2017 appears to be relatively less noisy.After 9pm, Marine Drive, parts of Dadar, Lalbaug, Kandivli East, Ghatkopar and Powai reported loud bursts, though they were still fewer than in the previous years.Sumaira Abdulali of Awaaz Foundation told TOI: ""Throughout the city, there were very few crackers. Most people were seen bursting noiseless crackers instead of bombs. /It feels much lower than last year.""Without children as consumers to drive this segment, cracker sales have progressively dwindled. Ajay Sethi, whose son studies at a leading school in Andheri West, recalled how he would insist on ladi bombs during his childhood. ""But Ayaan, my son, did not even stop by the cracker stall when we went shopping at Andheri market. I said he could choose colourful sparklers or anaars but he said his teacher had said these too leave a trail of smoke. My wife and I shrugged and gave up,"" he said.What has helped the anti-pollution cause is fewer cracker shops in the city, following the Bombay high court order to deny licences to such stalls in residential zones. Lokhandwala Road in Andheri has barely two stalls where once there were 15-20. The Delhi high court ban on firecrackers has radiated its effects in Mumbai as well. I-T professional Shantanu Banerjee of Kandivli is just back from an assignment in the national capital. He said, ""It is true that we in Mumbai do not face additional threats from crop burning or cold weather that are polluting Delhi and causing smog and haze. But any amount of caution is welcome. Already the horizon is hazy through the day, especially in the morning. The Delhi high court order is an alarm call for a megapolis like Mumbai where traffic is causing enormous heat and pollution. Burning firecrackers will exacerbate the problem even temporarily.""This Diwali, though, localities such as Dadar, Worli, Prabhadevi, Bandra East, Andheri, Malad, Borivli and Mulund, which once reverberated with sound late into the night, reported fewer bursts. This, despite the entry of newer varieties of colourful and noiseless crackers that emit only light.""After all, Diwali is called the festival of lights not sound. Pollution from crackers hangs in the air for a whole month. We can well celebrate Diwali with sweets, diyas and strings of light,"" said Manju Yagnik of Nahar Builders who drafted children into an awareness rally in a complex a couple of days before Diwali.Another practical problem is that fewer buildings these days have proper compounds or playgrounds. ""Our society in D N Nagar underwent redevelopment four years ago and although we got bigger houses and elevated car parking, we lost the huge playground. Now, our children fear lighting crackers lest they damage property or the sparks enter people's homes,"" said hotelier Arun Shetty.Political parties that once made an impression with fireworks displays now no longer do so. ""Anyway we have anti-noise activists wielding decibel meters trailing our political rallies in open grounds. And why take unnecessary headache and prompt the courts' ire,"" said a senior neta from Prabhadevi./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Very poor' air quality in Delhi on Diwali night,"NEW DELHI: A quiet, smoke-free Thursday gave way to thick haze and noise Diwali night, dashing hopes of a firecracker-free festival following a Supreme Court ban on their sale in the National Capital Region.While quantifying the immediate effect of the ban on firecrackers is difficult, it was a fact that noise and smoke levels Thursday were much lower than in previous years until about 6 pm.Online indicators of the pollution monitoring stations in the Capital glowed red, indicating 'very poor' air quality as the volume of ultra fine particulates PM2.5 and PM10, which enter the respiratory system and manage to reach the bloodstream, sharply rose starting around 7 pm Thursday.Real time pollution data also looked alarming. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee's RK Puram monitoring station recorded PM2.5 and PM10 at 878 and 1,179 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively, at around 11 pm Thursday.The pollutants violated the corresponding 24-hour safe limits of 60 and 100, respectively, by as much as 10 times.According to the SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research), the 24-hour rolling average of PM2.5 and PM10 were 154 and 256 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively, at around 11 pm.SAFAR forecast that the pollution levels will peak between 11 pm and 3 am Thursday night-Friday morning.However, SAFAR has also predicted relatively cleaner post-Diwali air due to favourable meteorological conditions, which are helping prevent the smoke-filled air from the agricultural belt of Haryana and Punjab from entering the Capital. /'Very poor' air quality index (AQI) essentially means that people may suffer from respiratory illnesses on prolonged exposure to such air. If the air quality dips further, AQI will turn 'severe', which may trouble even those who are health and seriously affect those with ailments.The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Prevention and Control Authority is empowered to enforce the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to combat air pollution in Delhi and its surrounding areas.Measures under GRAP's 'very poor' and 'severe' categories, which include a ban on diesel generator sets, came into effect on October 17 and will remain in force until March 15 next year.

India saw 2.5 million deaths due to pollution in 2015: Study,"NEW DELHI: India has topped the list of countries with the most pollution-related deaths in 2015, with 2.5 million mortalities linked to air, water and other types of pollution, a latest report by international journal Lancet shows.It also topped the list of deaths linked to polluted air (1.81 million) and water (0.64 million). The figure of number of deaths due to air pollution, compiled by the Lancet study, is, in fact, over 7,00,000 more than what an another international report, State of Global Air (SGA) 2017, had come out with earlier this year.The SGA 2017 report had put this figure (deaths due to air pollution) for India at 10,90,400 deaths as compared to 11,08,100 in China.The differences in figures of the two reports can be attributed to the different set of data and parameters used by them. The SGA report had taken fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) as a prime measure. The Lancet report, however, is based on data from the Global Burden of Disease study which analysed multiple parameters over two years to arrive at the figures.Accordingly, the Lancet study noted that foul air was linked to 6.5 million deaths worldwide whereas the SGA report put this figure at 4.2 million.According to the Lancet study, released on Thursday, India accounted for about 28% of an estimated nine million pollution-linked deaths worldwide in 2015, highlighting the alarming increase in the burden of diseases as well as mortality from different types of pollution.China follows India on the list, accounting for 1.8 million deaths due to air, water and other types of pollution. /In fact, 92% of pollution-related deaths were reported in low- and middle-income countries, and in rapidly industrialising nations such as India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Madagascar and Kenya, the study said.The Lancet report shows most of these deaths were due to non-communicable diseases caused by pollution, such as heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In fact, pollution is now the largest environmental cause of disease and death in the world, accounting for almost three times more of those than from HIV-AIDS, TB and malaria put together.The Lancet study has also arrived at a financial cost from pollution-related deaths, saying it totalled some $4.6 trillion, which is about 6.2% of the global economy. It says the costs of pollution-related death and disease are highly concentrated in developing regions, equivalent to around 1.3% of the GDP in low-income countries, compared to around 0.5% GDP in high-income countries, and 0.13% GDP globally.Experts say the huge population of countries like India and China and the fact that these are developing economies should also be kept in mind while analysing these statistics. ""There is no denial that mortality from diseases linked with pollution is high in our country. The burden of deaths due to respiratory diseases itself is high, accounting for almost 26% of the total non-communicable diseases, which accounts for 60% of the total deaths in the country,"" a health ministry official said.To tackle the problem, the health ministry had formed two committees - a steering committee and a multi-sectoral group - to analyse the trend and suggest actions to reduce pollution and its impact, as well as measures to strengthen the healthcare system to handle the increasing disease burden linked with pollution.""We have already started taking action based on the recommendations made by the two groups. For instance, we have now included respiratory diseases under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke. We have also allocated funds to states for the same,"" the official said.Among the authors of the study are former environment minister Jairam Ramesh and IIT-Delhi's Prof Mukesh Khare. The report was prepared by the Lancet commission on pollution and health under a two-year project that involved more than 40 international health and environmental authors.The report sees the authors argue that pollution is not the inevitable consequence of economic development, and applying similar legislation and regulation from high-income countries to low- and middle-income countries could help improve and protect health as countries develop./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Govt is sceptical of air pollution-linked deaths data flagged by global studies,"NEW DELHI: A study in the Lancet medical journal has linked huge number of deaths to air pollution in India, but the government has, of late, been sceptical of such studies which often come out with startling numbers.The environment ministry has recently told the Supreme Court that the international reports/studies are very misleading as there is no conclusive evidence to establish a direct correlation of deaths exclusively to air pollution.Senior advocate and amicus curiae in the air pollution matter, Harish Salve, had on October 11 flagged in the apex court the government's affidavit in this regard where the ministry requested that international studies not be cited as a reference to highlight the impact of air pollution.The ministry had submitted the affidavit in response to a comprehensive action plan, prepared by the the Supreme Court appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA).Asked whether such a stand doesn't contradict several government reports which unequivocally spoke about air pollution-linked health hazards in India, an official said, ""We never denied air pollution-linked health hazards, but it's extremely difficult to link those huge number of deaths with toxic air. Different international studies have come out with different figures, using different data from different sources"".The official cited the examples of two global studies of 2017 to substantiate his point. He noted how the State of Global Air 2017, released in February, had put the number of premature deaths due to air pollution in India in 2015 at 1.09 million whereas the Lancet study, released on Thursday, had arrived at the figure of 1.81 million deaths in the same year due to air pollution.""Unless we have our own studies having uniform parameters, we cannot quantify those deaths and link it to specific type of pollution"", he said.The only available report on the air-pollution linked hazards relates to an epidemiological study on ambient air quality and its impact on children in Delhi. /It was brought out by the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata in 2010. It highlighted impact of air pollution on human health, but didn't speak about specific number of deaths in India linked to it. The environment ministry generally avoids sharing details of air pollution-linked deaths, but it had in August 2015 made an exception and told Parliament that more than 35,000 people had died due to acute respiratory infections (ARI) across India in the nine years from January, 2006 to mid-2015.Without directly linking these deaths to air pollution, it had said air pollution in general causes respiratory ailments and may affect lung function. It also noted how it acts as an ""aggravating"" factor for many respiratory ailments and cardiovascular diseases./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Low air pollution in city this Diwali,"PATNA: Fireworks lit up the city skyline on Diwali night while violating noise and pollution norms even though the air pollution level in the state capital was quite low as compared to the previous year.As per data furnished by Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) on Friday, the level of respiratory suspended particulate matter (RSPM) was recorded at 379.72 microgram per cubic metre (\xB5g/m3) of air against 685.97\xB5g/m3 on Diwali night last year. In fact, the RSPM level on Diwali was only slightly higher than on October 12 when it was 327.72\xB5g/m3. Though the RSPM level was comparatively low this Diwali, it was still four times more than the standard 100 micrograms per cubic metre. Suspended particulate matters invade the lungs and triggers respiratory diseases and even cancer.Besides, the level of nitrogen dioxide in the air between 10am and 10pm on Thursday was found to be in the range of 96.35 \xB5g/m3, which was higher than the respective permissible level of 80 \xB5g/m3, but lower than the previous year's level (142.41 \xB5g/m3). The level of sulphur dioxide on Diwali night was recorded at 12.83\xB5g/m3, which was within the permissible level of 80 \xB5g/m3.Nonetheless, BSPCB officials attributed the reason behind comparatively low air pollution level this Diwali to lesser crackers and lower emission by vehicles. /""One of the reasons behind this could be that there has been a drop in bursting of crackers this year as compared to previous years,"" said Birendra Kumar, public relation officer at BSPCB. Apart from the air pollution, the noise level in the city on Diwali was slightly higher than the standard level. The BSPCB report stated that the noise level rose to 82.4dB during 6pm-10pm on Thursday, whereas it is normally recorded at 80.4dB on normal days. On Diwali night, the sound level in the city increased to 81.64dB in the night (10pm to 6am) as compared to 79.2dB on normal days. The BSPCB had reported the noise pollution level at 80.4dB in 2016 between 10pm and midnight.BSPCB furnished details on air and noise pollution using the monitoring of air and noise level through its portable device installed at Boring Road crossing. In order to compare the air and noise pollution level on Diwali day with normal days, BSPCB did the monitor the two parameters on October 12 as well./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
? Awareness reduced pollution levels in Doon this year,"DEHRADUN: Officials of the state pollution control board said that the level of pollution in the city has dipped considerably this Diwali compared to the previous years. Experts attributed the achievement to numerous awareness campaigns and the Supreme Court ruling banning sale of firecrackers./Preliminary survey shows less pollutants in the air in three prime locations in Dehradun — Clock tower, Nehru colony and Raipur road./The highest level of pollution was observed in Nehru colony with 273.44 respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), while the amount of sulphur oxide (SO2) was 26.29. Higher amount of SO2 causes corneal haze, breathing difficulty, airways inflammation, eye irritation, psychic alteration and pulmonary oedema among people with weak immunity. Meanwhile, nitrogen oxide (Nox) level was 28.26 and its inhalation worsens respiratory diseases such as emphysema or bronchitis. In Nehru colony, last year the level of RSPM, SO2 and Nox was 369.9, 28.29 and 31.01 respectively./Raipur road ranked second in pollution with 267.78 RSPM, 26.29 (SO2) and 29.33 (Nox). While SO2 and Nox levels have reduced this year in Raipur road, RSPM has increased by 14 notches in the area. In 2016, Raipur road’s RSPM stood at 253.12 and this year it was at 267.78. SO2 and Nox level was 26.91 and 30.23 respectively in 2016./In 2015, pollution levels were very high in Nehru colony, Raipur road and Clock Tower with 422, 351 and 296 RSPM./S S Rana, regional officer of Uttarakhand state pollution control board, said, “The first report indicates that level of pollution on Diwali has come down by several notches compared to 2016. Although residential areas didn’t show major dip in pollutants, but open areas recorded lesser pollution.”/Clock tower recorded more air pollution due to traffic movement than bursting of firecrackers. Here pollutant levels were 240 RSPM this year while in 2016 it was 166.17 RSPM. The quantity of SO2 and Nox was 24.18 and 27.79 respectively although previous year it was at 26.51 and 29.45 respectively./Officials said that due to increased awareness, air quality remained better and medical experts called it an achievement. Dr K K Tamta, medical superintendent at Government Doon medical college hospital, said, “Social media awareness, the various offline campaigns and the Supreme Court ruling banning sale of firecrackers had a ripple effect on across the country. With decrease in pollution levels, we received less respiratory, anxiety and asthma-related cases during Diwali.”/On one hand when environmentalists were happy, shopkeepers and businessmen put up a grim face. “Usually my sales go up to Rs 2 lakh every year during Diwali but this year I sold only Rs 90,000 worth products. The festive season was suppressed by debates and discussions on protecting the environment. Such things affect our business a lot as we make money only this time of the year.” Kuldeep Rana, a shopkeeper from Krishna Chowk said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Expecting Delhi to follow the cracker ban was a mistake: Delhiites,"Delhi woke up to a blanket of smog on Friday, after a quiet and promising Diwali evening gave way to noisy and relentless bursting of firecrackers till late night on Thursday, despite the Supreme Court ban on their sale in the NCR. The online indicators of the pollution monitoring stations in the city glowed red, indicating a 'very poor' air quality as the volume of ultra fine particulates sharply rose from around 7pm on Diwali.While it is difficult to quantify the immediate effect of the ban on firecrackers, residents across the national capital felt the beginning was promising with neighbourhoods reporting much lesser noise and smoke till about 6pm, compared to the previous years. But as the festivities picked up, the faint echos of crackers started growing louder. SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research) had forecast that the pollution levels will peak between 11pm and 3am. /However, it has also predicted a relatively cleaner post-Diwali air due to favourable meteorological conditions, which are helping prevent the smoke-filled air from the agricultural belt of Haryana and Punjab from entering the national capital.Despite this, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in parts of Delhi touched hazardous, with RK Puram hitting 978 on Friday morning, reported ANI. The real time AQI also showed Punjabi Bagh at 999. Air Pollution in India: Real-time Air Quality Index Visual MapThere was less noise pollution, but people were still lighting crackers: Dheeraj DhooparTV actor Dheeraj Dhoopar, who was at his home in Janakpuri for Diwali, says, ""I had thought that people won't be bursting crackers at all after the Supreme Court ban, but that was not the case. There was less noise because people were not bursting as many bombs, but most people did light phuljharis and chakhris, that contribute to the air pollution. People should understand that the ban was for our own good. Poor air quality impacts all of us and we are making the situation worse by bursting crackers. I also feel that the ban should have been better implemented, only strict checking could have ensured that the ban was a success. Nothing changes easily in Delhi, but at least there is now some awareness among the people.""The ban has certainly made people conscious about bursting crackers: Nila Madhab PandaDelhi-based filmmaker Nila Madhab Panda says, ""People burst crackers this year as well, but I think it was less compared to last year, at least in my area. I live in south Delhi, and when kids were bursting firecrackers nearby, a security guard came and asked them, 'Yeh mana nahin hai?' I could also go jogging the morning after Diwali, unlike last year, when I couldn't step out for four days after the festival because of the smog. The ban has certainly made people more conscious. At least now those who are bursting crackers know that they are doing something wrong. Where was this consciousness before in Delhi? I have been living here for the last 25 years, and a cracker-free Diwali is something unimaginable here.""Bursting crackers on Diwali is a deeply conditioned habit for Delhiites: Adil HussainActor Adil Hussain says, ""Our colony (GK Enclave) was very quiet in the evening, but later, a few families had burst crackers for 1-1.5 hours. I found it an amazing change towards a pollution-free Diwali. Bursting crackers on Diwali is such deeply conditioned habit for Delhiites that it will take time to change. Asking people not to burst crackers on Diwali is like asking a non-vegetarians to turn vegetarian in a day. There needs to be a more intense people's movement.""The ban couldn't stop people from bursting crackers: Danish HussainDanish Hussain, actor and director, says, ""I landed in Delhi at 7am the day after Diwali, and the first thing that I noticed was the smog. My mother lives here and she told me that though people burst less crackers this year, it was still enough to further deteriorate the air quality in Delhi.""Logon to pata tha Diwali ke din police nahi ayegi patakhe band karane: Asha Negi, designer, lives in Sector 37 Noida""What was different this year that nobody burst any crackers before Diwali, every year they start celebrating with crackers a week in advance.

"Delhi didn't have a blast on Diwali, but air turned toxic","NEW DELHI: Delhi tried very hard but it wasn't enough. In the run-up to D-Day, the sound of firecrackers had not been heard. The Supreme Court ban on sales had made procuring them difficult, but many people, including schoolchildren, had resolved to buck tradition for clean air. And till 7 pm on Diwali, most neighbourhoods were quiet. Around that time the first sound of firecrackers going off was heard, and gradually it rose to a crescendo. /But it was nowhere near the blitzkrieg of the past, not even half of that. And well before midnight, it was all over.The bad news broke at dawn. It was a visibly smoggy morning. Air pollution levels had peaked to ""severe"" on Diwali night and remained dangerously high till Friday afternoon as reflected in the real-time monitoring data of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC).The CPCB, however, pointed out a silver lining. It said the air quality index (AQI) this year was better than the ones on Diwali in the past two years in spite of hostile meteorological conditions. On Diwali last year (October 30, 2016), the average AQI for the city was in the ""severe"" category at 426 while the year before that (November 11, 2015), it had been in the ""very poor"" category at 327. This time, it was marginally lower at 326.There are so many factors impacting air quality - from the speed and direction of the wind to burning of crop stubble in neighbouring states - that it is difficult to definitively identify the main culprit. What, however, has to be acknowledged is that at least a majority of people have the will to stick to what may appear to be unpalatable decisions for better quality of life.The data, however, is making informed observers worry - particularly the massive peaks in PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) and PM 10 (coarse pollution particles) levels on Thursday night after 10 pm. Hourly PM 2.5 data recorded by DPCC at some of its new monitoring stations show levels peaked to more than 33 times the national 24-hour safe standard at some locations. Data accessed by TOI shows, for example, that PM 2.5 ranged from 1000 to 2000 micrograms per cubic metres at Jahangirpuri between 10 pm and midnight, but the 24-hour average here between 6 am on October 19 and 5 am on October 20 was 449 micrograms per cubic metres, 7.4 times the standard. Similarly, between 10 pm and 5 am on Friday, PM 2.5 concentrations near Satyawati College ranged from 710 micrograms per cubic metres to 2881 micrograms per cubic metres, 11 to 48 times the standard.DPCC's report also shows that concentrations were extremely high with only a minor drop in the range. On Diwali day, the 24-hour average for PM 2.5 ranged from 154 micrograms per cubic metres to 440 micrograms per cubic metres. The minimum average value was seen at Civil Lines and the maximum at R K Puram. The previous year, the 24-hour average for PM 2.5 on Diwali day ranged from 180 micrograms per cubic metres to 440 micrograms per cubic metres. Ghaziabad recorded massive peaks of up to 953 micrograms per cubic metres around 10 pm while Delhi peaked to 656 micrograms per cubic metres around midnight.Because of such high levels, some websites showed AQI at 999 at some locations, indicating that levels had gone out of the AQI charts. ""The ban was not effective and the data is out there. It is a complete implementation failure. Courts are passing orders now but these will not make a dent without structural changes which ensure implementation of these orders,"" said Aishwarya Sudhir, air pollution researcher, who was shocked to see real-time AQI going off the charts despite the cracker ban.However, the data also shows that in spite of unfavourable meteorological conditions, the air quality on Diwali this year was better than last year. It had not been so good in the two days preceding Diwali due to intrusion of humid air from the south-east coupled with prevailing calm wind conditions. The average mixing height (the height to which smoke or air will rise, mix and disperse) recorded on October 18 and 19 were 547 metres and 481 metres, respectively, according to CPCB. ""It should be at least 1000 metres for proper dispersal. Despite unfavourable weather, our manual monitoring data is showing that this is the best Diwali in Delhi in four years. I am sure there has been a reduction in use of smoke-emitting firecrackers,"" said Dipankar Saha, head of the air lab at CPCB.Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has also raised an alarm. It said air quality data from 13 monitoring stations of CPCB, DPCC and IMD shows that from being in the ""very poor"" category during the day, it hit the ""emergency"" level by night. ""The 24-hour average level of PM 2.5 during Diwali and the morning after (12 pm - 12 am, October 19-20) was 397 micrograms per cubic metre (mg/cu m). This is 6.6 times higher than the standard and is at the ""emergency"" level. This is more than two times higher than the level a day before when the 24-hour average was 184 microgram per cubic metre,"" CSE said in its statement.It highlighted that the night-time pollution in Delhi and NCR towns has been three to four times higher than day-time pollution on Diwali day. During the day (about 13-hour average - 6 am to 7 pm), the levels in Delhi, Gurgaon and Ghaziabad were in ""very poor"" category (Delhi -- 139 micrograms per cubic metres; Gurgaon -- 121 micrograms per cubic metres; and Ghaziabad -- 142 micrograms per cubic metres). However, during Diwali night (about 12 hour average - 7pm to 7am, the levels in Delhi, Gurgaon and Ghaziabad were in the emergency zone. (Delhi -- 548 micrograms per cubic metres; Gurgaon - 382 micrograms per cubic metres; and Ghaziabad - 501 micrograms per cubic metres.""It is clear that the Delhi-NCR region requires long-term and systemic action rather than a one-off ban,"" said CSE executive director Anumita Roy Chowdhury. ""Supreme Court has already ordered a phased strategy with the help of regulation of chemicals, standards, reduced quantum of crackers, controlled-bursting of crackers through community events, locational controls etc. This must be implemented without delay.""The sulphur dioxide (SO2) levels that otherwise remain very low in NCR increased by more than three times at several locations, including RK Puram, Shadipur and Punjabi Bagh. In the days preceding Diwali (October 17-18), SO2 levels in Delhi were less than 50 micrograms per cubic metres. But on Diwali night, the hourly levels increased alarmingly to 183 micrograms per cubic metres. ""This is a direct indicator of the impact of Diwali crackers,"" said the CSE statement./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Sparkling Diwali leaves Chennai gasping,"The city air was four times more polluted this Diwali compared to the last. At Sowcarpet, the worst-affected locality, the pollution levels were nearly eight times higher than the permissible limit.As residents set off fireworks on Wednesday evening, a dense cloud of smoke hung above the city for hours, raising risks of respiratory ailments.Data released by the State Pollution Control Board on Thursday showed that there has been an acute increase in pollution this year, with experts citing a change in climatic conditions for the deterioration in air quality .IIT Madras associate professor in civil engineering S M Shiva Nagendra said it was raining for three days during and after Diwali last year, which helped wash away pollutants from residential areas, due to which the ambient air quality was not as bad.This year, it was drizzling until noon on the day of Diwali but the weather subsequently improved. This led to more people bursting crackers, resulting in increased pollution levels in the city from the afternoon.""The change in meteorological conditions is one of the major causes for the higher levels this time around,"" said Shiva Nagendra. The PM10 level in Triplicane, which was 177 on Diwali last year, rose to 597 this year -a three-fold increase.Similarly in Sowcarpet, the PM 10 stood at 178 last year but soared four-fold to 777 this year, according to pollution control board data. /The National Air Quality Monitoring Programme's pre scribed PM 10 standard is 100.At Triplicane, compared to a regular day, the PM10 level rose by 12 times, while at Nungambakkam it rose by 11 times on Wednesday .Pollution control board member secretary N Sundara Gopal said in a release that levels of gaseous pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide on Diwali were found to be well within the prescribed standard of 80 micrograms per cubic metre of air. Due to climatic conditions, there was no dispersion of particulate matter pollut ants, leading to a higher value of PM10, he said.Environmental activist Nityanand Jayaraman said although the noise pollution had not varied significantly compared to last year, air pollution this year reached hazardous levels across the city .The PM10 data is across a 24hour period and did not indicate pollution levels during the peak hours of 6pm to 10pm, he said.During this period, the levels could have exceeded 1,000 micrograms per cubic metre, he charged.City goes breathlessCity doctors reported a 50% increase in number of patients with respiratory ailments since Tuesday.Pulmonologist Dr S Jayaraman of Sri Jayam Chest and Sleep Clinic, who usually receives five to ten patients a day, had to treat about 20 patients daily this week. ""There has been a dramatic increase in the number of cases of allergic bronchitis, allergic rhinitis and allergic sinusitis this Diwali,"" he said.Chennai gaspingThe last image Hari Kumar, an autorick shaw driver from Sholinganallur, remembers before he lost consciousness was the alarm on his nine-year-old son's face when he realised the firecracker in his hand was lit.The father of three let out a bloodcurdling yell and dived for the explosive. Three hours later, he woke up in a hospital bed with a bandaged hand. Or what was left of it.Only one finger survived.""The rest were blown out,"" said Dr G Karthikeyan, associate professor, department of burns, plastic and reconstructive surgery at Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH).Seven of the 27 bones in his left palm are completely shattered. ""We can reconstruct his thumb and hope to salvage his little finger,"" said the doctor, adding that the impact could have been much worse if Kumar's son was the victim.Although the overall number of bur ns patients in KMCH -the state's nodal centre for such cases -has come down this Diwali, doc tors are still concerned about people like Kumar reporting with `burst hand', treatment of which involves grafting skin from the abdomen and a toe to replace the lost finger.""We can't restore 100% functionality in most cases,"" said Dr Nirmala Ponnambalam, head of the department.Until late on Thursday, 39 people reported to KMCH with injuries related to firecracker accidents. Besides Kumar, two other children, both below 15 years, were admitted with some of their fingers ripped out because of the impact of the burst. Almost all the patients who suffer `hand bursts' lose a thumb -which performs 40% of the functions of a hand.The rest of the patients, who continued to trickle into KMCH a day after Diwali, had injuries on their faces, hands and legs. Dr Ponnambalam said most of the patients this time were in the 8-12 years age group. ""We usually get cases for up to a week after Diwali,"" she said.Most private hospitals TOI spoke to said they had fewer burns cases this year. ""We usually see at least six cases a year. This time, we saw only two -one with a burst hand, the other with an eye injury,"" said Dr A Dhavapalani, head of the emergency department, Apollo Hospitals.The state-run emergency ambulance service 108, however, recorded a rise in calls compared to previous years.""We attended to around 4,400 people across the state.Most of these pertained to accidents, breathing difficulties and abdominal pain,"" said an official in the health department./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
HC restrictions on crackers help Punjab do better on Diwali,"Patiala: The Punjab and Haryana high court-imposed resrictions on the sale and bursting of firecrackers went up in smoke this Diwali. A day after the festival, Punjab State Pollution Control Board said on Friday that there was a 24% increase in air pollution in the state on Diwali and particulate matter shot up to hazardous levels.Compared to previous year, though, Punab did better. In 2016, pollution rose by 70%, according to the board. /To reach the conclusion, PPCB analaysed data recorded at three monitoring stations in Punjab - at Amritsar, Ludhiana and Mandi Gobindgarh. Particulate matter PM10, which is hazardous if it is above 50 microgram/m3 (?g/m3) for a 24-hour period, was found to be 346?g/m3 in Amritsar, 412?g/m3 in Ludhiana, and 278?g/m3 in Mandi Gobindgarh.Particulate matter PM 2.5, whose healthy levels are under 25 ?g/m3, was 346 in Amritsar, 433 in Ludhiana, and 336 in Mandi Gobindgarh.PPCB chairperson K S Pannu said the level of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) was higher this year than the previous Diwali because of the low level of air dispersion due to ""very low wind velocity"" and early harvesting of paddy crop. He said data suggested that HC restrictions bore fruit as pollution from bursting crackers remained low. He said incidents of burning paddy straw had also increased suddenly in the last two days. On Diwali, he said, 1,188 cases of stubble burning were recorded, compared to an average of 400 per day before the festival.PPCB said the percentage increase in Air Quality Index (AQI) in Mandi Gobindgarh was 17% this year, compared to 163% last year. In Ludhiana, AQI was 24% this year, compared to 50% last year. Amritsar's percentage increase in AQI was 45%, against 63% in 2016.

"Fire crackers ban in NCR: Responsibility for clean air lies on all, says ASSOCHAM","MANGALURU: Expressing concern over poor implementation of the Supreme Court ban order on sale of fire crackers in the Delhi-NCR, the ASSOCHAM on Saturday said ensuring a clean environment should be a combined responsibility of the Centre, state governments, civil society and public at large and not of the apex court alone.""The economic interest of the traders and the manufacturers was involved; but once the Supreme Court had banned sale of fire crackers, the enforcement of the order should have been ensured by the Union Environment Ministry, Delhi government, state governments of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana in the entire national capital region,"" the ASSOCHAM Secretary General D S Rawat said.Though there was a voluntary compliance in the select areas, the ban was largely defied through sale of fire crackers on the sly inside the localities, with the result that though the damage to the environment this year was less than the previous few years, the air pollution in the NCR was still 18 times the limit allowed. The levels of PM 2.5 had risen, though there was a consolation of slightly less damage.""Learning from the experience this year, there is a need for a well-coordinated action plan to control the air pollution not only during Diwali but throughout the year, more so during the winter when the sky is overcast with haze and toxic gases, severely damaging the health of millions of people, particularly the children,"" the chamber said.The public at large has to be involved much more vigorously and the message must go home about the ill effects of toxic fire crackers. /""In fact, the entire government machinery should prepare an action plan in consultation with the civil society, traders, crackers manufacturers. The festivities can be rejoiced without burning the damaging fire crackers; crackers with less pollutants can be manufactured with technological support to the manufacturers"". This action plan should be presented before the apex court along with the National Green Tribunal.This is no reason why a pragmatic win-win solution cannot be found. As far as possible, the last minute situations should be avoided so that any move to clean pollution has a larger support of public and policy makers, the chamber said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Day after Diwali, quality of air drops to very poor level","Pune: The air quality in the city was 'moderate' on Diwali day (Thursday). It, however, fell under the 'very poor' category within a span of 24 hours on Friday.This was revealed by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar) data, which was released on Saturday.""On Diwali day, Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5 was recorded to be 82.75\xB5g/m3 that falls under the moderate category of Air Quality Index (AQI). A day after, it was recorded to be 138.59 \xB5g/m3 that falls under 'very poor' category of AQI,"" an official statement issued by Safar stated.Experts at Safar said the 2\xB0C drop in the minimum temperature as compared to previous days along with calm winds resulted in the accumulation of pollutants emitted from firecrackers. The highest levels of PM10 and PM2.5 were recorded between 10pm to 3am on the intervening night of October 19 and 20.The maximum permissible limit of PM2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic metre of air (ug/m3). Gufran Beig, project director of Safar at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said, ""The particulate matter was lesser compared to that on Diwali day last year. Pashan normally has a lower PM2.5 level. /It is because the areas has a lush green cover, which automatically reduces the pollution. Generally, Hadapasar and Shivajinagar have the worst particulate matter levels. However, this time around, Katraj has topped the list. This place is also highly populated and there are campuses in the area.""Safar said the air quality will further improve from Sunday. ""Last year, there was a steep decrease in particulate matter two days after Diwali because of heavy wind. But this time, winds were calm, hence the particulate matter got accumulated post-Diwali. By Sunday, the quality should improve,"" Beig said.Following Katraj, the most polluted areas in the city on Diwali day were Shivajinagar, Hadapasar, Lohegaon, Bhumkar Chowk, Alandi, Bhosari, Nigdi, Manjri and the least polluted was Pashan.As per the data of Safar, the air pollution in the city during Diwali festivities was at its worst since 2013. Safar scientists found the air quality index high on October 30, 31 and November 1 last year, the main days of the festival.A study for the period between 2013 and 2016 showed that there was maximum emission of smoke from the use of fire crackers on Laxmi Puja day and a day after. Last year, a nip in the air added to the pollution.If the air quality index is between 201-300, it is categorized as poor and if it is between 301-400, it is considered very poor, indicating health risks for people sensitive to air pollution.The PM 2.5 and PM 10 (coarser particles) levels for Mumbai were also on the higher side last year, touching 145.9 as against 60 microgrammes per cubic meter./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Smog, soot and sulphur fumes: Diwali revelry chokes Vizag","Diwali is supposed to be the festival of lights. But in Vizag this year, it could very well have been dubbed the 'festival of smoke'. The twinkling lights that shimmered all over the city were reduced to a mere dim glimmer, as a thick blanket of smoke covered the city sky early as 10 pm. Even on Friday morning, smog hung heavy over the city and the stale stench of sulphur was inescapable. ""What have we done?/ Reduced Diwali to a sound and smoke fest?"" laments Vishnu Teja, an environmentalist, who is visibly pained by the smog blanket that masks the city. ""Air and noise pollution levels have reached a record level this Diwali. What are we aiming to become? Another Delhi or Chennai - both of which are already facing the impact of poor air quality?"" he asks.A resident of Poorna Market, DS Trinadh Rao admits that the air pollution in his area is so severe that it has turned him, a lover of fireworks, to rethink this kind of mindless celebration. ""You could easily tell that this year the pollution was more than the last two years. I could feel the pollutants on my skin; the air was so thick with the stench of crackers and so full of particles that it was suffocating to breathe. The lanes of this area are very narrow, and all that smog has no place to escape to. We are still covered in a blanket of smoke. I am one of those who believed that Diwali is nothing without crackers, but this is a saddening sight to see. We were better off two years ago when we decided to forego crackers after Hudhud.""In 2014, Diwali came close on the heels of cyclone Hudhud that had left in its wake a destructed city covered with debris. Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu had banned sale of firecrackers back then, appealing to the people to keep their celebrations cracker-free in order to avoid untoward incidents. And the people heeded his call. Surprisingly, the sober style of celebration with more lights and less sound continued into 2015 and 2016 as well. But Vizagites seemed to have gone all out this year. Fireworks stalls put up at the sports grounds and numerous function halls in the city had been jam packed for two days prior to Diwali. A lot of Vizagites proudly said that they were opting for 'Made in India' crackers, and foregoing the Chinese ones. ""Yes, ever since Hudhud, we hadn't really felt like bursting crackers. At the most, we'd buy sparklers and be done with it. But this year, we went all out and bought everything from flower pots to pinwheel rockets, 1000 walas and shots, because I wanted my kids to have some fun this year! But we bought only India-made crackers,"" admits Shalini Reddy. Fun it must have been for a few hours, but as of 4 pm on Diwali evening, the Central Pollution Control Board had termed the pollution level in Vizag as 'moderate' which indicates ""breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases."" ""But that's not the only cause for worry. The noise levels emitted by firecrackers reach up to 150 decibels on an average - that is 20 decibels higher than the limit permitted by WHO (World Health Organisation). The chances of permanent disability and impairment of auditory senses is taken very casually during Diwali for some reason. Another facet that's ignored is the mental health of people. The noise and apprehension could lead to hyperventilation and serious, life-threatening consequences in people dealing with mental health issues. It is unfortunate that this issue is not taken into account when deliberating on the negative effects of bursting firecrackers,"" points out Vishnu. Having experienced the highs of celebrating a lowkey yet lovely Diwali sans sound this year, Aakhil Matta, a BA LLB student from the city says, ""Being a part of a joint family consisting of fifteen people, we always enjoyed Diwali together by bursting crackers. But after forgoing crackers post Hudhud, my cousins and I realised that we could have fun even without noisy, polluting fireworks. Ever since, we celebrate by lighting lanterns and diyas. A movie and dinner is any day a better way to spend a festival than polluting the city. I feel like I'm doing my part as a responsible human and protecting our earth and our city from pollution. I wish other people too realise the same and we that we don't have a repeat of this year's Diwali disaster.""Colourful fireworks are the most polluting""This year the PM 2.5 values are increased when compared to last year. While the quantity of crackers sold are expected to be less, the pollution is more due to use of heavy metals composition like copper, barium, aluminium, sodium, strontium, dextrin and more. These pollutants are what make crackers colourful. They can cause cause cancer, apart from other severe health problems. Earlier, crackers were made using like chemicals like sulphur. But now, heavy metals are added to make them attractive."" - R Lakshmi Narayana, environmental engineer, APPCB/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Bhiwadi beats Kolkata, Agra; was most polluted city on Diwali day","Alwar: Rajasthan's Bhiwadi, which is infamous for its smoke-emitting industries, has now has got the dubious distinction of being the most polluted city in the country.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) issued a report on Diwali mentioning ambient air quality which has revealed pollution level in different cities of the country.Bhiwadi situated in Alwar, which falls in Delhi-NCR, was rated as the most polluted city. Kolkata occupies the second spot, while Agra is the third most polluted city of the country.In 2016, Agra was the most polluted city. The increasing air pollution in Bhiwadi is attributed to industries emitting harmful smoke. /On Diwali, the situation worsened. On October 19, CPCB had issued a report on Air Quality Index (AQI), which shows that the level of pollution in Bhiwadi was 425 micrograms per cubic metre. Kolkata has 358 micrograms per cubic metre while Agra recorded 332 micrograms per cubic metre of air pollution. It is to be noted that ahead of Diwali even Supreme Court had expressed its concern on increasing levels of pollution in Delhi and imposed a ban on sale of crackers.Despite all the measures, Bhiwadi was adjudged as the city with the highest pollution.In the past too, concerned over the increasing levels of pollution in Bhiwadi, the National Green Tribunal had closed down factories causing pollution. But, alarmingly, even now the pollution levels are rising.Now, the effect of pollution is clearly evident on the health of the people. On Diwali, specialists in respiratory diseases and pulmonologists witnessed an increase in the number of patients coming for treatment.Doctors claimed that due to rise in pollution levels on Diwali in Bhiwadi, more patients with respiratory problems are coming for treatment.In such a situation, people vulnerable to respiratory diseases should take precautions like wearing masks.

"In Hyderabad's dumpyard hinterland, groundwater not fit to drink","HYDERABAD:Over 4,700 metric tonnes of the city's garbage that Jawaharnagar dumping yard gets everyday has been causing untold suffering to locals, both through seepage resulting in contamination of groundwater and also due to air pollution in the colonies located in a radius of five to six kilometre up to Sainikpuri and AS Rao Nagar. A recent study, published in the 'Applied Water Sciences' journal, revealed the groundwater in the vicinity of Jawaharnagar has been contaminated.Osmania University department of environmental sciences researchers Syed Azeem Unnisa and Shaik Zainab Bi in their research paper 'Groundwater Quality Characterisation Around Jawaharnagar Open Dumpsite, Telangana State' revealed the pollution levels. Groundwater samples were collected during the dry and wet period from May 2015 to May 2016 around the dumpsite. /Samples were collected from Malkaram, Haridaspally, Balajinagar, Ahmedguda, Cheeryal, Kundanpally, Rampally, Dammaiguda, EC Nagar and Vasavinagar.""The moderately high concentration of total dissolved solids, magnesium, calcium, chlorine, sulfate and flourine of groundwater in Jawaharnagar indicate contamination and above the permissible limits of drinking water standards. Groundwater samples were found to be not potable,"" the researchers said. Locals alleged the city's waste is dumped at Jawaharnagar instead of areawise sites being created. S Hari Goud of Dammaiguda said, ""From Barkas to Patancheru and from far off areas, solid waste and garbage is dumped here. It is gross injustice done to lakhs of people living in and around Jawaharnagar. Air pollution and groundwater pollution is a serious issue. Skin diseases and respiratory problems are more common among residents here. We are not eating the rice grown in the fields around.""GHMC additional commissioner (sanitation) Ravi Kiran told TOI, ""In an unprecedented way during the recent rains, leachate problem has spread to several colonies and villages around. We have arranged a mobile treatment plant with RO technology for treating leachate. Only after testing the treated water will it be released. Capping of an old dump is another big issue. We are doing profiling, and initially, we will do soil cover and then cap it. Villages like Cheryal and Yadagarapally are the worst hit.""GHMC solid waste management superintending engineer Koteswara Rao said, ""From 1995 to 2012, solid waste was not treated, and can't be treated now, and has been producing leachate. Only capping is the solution. We also requested the irrigation department to add Malkaram lake, which has turned into a leachate pond, in Mission Kakatiya."" PCB officials said they received complaints regarding air pollution from Rajiv Gruha Kalpa. A review was conducted and Ramky and GHMC were asked to control the stench and take up capping work of the old dump. Locals also complained about animal waste being dumped from a nearby abattoir./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Waste burnt all night on Huda plot near pvt varsity,"GURGAON: Despite so much talk about air pollution all around, both MCG and Huda don't seem to care. Even as residents continue to suffer due to garbage burning, the two civic agencies are busy passing the buck.On Friday night, residents of Sector 23A, were forced to spend a sleepless night as they gasped and choked, their eyes burning with toxic fumes due to burning of waste on a vacant land that is spread over three acres near The Northcap University in the sector.The land belongs to Huda, but its administrator Yashpal Yadav said MCG was responsible for the maintenance and removal of garbage from the land and to ensure that no waste is burnt. The MCG, however, refuted the claims and said it was not their responsiblity. /MCG senior sanitary inspector Ambika Prasad claimed that construction and demolition waste has been lying on the plot for several years and it is Huda's job to clear the construction waste lying around.Residents, who have had enough of this squabbles, have written to the chief minister as a last resort.""The three acre vacant plot has been made into a waste dumping site by residents of unauthorised colonies, village, and the hotels around the sector. We were forced to spend a sleepless night and smoke can be seen even after 12 hours since the waste started burning. Both MCG and Huda are endangering our lives. Despite repeated requests, MCG continues to ignore this problem. They say this plot belongs to Huda and it is their responsibility,"" said RWA general secretary Bhawani Shankar Tripathy. ""Due to this deliberate negligence, residents are suffering from life-threatening conditions, especially the elderly, children and those with breathing problems. This is like a criminal offence, as it is a deliberate ignorance on the part of the Gurgaon administration,"" added Triprathy./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Cidco warns illegal brick kiln operators to shut shop,"NAVI MUMBAI: Cidco seems to have finally taken a note of complaints from residents in south Navi Mumbai and warned brick kiln operators from operating in the residential areas falling mostly under PCMC jurisdiction.The brick kiln operators have been asked to immediately stop activities in compliance with a high court directive aimed at curbing pollution. Cidco has revealed that all brick kilns in residential areas like Kharghar, Taloja, Kopra, Kamothe, New Panvel and Karanjade are illegal and have been operating without its permission.The town planning body had chalked out a plan to crack the whip on these brick kilns before the festival season but lack of police protection forced Cidco to defer its plans. The police force has been busy with FIFA World Cup and festival duty. /Over 40 illegal brick kilns allegedly operate in these nodes. Toxic gases emitting from these kilns have been adding to pollution, Cidco officials said.""We have received a number of complaints. Individual notices citing court directives for closure of all illegal brick kilns have been issued earlier. Besides, we have given a public notice in the newspapers warning of stern action against such operators. However, due to FIFA World Cup we have failed to get police protection and this is why we will step up action once the event is over,"" assistant controller of unauthorised constructions, Cidco, S R Rathod said.Last year, residents had launched an online petition and submitted the same to various government agencies, voicing their strong concern about the brick kilns causing air pollution. The thick smoke from these kilns has been leading to serious health risks for children and elderly people in particular. ""Residents are feeling the pinch of rampant pollution due to the thick cover of smokes. Both PCMC and Cidco have been informed about the menace,"" said Suraj Srinivasan, a Kharghar resident.Residents have even questioned how can the city dream of a being a Smart City when its air is so polluted. Many brick kilns have surfaced near Taloja Jail and around sector 34 and 35 in Kharghar besides Kopra.Earlier this year, both PCMC and Cidco in separate drives had cleared over two dozens of brick kilns in Karanjade, Kharghar, Kopra and Kamothe amidst protests. ""If brick kiln operators fail to comply with the public notice we will pull down their base. Cidco will not be held responsible for any damage,"" said an official from Cidco's anti-encroachment wing./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Post-Diwali, Nagpur's AQI drops to 156 from 192, still second-most polluted in state","Nagpur: Despite the Diwali celebrations being a low-key affair in the city, the air quality index (AQI) in the intervening night of Friday and Saturday was 156. Though it was an improvement from 192 on Friday, Nagpur was still the second-most polluted city among those beingmonitored in Maharashtra.Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Aurangabad, Chandrapur, Nashik and Solapur are the the other citries being monitored by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). However, on both the days, the city's air quality remained in the 'moderate' zone in which breathing discomfort is caused to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. While residents maintained that the volume of fireworks was very low on the next day of Diwali, the air quality began to worsen at midnight. Around midnight, particulate matter PM10, whose 24-hour safe limit is 100 micrograms per cubic meter (mpcm), was recorded 425-434 mpcm, fourt times the permissible limit. /As per experts, particulates PM10 and PM2.5 enter the respiratory system and reportedly cause severe respiratory and other health problems.PS Rao, senior principal scientist and head of air pollution control division at National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri), said that high pollution was because of changing meteorological conditions post midnight. ""At night when temperature drops, the mixing height in the atmosphere decreases. This means that the pollutants do not get to disperse or dilute in the night. The mixing height is at its peak in the afternoon,"" added Rao.As per the monitoring done by CPCB, Mumbai's air was cleaner than Nagpur on Saturday. By afternoon, the state capital recorded an AQI of 110 against previous afternoon's 248. Even at night hours, the level of particulate matter did not enter the 'severe' zone. According to experts, Mumbai has an advantage of ""good wind velocity."" Rao said, ""Being surrounded by seas, Mumbai's wind velocity is higher than Nagpur. Wind plays an important role in controlling pollution.""Like Friday, Navi Mumbai continued to be the cleanest among all monitored locations. By Saturday afternoon, its AQI was 88 - probably the only location to come under the 'satisfactory' zone. Like Nagpur, Aurangabad and Nashik too saw a rise in pollution between 12-2am during which the particulates entered the 'poor' and 'very poor' zone. Pune, whose AQI was 157 on Friday, went down to 153 on Saturday./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Deepavali pollution: Bengalureans reeling under the aftereffects,"Thanks to the ban on firecrackers in the national capital, the many awareness campaigns in the city and the general talk about the already high pollution levels, many Bengalureans thought that this Deepavali would be different. They hoped that city folk would stick to lighting diyas and keep away from noisy and polluting firecrackers. But this was not to be. /Firecrackers as a means to mark the festival of lights (light, being the operative word here), not only resulted in injuries from bursting them, but also in people across the city falling ill thanks to the smoke they emit. And it is not just human beings that have suffered; animals bear a bigger brunt. Being sensitive to sound, the loud noise scares them and many pets go missing as a result.A HEAVY HEART AND STUFFY NOSEPriyanka Joshua, a resident of a large apartment complex in Begur, was happy on the first day of Deepavali (October 18), since she hardly heard any firecrackers, but all that changed the next day. ""I was happy thinking that better sense had prevailed this year, but apparently not. On Thursday, people in my apartment complex burst firecrackers non-stop between 7.30 pm and 10 pm. That may not seem like very long, but the damage was done. Breathing in that smoke (which made its way into the house even though all windows and doors were tightly shut), made me and my 72-year-old mother ill; we are yet to recover. My mother has a bad cough and I am down with a bad cold and throat. We were both fine till Thursday,"" she stresses. Jayanagar-resident Indira Joshi, 67, a heart patient, had a similar fate. After the rains last month, she was relieved that the skies had cleared up, as that meant that she could finally breathe easy. But that changed during Deepavali. ""I suddenly fell ill and was weak. My doctor told me that it was because of the breathing difficulties I was facing due to the rise in pollution levels as a result of bursting firecrackers,"" she says, adding that breathing difficulties directly affect her heart. SICK WITH WORRYShobha Satish, a resident of Jayanagar, has also been sick - sick with worry. On Thursday, her 10-month-old Mudhol Hound, Rudra, went missing. ""This was Rudra's first Deepavali, so he was extremely afraid when people began bursting firecrackers. At around 7.30 pm on Thursday (October 19), he jumped the compound wall and ran away in fear. By the time we realized that Rudra wasn't around, it was too late and we couldn't trace him. Some people say that he was kidnapped once people saw him running on the road. We have approached the police and put up pictures on social media, appealing to everyone to contact us if they find him. We are all extremely worried; I just hope he's safe,"" says Shobha, hoping that she hears news of her beloved Rudra's whereabouts soon.AIR POLLUTION UP BY NEARLY 50%The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board confirmed that pollution levels had shot up during Deepavali - a rise of a whopping 46.8%.

"At this decibel rate, the city may soon go deaf","Jaipur: It was not only air pollution that was alarmingly high in Jaipur during Diwali, but noise pollution too reached an all-time record in most zones in the city.The entire city was exposed to almost double the level of permitted decibel sound on October 19 during both day and night. The decibel levels measured by the Rajasthan Pollution Control Board (RPCB) says that the worst-affected were silent zones-Civil Lines and Santokba Durlabji Hospital (SDM) zones. Both these zones registered 77.9 and 84.7 decibels, respectively, against the standard 40, says RPCB which released the report on Wednesday.The RPCB measures noise pollution at six zones with two each in silent, commercial and residential categories. While Civil Lines and SDM are silent zones, Mansarovar and Raja Park are in the commercial category, and Jawahar Nagar and Gandhi Nagar in the residential category.The Chauti Chaupar zone, which covers most of the Walled City area, has been omitted this year due to the ongoing construction of the Metro line.Noise pollution levels have risen from previous years, exposing the slew of efforts claimed by different agencies of the state to reduce the same. /Firecrackers have been blamed for high decibel levels along with loud music played at several places on Diwali. RPCB officials, however, claimed that the noise pollution was not restricted to Diwali, Ganpati festival or Muharram. ""It's becoming a daily affair,"" says a RPCB official.Dr Tarun Ojha, ENT head of a private medical college in the city, said, ""I received at least seven cases during Diwali facing difficulties in hearing due to acoustic trauma caused by loud sound of crackers. Two of them have suffered from sensorineural hearing loss. Now, it's difficult for them to recover. Exposure to sudden single sound of more than 140 decibels causes damages to ear drums. If it damages the cochlear, then it's not possible to repair the same.""The high decibel sound in silent zones is a cause of concern, feel experts. It goes on unabated despite laws in place under the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000. It clearly states that, ""no horn shall be used in silent zones or during night time in residential areas except during a public emergency"". Hospitals, schools and verified government buildings fall under the category of silent zones. It also has the provision to prosecute offenders. A complaint can be filed at the police station.The rules also define the role of state as a competent body to take, ""measures for abatement of noise, including noise emanating from vehicular movements, blowing of horns, bursting of sound emitting firecrackers, use of loudspeakers or public address system and sound producing instruments and ensure that the existing noise levels do not exceed the ambient air quality standards specified"". Several reports have estimated that almost 6% Indians suffer from hearing loss. It also says that the continuous exposure of noise above 60 decibels is harmful not only for hearing but also causes serious health problems-deafness, sleep disorders, etc.As per a report, one kg of crackers burns 2kg of oxygen to release toxic gases. These include nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, CO2 and heavy metal oxides. ""These are harmful and can aggravate respiratory diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, COPD, etc., even in healthy persons. Cracker fumes are dangerous for the old. During the last 3-4 days, I have across dozens of patients whose respiratory condition have worsened with cracker pollution,"" says Dr Virendra Singh, former superintendent and respiratory diseases specialist, Sawai Man Singh Hospital.What made the situation worse is the high air pollution level of 496 index value, measured in 'Particle Matter 10' (particles smaller than 10 microns), recorded in VKIA area followed by the densely-polluted Chandpole area with an index value of 483 PM10, as per figures released by the pollution control board.Times ViewJaipur is quickly progressing towards becoming a 'noisy city'. Both the administration and civil society, the two main stakeholders, have been callous and turned a blind eye to the rising noise pollution which is gradually turning into a health hazard. The administration can take a slew of measures under the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000 and prosecute offenders. But action has been selective or rare. In the absence of awareness drives, the civil society tolerates noise pollution of all sorts from their backyard to the roads. The state has to take the citizens along and launch mass awareness campaigns to fight the menace. The figures released by the Rajasthan Pollution Control Board (RPCB), which shows all the six zones of having registered high decibel levels, are ominous for the city./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"City air a tad better, NCR gasps for breath","NEW DELHI: Capital's air quality slightly improved on Thursday with the index recording 321, but it continued to be in the 'very poor' category. But neighbouring cities like Ghaziabad and Faridabad were the most polluted ones in NCR with air quality being in the 'severe' category. /But experts from Regional Weather Forecasting Centre said weather conditions were likely to help in trapping pollutants locally. ""The easterlies are already here and they have high moisture content. This means that particulate matter does not disperse easily. We are yet to see the effect of winds from Punjab but easterlies are already causing misty conditions in the morning, which can trap emissions and dust and leave hazy conditions till mid-day,"" said Kuldeep Shrivastav, scientist at RWFC.Elsewhere in Gurgaon, a resident of a housing society in Sector 48 wrote to the Haryana chief minister's office on Thursday, seeking his intervention to stop open burning of waste across the city.

He spotted a number of places where waste burning was rampant and asked us to enforce the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ban.""The district pollution board said it was taking these steps. ""Between October 12 and 18, we fined and sealed 12 polluting industries while action was taken against four builders for dumping construction waste flouting NGT norms,"" said Sharma. ""In addition, we have recommended to the UPPCB for closure of the Carbon Continental factory near Crossings Republik along NH-24 after it was found to be flouting pollution norms,"" he added.Ghaziabad has been listed by the Central Pollution Control Board as one of the biggest polluters, with PM10 hovering over 400 micrograms per cubic metre, four times above the safe level, for the past few days.Sapna Srivastava, scientific officer at the state pollution board, said a more analytical approach ""is the need of the hour to really understand the problem"". Referring to a survey done by IIT-Kanpur last year for the Delhi region on various sources of pollution, Srivastava said, ""According to the report, road dust accounts for 38% of pollution in Delhi, followed by vehicular pollution, which comes to around 20%, which I think holds true for Ghaziabad as well to a large extent.""""Now if road dust has been identified as the primary source of pollution, we along with the civic and development agencies should come up with a comprehensive plan to tackle this issue,"" she added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Action against farmers no solution to check husk burning, SC told","New Delhi: Husk burning in Punjab and Haryana is a ""huge problem"" causing pollution in and around Delhi but taking punitive action against the farmers was not a solution to resolve the issue, the Supreme Court was told on Friday.Arguing before a bench of Justices M B Lokur and Deepak Gupta, senior advocate Harish Salve, assisting the court as an amicus curiae in the air pollution matter, said that farmers have a genuine problem and their plight should be understood.""There is a huge problem of husk burning in Punjab. In Haryana also, farmers are burning husk. We have to plan a solution for this problem. /It is polluting Delhi and national capital region (NCR),"" Salve told the bench.He said the government should provide trains and trucks to remove these husks so that it is not burnt by the farmers. ""We understand the plight of farmers. Putting them in jail cannot be done. They have a genuine problem but at the same time, the city is choking due to this,"" Salve said.During the hearing, the court said it would first deal with a report of the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) relating to comprehensive action plan for air pollution control with the objective to meet ambient air quality in the Delhi-NCR, including states of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.The bench said as per the report, two issues, including the scheduled implementation of BS VI emission standards, were required to be dealt with by it.The court asked the government to come prepared for arguments on these issues and fixed the matter for hearing on November 17.The top court had earlier asked the Centre to mull over whether on-board diagnostic (OBD) scanners could be made compulsory for vehicle pollution test centres in grade A cities like Delhi, from December 1.OBD is an automotive term referring to a vehicle's self-diagnostic and reporting capability. OBD II is designed to inform a car owner about any malfunction, including problems with the brake or the emission control system.In its report filed in the court, EPCA has favoured a review and upgradation of the pollution under control norms for pre-BS IV vehicles and upgrade the test procedure for smoke density of commercial vehicles.The apex court is dealing with a petition which has raised the issue of air pollution and its ill-effects in and around Delhi and NCR.The court had on December 2 last year accorded its nod to the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to tackle different levels of pollution.It had also asked the Central Pollution Control Board to upgrade its existing infrastructure and set up additional monitoring stations in Delhi-NCR within six months. The GRAP, aimed at reducing air pollution, has enumerated a number of measures which include closing brick kilns, hot mix plants, stone crushers, intensifying public transport services besides increase in frequency of mechanised cleaning of road and sprinkling of water on roads.

"Gurugrammers raise bad air worries, say denied basic right","GURUGRAM: The Great Smog of London saw levels of air pollution so severe that up to 12,000 Londoners died as an immediate consequence of it, and more than a lakh were bedeviled by serious respiratory ailments. The quality of London's air had for long been notoriously poor but 1952's 'Big Smoke' (as those five nightmarish December days are collectively referred to) was a wake-up call which led to the Clean Air Act (1956).How many Gurugrammers must suffer and die before something is done to improve the quality of air in their city?The number of respiratory disorders reported by the young and old of Gurgaon has seen a worrying increase over the years. On Sunday, on an unusually warm October morning, residents from around the city gathered with placards ('Gurugram or gas chamber?'/, 'Let us breathe!') to raise their concerns at the quality of air they breathe, in a place they call home. For, to be denied clean air is to be denied a basic human right.The #CitizensForCleanAir campaign calls for existing guidelines to be rigorously implemented, besides suggesting measures to reduce the levels of dust on the ground and in the air. ""It's not just about those who live close to construction sites, or next to where garbage is being burnt. Because dust from construction activity or smoke from fires affects the air all of us in the city breathe,"" Ruchika Sethi, one of the concerned citizens involved in the campaign, told TOI.Mothers and fathers, the elderly and the young, walked about 500 metres to DPS International, on Golf Course Extension Road. Behind the school lies an open patch of land on which rubble and debris is deposited. ""We came here to bring attention to the many unsecured areas like this, in Gurgaon, where tractor-trolleys come and dump construction waste, which contributes to the pollution,"" said Sethi.Besides, there's a worrying lack of infrastructure to process the waste - commercial and residential, construction and debris, industrial, institutional and medical - that Gurgaon generates every day, a monumental dereliction of duty on the part of the administration. But it's not that the rules and regulations are absent; it's a lack of political backbone to enforce them.So, Gurugrammers end up inhaling a noxious cocktail. Dust from construction activity, dust lying on the sides of roads which oftentimes picks up in eddies, blown by the breeze or passing traffic; smoke from waste (of every sort) being burnt, not to mention fumes from trucks, buses and autos, and effluvia from factories. No wonder, then, that the city's air quality index frequently hovers in the 'very poor' or 'severe' range.Dr Ganesh Jevalikar, a pediatric endocrinologist, warns about the consequences of the alarmingly high levels of pollution. ""Such levels play havoc with lung development of young children and can cause permanent damage. It's a well-documented fact that air pollution is a potential killer and is associated with high incidences of bronchitis, asthma and pneumonia; high PM2.5 and particulate matter (is associated) with cancer; and dust (is associated) with fatal diseases like silicosis,"" he explained.""Several studies also show risks to unborn children, including damage to nervous system and higher risk of autism and ADHD.""It's a situation grim enough to demand urgent interventions. Because bad air affects people in high-rises as much as it does those living in slums. ""We can buy homes but not fresh air."" In Sethi's sober assessment is more than a kernel of truth, which Gurgaon can no longer afford to ignore./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Bad air may have snuffed out over 5 lakh lives in 2015: Study,"NEW DELHI: The Lancet Countdown 2017, a global research study of various climate change indicators, has flagged the health impact of PM2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) in India, suggesting that air pollution contributed to more than 5.2 lakh premature death in the country in 2015. The report released in London on Monday indicated that the biggest factors in premature mortality in this regard were household emissions, such as cooking with solid fuels, and high-stack pollution sources like industries and coal-fired power plants.The report also cautioned that the average length of a heat wave in India increased by 0.8 day on average between 2000 and 2016. ""Over this period, the average number of people over 65 years age exposed to heat waves was more than 150 million higher and the length of heat waves was 3.9 days longer than the 1986-2008 average,"" pointed out the India-specific data shared by Lancet with Global Strategic Communications Council , a network of communications professionals.The report, based on research by 24 academic institutions based in every continent, approximated 1.2 lakh of the 5.2 lakh pollution-linked deaths as due to household air pollution, more than 95,000 to emissions from high-stack sources and over 80,000 from coal emissions. The toll from ""natural"" sources of air pollution is estimated at more than 97,000. The authors of the report assessed India as the country with the second highest premature deaths from air pollution after China among south and southeast Asian countries.The sources of air pollution and greenhouse gases (GHG) overlap in many cases, says the report. /Researchers used atmospheric chemistry simulations to arrive at the contribution from each source. The premature deaths were calculated following the methodology used by World Health Organisation (WHO) and in the Global Burden of Disease 2013.Globally, 87% of cities are faltering in meeting WHO air pollution guidelines, warned the report. The rising heat has led to an increase of 3% and 5.9%, respectively in the scope for likely transmission of the dengue virus by two types of mosquitoes since 1990. In India, 3,792 people died of dengue in 2015. ""Climate change is happening and it's a health issue today for millions worldwide. However, we still have an opportunity to turn a looming medical emergency into the most significant advance for public health this century. We need urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The cost of inaction will be counted in preventable loss of life, on a large scale,"" said Professor Anthony Costello, co-chair of Lancet Countdown and director, WHO.Responding to the study, Anumita Roy Chowdhury, air pollution expert and executive director, Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""It is shameful that even after decades of air quality management and reduction in overall use of solid fuels, the census count shows an increase in the number of households using solid fuels. According to the 2001 census, the number of households using firewood was 100.84 million. This increased to 120.87 million in the 2011 census. India is caught in a chulha trap, killing an unacceptable number of women and children.""Lancet Countdown collaborates with climate scientists, ecologists, economists, engineers, public health professionals, and doctors among others, and reports on five annual indicators: climate change impact, exposure and vulnerability; adaptation planning; mitigation actions; economics and finance; and public and political engagement on the subject./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Exposed to sun and pollutants, traffic cops suffer from dry eyes","<a href=""mailto:Sunitha.Rao@timesgroup.comBengaluru"">Sunitha.Rao@timesgroup.comBengaluru</a>/: Incidence of dry eyes among traffic cops in Bengaluru is alarmingly high, a two-year study by ophthalmologists from Apollo Hospital has revealed. About 40% of the 623 traffic policemen covered under the study were found to be suffering from the problem, as against a prevalence rate of 10-15% among the general population.Benglauru's traffic police strength is 3,914 and most covered under the study were in the age group of 25-45. The report was recently submitted by Dr Shalini Shetty, senior consultant ophthalmologist from Apollo Hospital, to the city police commissioner. According to the report, 419 of the 623 traffic cops studied had eye problems. While 40% suffered from dry eyes, 28% had pterygium, a fleshy growth inside the eye that can block vision. /In all, 245 traffic cops suffered from ocular surface disease which included dry eye, chemical and thermal burns. While 186 of them suffered from refractive errors requiring glasses, 12 had cataract. ""Efficiency at work requires a good work environment. But traffic cops face heart, dust, vehicular emission, harsh sun and rain during their 8-10 hours of work. They are exposed to dust, pollution, harmful UV radiation and chemicals from vehicle emission. Prolonged exposure to these have adverse effects on their overall health and eyes too,"" said Dr Shalini.""Constant exposure to sunlight and pollution results in evaporation of the eyes' tear film, which provides antibiotics and battles allergies. When it evaporates, allergies and dry eyes increase,"" explained Dr Arun Samprathi, a city-based ophthalmologist. The study, incidentally, was the result of Dr Shalini noticing traffic cops, who came to her for their annual health checkup, frequently rubbing their eyes. ""To think of a traffic policeman's plight, one should only imagine standing in the middle of Silk Board junction for 2-3 hours,"" she said.In January, 50 of the 623 cops were given eye drops and glasses. ""We chose to follow up with only those who work near Bannerghatta Road, where our hospital is located . We saw 96% improvement in the symptoms,"" said Dr Shalini.They drink little water due to lack of toiletsWhile doctors suggested cops drink more water, their response only served as an eyeopener to the poor conditions under which they work.""We don't drink water because there are no public toilets near traffic signals. If we answer nature's call like others on roadsides, public will mock at us. They might even take our photographs and upload them online,"" said traffic cops.""Not drinking enough water and constant exposure to sun leave cops dehydrated. In our report, we have underlined the need for public toilets. They must also be provided with enclosed traffic islands for protection from sunlight,"" said Dr Shalini.Dr Bhujang Shetty, chairman, managing director, Narayana Nethralaya, said those standing in sun for long must drink a minimum 3-4 litres of water a day. ""It's unfortunate that traffic police don't drink water due to lack of toilets. They must wear UV-protected glasses,"" he said.Said police commissioner Suneel Kumar, ""Traffic cops can go for eye tests and get spectacles and required treatment if need be. If the cost of treatment is within prescribed limits, it'll be covered under Arogya Bhagya scheme.""Asked about cops being hesitant to drinking water, the commissioner said: ""As of now, we can't provide additional toilets and they have to use the ones closest to the signals. But if a traffic cop leaves the spot for five minutes to answer nature's call, even educated motorists will jump signals and create gridlocks. We have to find a solution to this problem.""

15 very poor days this October - 10 more than last year,"New Delhi: With the graded action plan in place and a cracker ban having been enforced this Diwali, you would have expected Delhi to have much cleaner air than last year. Surprisingly, that's not the case: on average, this October has been far more polluted than the last. However, the capital has seen much better air quality in the last one week compared to the same period last year when pollution levels fell into the ""severe"" category even before Diwali arrived. /Delhi averaged an AQI of 281 this October, according to CPCB data. Contrast this with an AQI of 275 last October, when the highest pollution level was recorded a day after Diwali with an AQI of 403. The capital saw as many as 15 ""very poor"" days in October this year against just five in October 2016. However, there were more ""severe"" days in October last year than in 2017, with the highest AQI recorded on October 31, 2016, when it touched 445.While the capital has seen much better air quality in the previous one week, experts say meteorological conditions are to blame for another phase of bad-air days as the ""calm"" winds aren't allowing particulate matter to disperse.""This is the transition phase of the season. There is very little or no movement of air due to shifting of wind directions. The air quality post-Diwali has improved this year. However, if meteorological conditions were more favourable, Delhi would have had much cleaner air during this period,"" said Dipankar Saha, head of CPCB's air laboratory.Saha said the capital saw an unprecedented episode of air pollution last year due to low pressure and calm weather, which led to the intrusion of dust and its accumulation in NCR. ""There has been a reduction in the amount of firecrackers burst and that has been reflected in the air quality. It would have been even better if the wind speed had improved during these few weeks. High moisture in the air is also preventing air quality to improve further,"" said Saha.Air quality has remained in the ""very poor"" category ever since Diwali this year and experts said it was unlikely to improve unless wind speeds picked up, aided by a rise in temperature. Delhi's AQI was recorded at 311 on Thursday - a stark improvement from the previous two days as wind speeds increased in the region.Officials from the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre said visibility would start falling from Saturday once again with Delhi seeing two ""clear"" days till Friday. ""Thursday saw minimum visibility over 1000 metres and Friday will be similar. There will be very little haze in the morning. However, conditions will deteriorate once again from Saturday where minimum visibility will be between 500 and 1000 metres with shallow fog occurring,"" Kuldeep Shrivastav, scientist at RWFC, said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Fireworks manufacturers urge Centre to lift ban in capital Delhi,"Madurai: Fireworks manufacturers in Sivakasi have urged the Union government to lift the ban on bursting of fireworks in Delhi for Diwali considering the lakhs of workers who would lose jobs in the sector as well as allied industries like transportation and retailing. While seeking the help of officials and politicians in the matter, they said they were also approaching IIT Chennai to seek help to reduce certain chemicals in their products and thereby pollution levels. ""Though our products do cause air pollution to some extent, we only work based on licences provided by the department of explosives, '' said K Mariappan secretary, Tamil Nadu Fireworks Amorces Manufacturers Association. /""The Centre's help is a must for the industry to develop and overcome hurdles we are now facing,"" said P Ganeshan, additional secretary of the organisation. Recently, All India Federation of Fireworks Association members met BJP national secretary H Raja in Sivakasi, where they urged him to help them get the Centre to lift the ban on fireworks in Delhi. Raja told them that the air pollution had been high in Delhi and other northern states during Diwali season and fireworks had been banned in a move to prevent it. He pointed out that many factors contributed to the high air pollution in those states. Without taking action to address these issues, banning fireworks in one stroke was not acceptable. Delhi had thousands of restaurants where tandoori cookers emit smoke and pollutants. Vehicular and industrial pollution was also high. `` His words were encouraging and we hope he will help us,'' they said.The manufacturers said that they too were determined to make their products environmental-friendly. Now, they had decided to approach IIT Chennai to seek its help to reduce the levels of air polluting chemicals in their products.""We hope they will help us in this endeavour and we are keeping our fingers crossed,'' they said adding that the fireworks industry provided livelihood to three lakh people directly, five lakh indirectly and eight lakh in related jobs throughout the country./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Delhi turns into Hitler's 'gas chamber'! Here's what smog does to your body,"What was used as a means of torture for Jews by the Nazi government has turned into the reality of every Delhiite! 'This way for the gas, ladies and gentlemen' (a story collection on Nazi government by Tadeusz Borowski), should read Delhi's signboards as the city's air pollution is being compared with gas chambers. The air quality index of the city shot up to 451 on a scale where the maximum level is 500. Inhaling this air has been equated with smoking 50 cigarettes a day by doctors. So, who is worse, chain smokers or Delhiites?/ The latter, it seems. So, in how many ways fog harms your body? What are its causes and effects? Here we take a look at the undercurrents of the subject.What is smog?It refers to a combination of smoke and fog, thus forming the word smog. It is a complex mixture that is formed by various pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides and dust particles, which interact with the sunlight to form ground-level ozone, leading to the build-up of haze that hangs in industrial cities.Causes of smogSmog is caused as a result of industrial activities, vehicular traffic, open burning, incinerators, higher temperature, geography of a place, sunlight and calmer winds. These all factors contribute to an all-encompassing smog as the length for which smog remains in the atmosphere can be lengthened by higher temperature and sunlight.However, it must be noted that smog is caused in a location that is far from the source of pollution. This is because the process that leads to smog occurs after the hazardous particles have been drifted away by the wind.Effects of smogExposure to smog can be severely harmful for the health of the exposed as it can cause/aggravate health conditions such as follows:Chest infections/Irritation: When you inhale ground-level ozone, it can affect your respiratory system in an adverse way, leading to coughing and irritation. When you are exposed to it for longer durations, it can even lead to lung infections.Worsening of asthma/bronchitis/emphysema: Patients of such respiratory problems have the worst of times when smog hits such high levels. Patients can have frequent and severe asthma attacks. In extreme cases, the risk of developing these diseases may also significantly shoot up.Cold and eye irritation: Smog significantly reduces one's immunity to cold and can cause irritation in the eyes.Premature mortality: A study by RICE university showed that ground-level ozone and PM 2.5 are direct contributors to an increased risk of premature mortality.Damage to crops: Besides impacting humans negatively, smog can also inhibit plant growth and cause damage to forests and crops.Who is at a greater risk?Smog affects everyone differently, depending on their lifestyle, health condition and age. The groups which are the most susceptible are:Children: As children spend a lot of time outdoors, they are more prone to getting affected by smog the most. Also, their risk of developing asthma is quite high as it is the most common respiratory ailment among children.People with respiratory disorders: If someone already has respiratory problems like asthma, severe bronchitis or emphysema will experience a worsening of symptoms when they are exposed to smog as they are more vulnerable to the effects of ground-level ozone.Adults who have high level of outdoor activity: If you exercise, cycle or jog outdoors or if you have a job that requires you to stay outdoors, you are more susceptible to the harms of ozone.What you can doThe best approach to prevent damage from smog is to limit your outdoor activity. If ozone levels are high, you must stay indoors as much as possible. However, make sure that your homes and offices have a strong exhaust system. This is because the air pollution inside can many-a-times be more harmful than air outside. This happens due to household activities which produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as activities in the kitchen.There are many Ayurveda hacks also that can help limit the damage caused by ground-level ozone and air pollution. You can read them here .If you think that by drinking filtered water you can help prevent or limit the damage of air pollution, you are absolutely wrong. Thing to ponder - you merely drink two to four litres of filtered water in a day. Against this, you inhale around 16,000 litres of toxic air every day. Imagine the kind of harm it does to you and your body!/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Better air only by Friday noon: IMD,"NEW DELHI: Expect the killer smog to stay over Delhi-NCR for another day-and-a-half. Met officials said the weather condition that is trapping pollutants close to the land is expected to lift by Friday afternoon, when stronger northwesterly winds start blowing.The winds will help disperse the smog, at least to an extent, a top India Meteorological Department official said on Wednesday. He also confirmed that the thick smoky haze enveloping the region since Monday morning was indeed smog.""There is an anti-cyclonic wind circulation over the north India centred just southwest of Delhi. /Under its effect, the surface wind layer is calm and is being pushed downwards, leading to an accumulation of pollutants close to the surface,"" said M Mohapatra, head of services at IMD.An anti-cyclone is a wind circulation that moves in the clockwise direction, pushing air downward, much like the turning of a screw that's being drilled in. This leads to a high-pressure zone near the land surface, making the atmosphere thicker and preventing air from outside getting into the region.The circulation is expected to be broken by a western disturbance, when it passes through the region, bringing northwesterly winds in its wake. ""Our weather models indicate that these winds will be of higher speed and are expected to start sweeping through NCR around Friday afternoon,"" Mohapatra said.He also said it is smog - an atmospheric mixture of pollutants (smoke) and haze (fog at night) - that has covered the capital and rest of NCR for the past two days, leading to a sharp dip in air quality to 'severe' levels. ""For the formation of fog, which is basically a low cloud, relative humidity has to be above 75%. What we are seeing in the capital is smog since it is persisting through the day when humidity drops way below 75%,"" the official said.The formation of the anti-cyclone has led to meteorological conditions similar to what was observed during the first week of November last year, when air quality in the capital plunged to a record low. An anti-cyclone had then trapped Diwali pollution over the capital while pollutants from stubble-burning in Punjab and Haryana got transported into NCR through upper winds.Similarly, Mohapatra said current meteorological conditions are such that smoke from crop burning could be entering the air through upper layer winds subsiding over NCR - a strong possibility pointed to by air pollution experts.""The eye of the anti-cyclone has a 500km diameter, encompassing much of Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and parts of Madhya Pradesh,"" he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Delhi, you're killing me","NEW DELHI: Bringing back terrifying memories of last November's apocalyptic smog, Delhi awoke to find itself shrouded in a toxic grey haze on Tuesday . Air quality fell to ""severe"" levels, worse than post Diwali pollution in the city .Roads wore a dystopian look with pollution masks everywhere as Delhiites complained of headaches, burning eyes, breathing discomfort, runny noses and a depressive mood. The Indian Medical Association described it as a ""public health emergency"".The city's air quality index (AQI) touched 448, as per CPCB, worse than the 403 reading Delhi had recorded a day after Diwali. On November 5 last year, the AQI was 485, with extremely poor visibility that meteorologists had described as a ""smoke haze"". Delhiites had hoped they would never have to see such extreme smog again. But on Tuesday , at least 15 air quality stations were again in ""severe"" category .Experts said the next few days are likely to be just as bad, as calm wind conditions and high humidity were leading to an accumulation of pollutants. /Explaining the sudden drop in air quality, they said it was a deadly mix of crop-burning pollutants coming in from Punjab and Haryana and moisture entering the region from UP.A source in pollution research body SAFAR said high speed upper winds from north-northwest had most likely brought in stubble-burning pollutants from midnight onwards. Calm surface winds allowed the pollutants to settle over NCR. CPCB said moisture laden easterly winds were also coming to the capital, trapping particulate matter locally and causing fog as well.Among NCR locations, Ghaziabad was the worst with an AQI of 475, followed by Noida at 468. Ghaziabad has suspended primary classes for two days and ordered a stop to all private construction activity.Under ""severe"" conditions, exposure to polluted air outdoors can ""affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases"". Several studies have concluded that hospital admissions go up drastically during such severe air pollution episodes. The short-term impacts are related to respiratory and heart ailments. What we know for sure from studies and otherwise is that during winter there is a strong correlation between pollution levels and hospital admissions,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury , head of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE's) clean air programme.Officials at the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said weather conditions were likely to remain the same for the next 48 hours. There will be little or no wind to help disperse the pollutants.""Relative humidity has gone up to 80% and may rise even further to around 90% which is causing fog. This fog is preventing ground level concentration from dispersing and the same weather conditions are likely to stay the same for the next 48 hours at least. It is a double whammy with westerly winds bringing pollutants and easterly winds bringing moisture as wind speeds are below 2ms which is not allowing particulate matter to disperse,"" said A Sudhakar, CPCB member secretary .The Indian Medical Association (IMA) issued a warning on Tuesday , describing Delhi as a ""public health emergency"" state and asking authorities to shut down schools. TOI had reported on Monday that industrial areas such as Jahangirpuri, Wazirpur and Okhla Phase-II were consistently recording dangerously high particulate matter concentrations, which indicates that the particles may be toxic considering they are being emitted from industrial zones.Despite experiencing the worst smog in 17 years last November, Delhi's public transport infrastructure didn't improve much. Delhi still has only about half the number of buses it needs to meet its demand. It didn't do much to improve pedestrian and non-motorised transport infrastructure in the past year which could have discouraged use of polluting private vehicles. Though Delhi government blamed neighbouring states for most of the emissions, experts said Delhi has a lot to do still. A massive augmentation of public transport within and intercity is needed.""Not a single bus has been procured in Delhi over the last three years. This will only add to the pollution crisis.Cities need massive action to change garbage management system to stop the burning of garbage. In addition, strict enforcement is needed,"" a statement from EPCA said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Patients queue up at hospitals,"NEW DELHI: Prahlad, a 38-year-old marketing executive in a private company, has been gasping for breath since past few weeks. On Wednesday, as the pollution level picked up further in the capital, Prahlad's condition worsened. He began to cough frequently and complained of headache. /And he is not alone - more and more apparently healthy people working outdoors are turning up at health facilities with similar conditions. Physicians and pulmonologists say every second patient is complaining about chest tightness, breathlessness and burning sensation in the eyes - all caused by pollution. Nilanjana Gupta, who works in Dubai, said she had been put on inhalers and other medications. ""When I was abroad, I didn't have any breathing difficulty. Delhi's air is so toxic, it is almost difficult to breathe,"" Gupta said.A few minutes in the polluted air can cause allergy, eye irritation, sore throat, cough and difficulty in breathing along with headache, sleepiness, lowered alertness, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Over a period, it may trigger respiratory problems like asthma, bronchitis, damage to lung tissues, poor lung function and even lung cancer. It may also lead to heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, palpitation, diabetes, anxiety, depression, stress and shortened lifespan, say experts.AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria compared the situation in Delhi with Great Smog of 1952 in London - a severe air pollution situation that led to the deaths of over 4,000 people. Pollution is at such a severe level that patients with respiratory and cardiac problems may develop life-threatening conditions, he said. ""This is a silent killer."" Safdarjung Hospital has also witnessed an increase in such patients at OPDs and casualties over the past two days, said the professor and head of pulmonary medicine, Dr J C Suri. ""Elderly people and children are more likely to develop infections and allergies due to smog and pollution. They should avoid going out during the early morning and at dusk hours when the toxic level is at its peak,"" he said.Dr Rommel Tickkoo, senior consultant (internal medicine) at Max Hospital, Saket, and Dr Arunesh Kumar, senior consultant (pulmonology), Paras Hospitals, said there was more than 20% increase in the number of patients with pollution-related health issues. ""People should avoid outdoor activities and, if urgent, they should wear masks to avoid contaminated air,"" Dr Kumar said.While Indian Medical Association termed the current crisis a public health emergency, the Union health ministry issued a public advisory suggesting people to remain indoors, if possible. The Delhi government also released a health advisory urging Delhiites to use carpooling and public transport, stay indoors and not to smoke./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Smog affects visibility, air quality in Lucknow 'very poor'","LUCKNOW: Even as reports of haze and low visibility in northern region hogged headlines, the situation in the state capital has not been any better either. Lucknow has also been witnessing smog for the last two days with pollution levels being many times of permissible standards.The rapid fall in air quality and visibility began on Monday evening as moisture combined with pollutants shrouded the city .The Air Quality Index (AQI) in the city was in the higher ranges of very poor and severe air quality categories.Experts in UP Pollution Control Board said that more than local reasons, the burning of agriculture waste in Punjab and Haryana is contributing to haze formation and high air pollution levels.""Burning of agriculture waste is rampant in Punjab and Haryana between October-end and November start. Winds are carrying the pollutants to Delhi and UP,"" said sources.According to the live air quality monitoring station of the Central Pollution Control Board, the PM2.5 levels in Lalbagh area almost doubled on Tuesday .""Our environment monitoring division noted that PM2.5 levels in Lalbagh increased from 150 micrograms to almost 300 micrograms in a day , many times over permissible limit of 60,"" said IITR director Alok Dhawan.As per CPCB data, the air pollution levels at Lalbagh with PM2.5 concentration was 261.06 micrograms per cubic metre of air on Monday which increased to 326.24 micrograms.Not Only Lalbagh, at Talkatora the levels increased from 369 to 333 and at Central school, Aliganj pollutants increased from 142.64 to 222.84 micrograms. /The toxic substances kept on ri sing throughout the day Tuesday The average values for Tuesday at 4pm showed the air quality to be `severe' in Noida, Ghaziabad and Moradabad while it was `very poor' for Agra, Lucknow and Kanpur.Since wind velocity has reduced by 3 to 4 km per hour in recent days, pollutants have accumulated and stagnated.

Thick smog envelopes region,"Amritsar: Amid a thick blanket of morning smog, residents of Amritsar and its adjoining areas were on Tuesday seen waking up to poor visibility and rushing to buy face masks in a bid to get protection from air pollution.Deputy director, public relations, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) Dr. Charanjit Singh informed TOI on Tuesday that these days there weren't many cases of stubble burning in Majha but in Malwa. ""The particulate matter is getting diverted towards Amritsar due to wind directions, causing a thick layer of smog,"" he said.Smog had engulfed the city since Monday evening, making visibility to fall less than fifty metres. Singh also attributed the smog to a sudden fall in temperature. ""A sudden fall in the temperature in absence of high velocity winds had led to inversion of particulate matters. /Winds velocity is almost zero, which is causing inversion of particulate matter resulting in smog,"" he said. ""The conditions were likely to persist until it rains or there were high velocity winds,"" he said.Dr HS Nagpal advised to not go for morning walk in smog as it could cause various health hazards. ""During smog, patients come to us complaining of breathlessness, cough etc,"" he said and added that people could use air purifiers in their homes and avoid going out in the smog.A pharmacy owner Rajiv Mehra informed that since last late evening he has witnessed anxious buying of face masks by two-wheeler owners. ""Inhaling smog is not only unhealthy but dangerous too. Wearing a face mask reduces exposure to the pollutants,"" he said.Charanjit said that emissions of diesel fueled vehicles were only adding to the problem since diesel smoke is heavier than the petrol.The deputy director also informed that this was a common phenomenon in the month of November. He attributed this to various reasons like stubble burning, vehicles, firecracker pollution, fall in temperature, etc./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Follow EPCA's rules for Delhi: CSE,"On a day when a thick polluted haze enveloped Delhi-NCR, the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) has directed governments to impose all conditions under the severe category of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). This plan is an emergency plan, which cannot become a substitute for long term and decisive action to cut air pollution, said EPCA chairperson, Bhure Lal.Under this plan, the task force led by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has been monitoring air quality in NCR and also has forecasts for the coming days. A Sudhakar, Member Secretary, CPCB, explained the prevailing weather conditions as follows: ""Currently, Delhi and its neighbouring region are seeing almost still conditions at the ground level, but in the upper atmosphere there are two wind masses - one from Punjab, which is bringing pollutants from crop burning and the other from eastern UP, which is bringing moisture. These are colliding at the higher altitude. This is leading to conditions where there is both moisture and pollution as well as no wind at the ground level."" /He said that he expects conditions to remain severe over the next two days as per the forecast made available by IMD.Given this advisory and the prevailing severe conditions, the EPCA has issued the following directions as listed under GRAP for measures to be put in place immediately. These directions are for governments of NCR, including Delhi. *Closure of all brick kiln, other than those that have been certified to have converted to zig zag.

All brick kilns in NCR will be shut.*Closure of all hot mix plants and stone crushers*Immediately intensify public transport service, by ensuring there are more buses on road, which are run with reliable service.*Immediately increase frequency of service of Delhi Metro, including deploying more coaches and introduction of lower fares during off peak hours during this severe period.*All state pollution control boards to immediately impose fines on all road constructing agencies where there are inadequate dust control measures. Taking into account the provision of C&D rules, which allow for penalty of up to Rs 5 lakh for construction dust mismanagement, EPCA is directing for a fine of Rs 50,000 to be imposed as penalty per day per stretch for inadequate road dust control.*Intensification of mechanized road sweeping and sprinkling of water*Continuation of the ban on use of generator sets in Delhi, with exceptions only as defined by DPCC for essential services*Immediate enhancement of parking fee by 4 times and depositing additional funds in dedicated parking fund with municipalities*Immediately stop use of coal and firewood in hotels and eateries. Implement the Hon'ble Supreme Court order on pet coke and furnace oil*Intensify traffic management in all hotspots and increase deployment of traffic police to avoid congestion.*Intensify the enforcement of non-destined goods traffic into Delhi by physically checking all vehicles and turning them back - also, putting out public announcements of the numbers that are turned back. The EPCA is also monitoring the situation carefully in coordination with the CPCB task force. Given the prevailing conditions and the concern about the possible deterioration in weather conditions, it is possible that severe plus or emergency conditions would need to be imposed in the coming days. EPCA is, therefore, directing governments to ensure that all agencies are ready to implement tougher measures as laid down in GRAP. In addition, the EPCA is also advising schools to stop all outdoor activities and to keep exposure to a minimum. This is also advice to all citizens of Delhi and NCR. Under severe conditions as prevailing today, the health advisory of MOEF&CC says that it may cause respiratory effects even on healthy people. Therefore, exposure and outdoor activities, including intense physical activities should be minimised. It is clear that combatting air pollution requires drastic action, which is long term. Mr Lal said: ""We have achieved some things - often in the face of enormous odds -- and we have provided some solutions. So far, every solution that has been suggested has been contested and delayed. Today, weather conditions in Delhi-NCR are adverse, and the wind is bringing pollution from farm fires in Punjab and moisture from the east. In terms of air pollution, things are expected to get much worse in the coming days. We, therefore, need to act decisively."" The EPCA has called for the following long-term actions, which are in the hands of government. Unless these steps are taken starting today, air pollution levels cannot be brought down:Drastic action is needed to immediately ban pet coke and furnace oil in the entire NCR. We need stringent monitoring of emissions in industrial estates and as well as from illegal industries.A massive switch-over to gas is needed in vehicles, power plants and industry. The region needs a second transition to natural gas and clean fuels. We must prioritise transition to electric vehicles, and ensure supply of reliable power to stop the use of gen-sets.A massive augmentation of public transport within and inter-city is needed. Not a single bus has been procured in Delhi over the last three years. This will only add to the pollution crisis.Cities need massive action to change garbage management system to stop the burning of garbage. In addition, strict enforcement is needed. EPCA member and director general of Centre for Science and Environment Sunita Narain pointed out that unless this agenda is put in place, air quality cannot improve./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Submit average pollution data: CPCB to Haryana board,"GURUGRAM: As haze continued to shroud the city for the second day in a row and air quality entered 'severe' zone, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Wednesday instructed the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) to submit average data of all air quality monitoring machines installed in the NCR cities of the state.""We had a meeting with officials of HSPCB and pollution boards of other states in other NCR cities on Wednesday. It was decided that an average data of all air quality monitoring machines of NCR districts in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan will be given in order to take a call on the implementation of the graded response action plan (GRAP) in those cities. It will help us get a better picture of the situation in NCR cities,"" said an official of CPCB on condition of anonymity.Particulate matter (PM) 2.5 reached the 'severe' level in Gurgaon on Wednesday morning and increased further in the evening. /The highest level of PM2.5 was recorded at 369.93 micrograms per cubic metre, six times higher than the permissible limit. On Tuesday, the highest level of PM2.5 was 215.54 micrograms per cubic metre. Air quality index (AQI) also plunged from 368 ('very poor' category) on Tuesday to 459 ('severe' category) on Wednesday.Jai Bhagwan, regional officer of HSPCB, told TOI, ""An average data of 48 hours will be provided to CPCB from all NCR cities of Haryana. The course of action will then be decided to take GRAP measures. As far as Gurgaon is concerned, the situation is better than other NCR cities. Also, emergency measures will be implemented only if PM2.5 levels remain in 'severe' category for 48 hours. However, we have continuously been taking adequate measures to combat air pollution in the city.""So far, the authorities have not taken enough measures listed under GRAP to bring the situation under control. ""Just issuing orders without deliberations with executing agencies will not be effective. We will therefore issue directions probably on Thursday,"" said Gurgaon's deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh. According to Met officials, the situation is likely to improve after two to three days. ""The problem is that burning of crop stubble continues to take place in Punjab and Haryana. This coupled with low wind speed and increase in moisture has led to the haze. However, the condition is expected to get better only after two to three days, as we are expecting a slight increase in the wind speed and better sunlight,"" an official said.If emergency measures given in GRAP are implemented, the authorities might have to temporarily close the schools, implement the odd-even car rationing scheme and shut down all polluting industries in the city./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Delhi, you're killing me","Bringing back terrifying memories of last November's apocalyptic smog, Delhi awoke to find itself shrouded in a toxic grey haze on Tuesday . Air quality fell to ""severe"" levels, worse than post Diwali pollution in the city .Roads wore a dystopian look with pollution masks everywhere as Delhiites complained of headaches, burning eyes, breathing discomfort, runny noses and a depressive mood. The Indian Medical Association described it as a ""public health emergency"".The city's air quality index (AQI) touched 448, as per CPCB, worse than the 403 reading Delhi had recorded a day after Diwali. On November 5 last year, the AQI was 485, with extremely poor visibility that meteorologists had described as a ""smoke haze"". Delhiites had hoped they would never have to see such extreme smog again. But on Tuesday, at least 15 air quality stations were again in ""severe"" category .Experts said the next few days are likely to be just as bad, as calm wind conditions and high humidity were leading to an accumulation of pollutants. /Explaining the sudden drop in air quality, they said it was a deadly mix of crop-burning pollutants coming in from Punjab and Haryana and moisture entering the region from UP.A source in pollution research body SAFAR said high speed upper winds from northnorthwest had most likely brought in stubble-burning pollutants from midnight onwards. Calm surface winds allowed the pollutants to settle over NCR. CPCB said moisture laden easterly winds were also coming to the capital, trapping particulate matter locally and causing fog as well.Among NCR locations, Ghaziabad was the worst with an AQI of 475, followed by Noida at 468. Ghaziabad has suspended primary classes for two days and ordered a stop to all private construction activity.Under ""severe"" conditions, exposure to polluted air outdoors can ""affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases"". Several studies have concluded that hospital admissions go up drastically during such severe air pollution episodes. The short-term impacts are related to respirato ry and heart ailments. What we know for sure from studies and otherwise is that during winter there is a strong correlation between pollution levels and hospital admissions,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE's) clean air programme.Officials at the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said weather conditions were likely to remain the same for the next 48 hours. There will be little or no wind to help disperse the pollutants.""Relative humidity has gone up to 80% and may rise even further to around 90% which is causing fog. This fog is preventing ground level concentration from dispersing and the same weather conditions are likely to stay the same for the next 48 hours at least. It is a double whammy with westerly winds bringing pollutants and easterly winds bringing moisture as wind speeds are below 2ms which is not allowing particulate matter to disperse,"" said A Sudhakar, CPCB member secretary .The Indian Medical Association (IMA) issued a warning on Tuesday, describing Delhi as a ""public health emergency"" state and asking authorities to shut down schools. TOI had reported on Monday that industrial areas such as Jahangirpuri, Wazirpur and Okhla Phase-II were consistently recording dangerously high particulate matter concentrations, which indicates that the particles may be toxic considering they are being emitted from industrial zones.Despite experiencing the worst smog in 17 years last November, Delhi's public transport infrastructure didn't improve much. Delhi still has only about half the number of buses it needs to meet its demand. It didn't do much to improve pedestrian and non-motorised transport infrastructure in the past year which could have discouraged use of polluting private vehicles. Though Delhi government blamed neighbouring states for most of the emissions, experts said Delhi has a lot to do still. A massive augmentation of public transport within and intercity is needed.""Not a single bus has been procured in Delhi over the last three years. This will only add to the pollution crisis.Cities need massive action to change garbage management system to stop the burning of garbage.

"From very poor, Lucknow air now severely harmful","LUCKNOW: Smog conditions intensified as air pollution in the state capital rose to more than seven times above safe limits, close to alarming levels in Delhi, on Wednesday. For the third time in November, Lucknow's air turned toxic, the analysis of air quality index (AQI) by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for November showed. Last year, Lucknow was the most polluted city in the country on November 8. On the same day this year too, thick smog engulfed the city , taking pollution level to severe.According to AQI data re leased by CPCB for 40 cities, Lucknow's air was under `severe' category with the concentration of PM2.5--the finest and most hazardous particulate matter--at 430 micrograms per cubic meter of air against the permissible limit of 60 micrograms per cubic meter of air.The `severe' category affects even healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases. /Pollution level was up 65 micrograms from Tuesday , when air quality was `very poor'.According to live readings of air quality from monitoring stations of CPCB in Lalbagh, Talkatora, and Aliganj, toxic substances in the atmosphere kept rising all day .PM2.5 was a prominent pollutant at all three locations.According to Indian Institute of Toxicology Research director Alok Dhawan, pollution levels were high throughout the day with maximum level recorded in the afternoon when AQI crossed 400.""Air has limited pollutioncarrying capacity . We live in air columns congested with excess of pollution with construction activities, garbage burning and vehicular pollution going on together in all parts of the city ,"" said Dhawan.With the city facing severe pollution levels, burning activities should be heavily penalized by the government, he said. The situation, he said, will worsen otherwise.According to the director of the environment monitoring station at Lucknow University Prof Dhruv Singh, smog engulfed the city due to low wind speed./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Use-and-throw gadget is President's favourite air filter,"NEW DELHI: While the city is reeling from the pollution in the air, markets are seeing a surge in people buying anti-pollution masks. Amongst all this, former IIT-Delhi students, as part of the institute's incubation centre, have developed an easy to use air filtration system called Nasofilter, which unlike ordinary pollution mask does not hinder speaking and is easy to use.Recently, at the IIT-Delhi convocation, President Kovind made a special mention of the product in his speech as an example of innovation by students. The NasoFilter -made of porous membrane - can be stuck to the nasal orifice and can clear PM 2.5 from the air being breathed.The filter is made up of biodegradable polymer using nanotechnology and can be easily peeled off. /It does not affect breathing or other activities.""The filter can be used continuously for 10 hours more. It is based on a use-and-throw principle, and since it is biodegradable, it doesn't harm the environment,"" said Prateek Sharma, co-creator of the product.Sharma explained that the product involves assembling millions of small pores to create a thin flexible membrane, which could capture very small particles with high efficiency. ""This allows filters to be used for long hours while maintaining good breathability and comfort. The filters aim to provide relief to common users from air pollution and to protect people, who are prone to allergies, and safeguard those who are exposed to job related industrial particulate pollutants as well.""He also said that the filter does not hide the face, cause fogging of glasses or make it difficult to speak properly.This product was awarded the Startups National Award 2017 by the Technology Development Board a few months ago to protect against air pollutants and minimise the risk of respiratory diseases./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Hazy skies to envelop city for 2 more days,"PATNA: Patna could not have a glimpse of the sun for the third consecutive day on Thursday, raising a pollution alarm for the Bihar capital which was ranked the world's sixth most polluted and the country's third most polluted city by the World Health Organisation last year.While environmental and meteorological scientists confirmed the hazy skies over the city is like the smog in Delhi, the Bihar State Disaster Management Authority (BSDMA) underlined the need for a coordinated monitoring of the situation.""In view of the air emergency declared in Delhi, we in Bihar should monitor the situation in coordination with the Bihar State Pollution Control Board and the health department. The DMs have been advised to review the situation at the district level. A meeting will be organised by the BSDMA with the agencies concerned to review the situation and develop an advisory for mitigation, if need be,"" BSDMA's vice-chairman Vyasji said on Thursday.The BSDMA also released a photograph taken by one of the satellites of National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which shows a patch of brown clouds over the Gangetic plains stretching from the NCR region in north to Bihar in the east.Most of the factors that have spawned the smog in Delhi are present in case of Patna too, especially the ultrafine particulate matter, scientifically termed PM10 and PM2.5. The situation aggravates, at least visibly, in the winter when the pollutants settle down close to the earth's surface, forming a layer of smog in the lower level of atmosphere. /Moist and calm winds aggravate the situation.With regard to the haze in the city on Thursday, weathermen said the visibility reduced to as low as 900metres. ""The comparatively lower temperature and winds blowing at nearly zero kilometre per hour these days are making the particulate matter heavier. As a result, they do not escape to the upper layer of atmosphere and settle down close to the earth's surface leading to the formation of smog,"" Patna Meteorological Centre director S Sengupta said, adding such conditions were likely to prevail in the Gangetic plains over the next two days.Air pollution, primarily higher level of Respiratory Suspended Particulate Matter, has been a cause of concern in Patna even on normal days. The level of particulate matter is normally recorded thrice the normal level of respective standard of 100 micrograms per cubic metre during the winter. Even on Thursday, the level of PM2.5 in Patna was measured at 383 micrograms per cubic metre.""November-December is considered crucial with regard to particulate matter in the region. The soot-like particles settle down under low temperature and stable wind conditions, making the air in the lower level of atmosphere heavier, dense and more polluted,"" said BSPCB scientist Naveen Kumar.WINTER SMOG, WHAT?""From November onwards, surface wind starts coming from the northwest over the Himalayan region. Simultaneously a high- pressure area develops at a certain height in the atmosphere over the Gangetic plains. This phenomenon creates stable atmospheric conditions - cold and dense air - in the lower level of atmosphere and relatively lighter air in the upper layer. If the wind is calm, as is the situation currently, pollutants going into the atmosphere through various sources do not disperse up to a long distance vertically as well as horizontally, and remain suspended in the lower atmosphere along with the moisture. This results in hazy environment.

Dr Arunesh Kumar, pulmonologist, Paras Hospital, said, ""There has been an increase of at least 20% in new asthma patients, every two years. For those who are raised in Gurgaon, chances of developing lung diseases by old age are, of course, high.""Anumita Roychowdhary of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said that both authorities and residents have to take responsibility to make a big difference. /""Gurgaon is landlocked and thus dust gets trapped and has no way to leave the city. The city also doesn't have enough air pollution monitors. I think that small actions can make a difference and that all issues do not get equal attention,"" she said, addressing the gathering. MCG officials, who were also present at the workshop, assured of immediate action and asked people to use mobile applications to report cases of environmental violations. Guidelines for locals have been prepared to combat air pollution. ""Citizens should use the Swachhata app to lodge complaints against waste burning and other malpractices by putting up photographs and mentioning the site location. We ensure that action will be taken within 48 hours,"" said Sudhir Chauhan, senior town planner, MCG.Many residents used the platform to ask questions to doctors and MCG officials to address their concerns over air pollution. The workshop included presentations and discussions on real-time air pollution data, discussion of problems and solutions by experts, discussion on impact on quality of life and diseases, and an interaction session with authorities. The objective of the programme was to evaluate steps that can be taken at an individual, community and city level to deal with the emergency situation./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Delhi smog: Docs are worried about your lung health, you should too","Air pollution has soared to worrisome levels in the capital recently. In fact a U.S. embassy monitor showed alarming recordings of PM 2.5 in Delhi on Wednesday. For the unversed, PM 2.5 is a deadly, tiny air pollutant, which doctors warn can lodge deep into our lungs. This has naturally got most of us worried about the amounts we have already ingested.With concentrations of PM 2.5 topping dangerous levels, health experts are concerned. /Delhi-based Dr Vikas Maurya, Senior Consultant & Head of Department, Respiratory Medicine & Interventional Pulmonology, Department of Pulmonology & Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh shares, ""While children and elderly are definitely at a greater risk, the smog can decrease lung function across age groups. Not only that, it may also aggravate pre-existing lung and cardiac functions among people along with uncontrollable or chronic coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.""Many studies have linked smog-affected areas to a greater risk of stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, heightened respiratory diseases and even dementia. So what about the pollutants we have already ingested? ""These particulates (PM 2.5) are particularly dangerous because they are so microscopic they can enter deep into the body, and travel through the bloodstream to any part of the body. So not only lungs but all parts of the body are prone to harmful effects. It can start some reaction and attack our immune system,"" adds Dr Maurya. Dr Prashant Chhajed, Pulmonologist, Fortis Hospital Vashi says, ""While nothing can remove what you have already inhaled, the symptoms have to be treated symptomatically."" He recommends patients with bronchitis and asthma to take advised medication and not wait for the symptoms to get worse. What can you doDr Salil Bendre, Head of Department, Pulmonary Medicine, Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital advises warm water gargles and steam inhalation. ""They will humidify nasal passage and remove dust particles from the nasal passage."" Bangalore-based Dr Vivek Anand Padegal, pulmonologist, chest and sleep medicine feels otherwise. ""There is no body of evidence to support that a certain diet or workout will help eliminate the ill-effects of pollution from our bodies. Naturally a healthy person will be able to take pollution impact better than an unhealthy person. This is where overall health comes into play. Also, smoking should be avoided at all costs."" Pollution combined with nicotine or tobacco can interfere with smooth lung function and put you at high risk.Elderly and diabetics must get vaccinated - pneumonia vaccination every five years and influenza vaccine every year.

? Stubble burning in Rohilkhand adding to NCR smog woes,"Bareilly: The commencement of sugarcane crushing and paddy harvesting season in the last week of October also signals the beginning of stubble burning as farmers resort to the practice in a bid to save labour cost and prepare their fields for wheat crop of Rabi season from the second week of November./Though stubble burning has been banned by the National Green Tribunal, no efforts have been made to stop it. The resultant smoke causes a thick haze that has surrounded the whole of NCR. Air quality in Rohilkhand region too has been affected, with air quality index (AQI) of PM 2.5 recorded at 500, against the acceptable limit of 100, in Moradabad on Tuesday./On asking how it affects NCR when stubble burning takes place in neighbouring region of Rohilkhand, Bhure Lal, chairman of the environment pollution (prevention & control) authority for NCR, told TOI, “Winds coming from both eastern and western parts of the country also carry the pollution load with them. It is happening at about 40 to 45 km above ground level. Once air and pollutants mix, a shallow fog-type situation is created and particulate matter remains suspended as it does not get dispersed because wind speed is almost zero at ground level.”/Environmentalists said the problem cannot be overcome till the government takes initiatives to prevent air pollution. DK Saxena, coordinator of air monitoring programme of state pollution control board in Bareilly said stubble burning in Bareilly region, which is around 200 km from the NCR, can affect AQI in Delhi also. “It depends on the wind's direction and its speed. If the wind blows towards NCR, stubble burning in Rohilkhand region will definitely increase pollution level in NCR like stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana has been causing a smog in Delhi in the previous years,” he said./Raman Tyagi, a Meerut-based environment activist and director of an NGO, NEER Foundation, said, “On burning 1 kg of biomass, 1.5 kg carbon dioxide is produced. Cane residue is burnt across entire west UP on such a largescale that the smog has engulfed the entire NCR at the onset of winter.”/Ram Asare Yadav who owns around 10 acre of agriculture land in Kanjanpur village of Faridpur tehsil told TOI that 90% of cane growers burn the residue at their field as it is the fastest and easiest way to get rid of cane residue. “Moreover, after harvesting sugarcane, we have a small window of 20-25 days to sow the next crop of wheat. Burnt biomass is decomposes faster than the residue,” he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

In fact, Lucknow was the sixth most polluted city in the country of the 42 monitored by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).In both cities, there was high concentration of prominent pollutants PM2.5 and PM10. The concentration of PM2.5 was seven times more than the permissible limit, causing health problems. In both Delhi and Lucknow, haze took over the city since early morning. A sheet of dense smog enveloped the city, placing it in the `severe' category again after Wednesday . According to doctors, the toxicity in the air has led to a spike in respiratory problems by 25% over the past three days.Apart from PM2.5, oxides of nitrogen, which form smog, also showed an increase in air composition. /According to an IITR scientist, ""There was a decrease in concentration of sulp hur dioxide but other pollutants like nitrogen dioxide have increased."" Lucknow also topped pollution levels in the state. It was followed by Agra with AQI of 449, Kanpur with AQI 436 and Varanasi with AQI 358. According to the live air quality monitoring station of Central Pollution Control Board, Talkatora turned out to be the most toxic during the daytime with pollution levels crossing 500 microgramscubic mt of air.With 512 mcgcubic mt of air, pollution level in the locality was eight times that of the permissible limit. Data from Lalbagh and Aliganj also indicated that toxic substances in the atmosphere kept rising all day .The concentration of PM2.5 was 484.8 mcgcubic mt of air in Lalbagh and 326.2 mcgcubic mt of air in Aliganj by the evening.

Air quality: State ignored warning signs for a mth,"LUCKNOW: The state capital recorded the worst-on-the-scale `severe' category air quality for the second consecutive day on Thursday . According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which found the city's Air Quality Index (AQI) value to be 468 on the day , `severe' air quality is bad enough to affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases.An analysis of CPCB data, however, reveals that little was done to avert the situation even though warning bells started ringing exactly a month ago. On October 10, the city recorded `poor' air quality after a long hiatus (See graphic on Page P2).Since then, 27 out of 30 days have seen `poor' or worse (`very poor' and `severe') air quality .There were no days during this period when the city's air quality was `satisfactory' or `good'.This contrasts sharply with the preceding month in which the city did not witness a single instance of poor air quality . In fact, on 10 days between September 10 and October 9, the air quality was either `satisfactory' or `good'. What makes the need for reforms more urgent in UP is the fact that five out of the 10 most polluted cities, as recorded on Thursday , are in the state.Requesting anonymity , a UPPCB official, however, claimed there was little that could have been done locally to arrest the steady rise in air pollution because its source is not in the state.""The air quality has deteriorated sharply primarily due to stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. /Pollutants from these states have been brought to the city through westerly winds,"" said the official. CSIR-IITR director Alok Dhawan said other factors that might have contributed are poor wind velocity , high humidity and rise in wood and garbage burning in the open due to dipping mercury. He said while there was indeed cause for alarm, CPCB figures, which are an average from three monitoring stations, are not truly representative of any particular location in the city. Dhawan said it's about time the government starts taking punitive action. ""Laws and guidelines need effective implementation"" he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
A not-so-cool time for elders as winter sets in,"Madurai: Respiratory and lung infections are on the rise among elders this season who are queuing up outside clinics and hospitals. Geriatricians say that the climatic condition and air pollution make it mandatory for elders to get their pneumococcal vaccination and ensure that they are adequately hydrated throughout winter.Geriatrician Dr N Raja, who treats elders from various parts of the city, said that the number of patients coming for treatment for lung related problems and fever has gone up this winter as compared to last year. ""Earlier, we used to have a regular flow of asthmatic patients when winter started, but now this has come down with many inhalers entering the market, all the same, lung related infections like pneumonia, bronchitis and breathlessness are on the rise, and it is not just the climate but also the pollution that is leading to it,"" he said.Raja said that senior citizens, who are smokers, diabetic or suffering from regular breathing problems, should get their pneumonia vaccine immediately if they have not already taken it. /A single vaccination will give them immunity for ten years which is the best way to overcome most of these seasonal lung related problems. It may not reduce all illnesses, but it may reduce the severity of the symptoms and also prevent complications, he added.He said that the number of fever cases are also much higher this year as compared to last year, one thing that elderly people have to keep in mind, is to ensure that they are adequately hydrated by consuming plenty of fluids even if they do not feel thirsty as it would help them overcome different kinds of fever, including dengue. When adequately hydrated, if a patient's condition deteriorates due to fever like dengue, their sudden circulatory collapse could be prevented. ""Patients who had prostrate problems on the other hand have to reduce fluid intake,"" he said. As sweating decreases they would tend to urinate often, which could aggravate their conditions.Itching is also a problem which is caused due to dry skin in winter, as there is not enough sweating to keep the surface moisturized. This can be prevented by applying moisturizing lotions rather than taking tablets as it could cause complications, he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
No one should be living in this city: Delhi doctors,"""Please help us save our children"" - that's the motive of a movement being spearheaded by a group of mothers and some of the biggest names from the capital's medical fraternity. They want the issue of Delhi's air pollution to go beyond just headlines, and into immediate action which not just the government, but every citizen as well, can undertake. Which is why, to drive home the point about just how hazardous our air pollution levels are, a dozen of the country's top doctors gathered near Rashtrapati Bhavan at 6.30am, to be photographed in the smog whose AQI (Air Quality Index) hovered around 815. No one should be breathing this air, they said. It will make you sick.(BCCL/ Ranjit Kumar)As the debate around Delhi's air risks turning into rhetoric, these mothers and doctors want to initiate action today, so that a toxic blanket is not all our future generations have left to breathe. ""#MyRightToBreathe is a citizens' movement trying to create mass-level awareness regarding pollution, and at the same time trying to find solutions collectively to help solve this problem. /This movement is being spearheaded by the doctors and mothers of our city backed by data from the best research specialists of the country. The mothers of this country are appealing to our prime minister to please address this issue which has been declared to be a national health emergency,"" says the group, some of whose members include Kalyani Saha Chawla, Radhika Kapur, Ravina Raj Kohli, Arjun Sharma, Barun Aggarwal, Bharti Chaturvedi, Gopal Shankarnaryanan, Jai Dhar, Namrata Datt, Parul Sharma, Ritika Jhanji, Shibani Thukral, Shifali Verma, Shubhani Talwar, Sunali Amla and Sunil Duggal. The medical fraternity is in complete agreement - our air is a national health emergency. It is ""not fit for human habitation"". It needs life support, and fast./Civil society has to raise its voice: Dr. Naresh TrehanPeople are alarmed, but they don't know what to do. They are looking towards the government for a solution. We know that solutions are there, but they require a lot of determination, hard work and a collaborative effort by civil society. These are things that we need to be serious about throughout the year, not only when the crisis hits. The health of this country is a matter of concern for both the central and the state government. They have to take it seriously, else, a lot of people are at risk. Today, 60-70% of the smog is coming from crop burning. For the sake of our children and all those who are suffering, we must raise our voice.Delhi is unfit for habitation: Dr Arvind KumarI would not call the present situation just alarming, it is unfit for human habitation. Ideally, if you are a health-conscious person, none of us should be living in this city. If this continues, we are going to see a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and lung cancer epidemic. There should be a ban on crackers across India. Farmers should be provided with alternatives to crop burning. The use of brooms should be stopped immediately. Dirt on the road is better than dirt blown into the air and going in our lungs.We will see the damage the air is causing in the years to come: Dr Anupam SibalWhen the Air Quality Index (AQI) hits 300 or 400, the air is bad not just for the vulnerable, like children or those with respiratory illness, heart conditions or the elderly. When the AQI deteriorates to the extent that it has, the air is bad for everyone. We see the consequence of breathing this air in those who have respiratory problems, but there is a lot of damage happening in the rest of the population as well. We will not be able to see it today, but we will see it in the years to come. There needs to be a collective effort, everyone needs to come together, because this is something that affects everyone.Start taking small steps inside the house: Dr Nitin VermaIt is a matter of shame that individuals and doctors are coming forward, but the people who should be here, the stakeholders, the government, are either sleeping or have decided not to do anything about the problem. You can't have a calamity like this happening every year. Being a paediatrician, I would like to talk about children - the future of tomorrow. We need food, shelter and air to survive, and look at the quality of the air. What are we creating for our children? Within the house, people can take small steps, like wet mopping and use vacuum cleaners if they can afford them.Girls exposed to this have a higher chance of breast cancer: Dr Sidharth SahniThe situation is catastrophic, and it has been for the last five years. The biggest reason behind this is crop burning. It has now become a biannual thing - it has started happening in the spring as well as at the onset of winter. If a girl in her 20s is exposed to this environment, at 40, her chances of getting breast cancer are six times higher. It is a problem which is affecting everyone. Farmers need to be given an alternative to stubble burning.You shouldn't step out if AQI is above 400: Dr Vivek NangiaWith time, people have become insensitive to the level of pollution around us. The approved AQI standard by WHO is 60, and the government has already stretched it to 100. Now, they don't even react until it is 400. For healthy people, it is recommended that if the level is above 400, they should stop going out. The AQI is 800 today, and we are still not reacting. It is an emergency situation and if we don't react now, it will be too late.Keeping multiple cars has become a fashion in Delhi: Dr Sunil DubeyThere is a six-fold increase in the number of patients coming in with respiratory problems. Earlier, in a month, we would get 10-12 patients, now that has increased by six times. We need to work on our lifestyle as well. Keeping multiple cars has become a fashion in Delhi. That attitude needs to change.You cannot escape this problem by leaving the city: Dr Nitish DograAt this point, crop burning is the primary problem. Another thing that happens throughout the year which people don't pay attention to is the use of the traditional chulha in rural areas. There are certain areas in the city that have the worst air quality - like Anand Vihar, Punjabi Bagh and RK Puram - they have most of the construction sites. You cannot escape this problem by leaving the city. In fact, people should not step out at this time because the AQI is not suitable for any of us.We are not educating people enough: Dr Alok ChopraEvery day, I am pained to see my patients suffering - especially the elderly, who have worked really hard to recover. We are not educating people enough, it needs education at all levels. We have to make people understand. Everybody is self-centred, we need to see the world as our society.Immediate action required to stop a catastrophe: Dr Navin DangWe were talking about pollution 20 years back, but now, it has become a reality. We are sitting on a volcano of lung issues and respiratory problems, and immediate action should be taken to stop a catastrophe.This is a national emergency: Dr Ashwani ChopraIt is truly a national emergency and each one of us has to take responsibility for it. We must mobilize people to make them aware and approach authorities to stop all sources of pollution. We are practising doctors, we see how people are suffering, especially elderly people. We must take this seriously./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Smog in Indore air? Wind is the saviour,"INDORE: While Delhi's smog condition is believed to have escalated because of crop burning, fire and smoke emitting at the trenching ground in Devguradia could also have led to the same situation in Indore if the wind pattern was different.Had it been the wind blowing towards the city, the impact of the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of garbage being dumped at the trenching ground in Devguradia could have made things worse like in the national capital.Delhi's air quality is believed to have plunged due to low temperature and high pollution level that seems to be the outcome of burning of crops in nearby region of the national capital. ""There is an increase in amount of smoke emanating at the trenching ground in Devguradia. But as the flow of wind is towards southeast direction, it has no impact on air quality of the city,"" said officials of MP Pollution Control Board (Indore region).""The condition is very good for us. /If the wind flows towards south-west direction it could lead to drastic increase in city's air pollution level. Efforts should be made to stop the smoke emanation or it could lead to serious hazard,"" he added. Officials also said that the level of pollution in Devguradia is around 200-300\xB5g/m3, while in city areas it is around 80\xB5g/m3. ""If the wind flow changes towards southwest direction, then it would lead to a drastic increase in level of air pollution in the city,"" they said.They further said that the flow of wind in this region remains from West to East or from East to West. ""Though it is rare, but if the wind pattern gets changed, then it would be a major risk for the citizens as those living near Devguradia area are already facing health issues,"" they added.An environmentalist from city Dr OP Joshi said that the velocity of wind and geological condition of Indore are favourable enough to prevent smog like in Delhi. ""Arrival of winter is another factor which has huge impact on smoke staying in Delhi air. Early arrival of winter and high pollution levels lead to plunge in air quality, which is not the case with Indore as of now,"" he added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Kharghar hill fire worsens pollution in PCMC nodes,"NAVI MUMBAI: It has been a nightmare weekend for residents of nodes like Kharghar, Taloja, Kamothe, Kalamboli and Panvel as the massive fire that broke out in the forested Kharghar hills has left the air highly polluted.The fire which started on Saturday evening near Taloja jail was doused only on Sunday afternoon. According to a fireman from Kharghar fire station, the fire engine failed to climb up the hill in the night. After the fire tenders received another call at 10am on Sunday, they reached the spot and doused the fire but it took them over two hours. /Range forest officer D S Sonawane said his team was summoned based on a resident's call to douse the fire which has spread to some acres. ""It was quite challenging to take control which prompted us to seek the help of villagers. The fire tender could not reach the spot at night but we were successful in reducing the magnitude of fire later. We will investigate the issue to weed out the causes,"" he added. A thick cover of smoke engulfed the nodes all through Sunday. It affected visibility on Sion-Panvel highway and Mumbai Pune Expressway. ""It was tough to ride past the highway from Panvel to Belapur due to the smoke,""a motorist said. Residents of all these nodes which fall under PCMC jurisdiction have also been complaining of breathlessness. They alleged that the civic agencies have been doing little to stop such fires which frequently break out along the Parsik mountain range as miscreants tend to light fires here. The smoke had spread all the way to CBD Belapur even though the fire was blazing a few kilometres away. Illegal brick kilns have been adding to the air pollution in these areas. This has posed serious health risks for children and the elderly in particular. The nearby industries too add to the water and air pollution. ""We have been feeling breathless due to the massive fire that has charred the green stretch on the hill. This is a regular phenomena which takes place every winter. This has been creating heavy pollution and it also affects the flora and fauna in the area, said Sudhir Patel, a city-based activist. Kharghar has become the epicentre of pollution. While on one side there is the MIDC industrial belt on Thane-Belapur road and on the other is Taloja MIDC where there are chemical units. When asked about the increasing pollution level in the area due to the smoke from the hill fire, Anil Mohekar, regional officer of MPCB said, ""We have nothing to do with the incidents like fire breakouts that added to the pollution levels. For other complaints related to pollution via brick kilns and untreated industrial effluents, we have written to the concerned agencies to comply with pollution norms.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Parking fee hike & improved public transport to help curb air pollution,"Pune: Enhancing parking fees and capacity augmentation of public transport are on top of the Central government's agenda to curb air pollution. Following the Centre's lead, the state government too is likely to take stringent action to stop private vehicles from hitting the roads.On Friday, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change had convened a meeting in New Delhi to deliberate on the air pollution problem and ways to mitigate it. It was decided that all concerned organisations of the Centre and state governments will work towards immediately implementing certain short-term measures. /Enhancing vehicle parking fee and capacity augmentation of public transport systems were discussed in detail. Maharashtra chief secretary Sumeet Mullick said the meeting was largely about the northern states, but added that the measures suggested in the meeting were applicable to cities in Maharashtra. ""Hike in parking charges will discourage people from taking out private vehicles. The state is already trying this at certain places. While increasing the parking fees, the state is also focusing on good public transport, and metro and mono rail projects are also being implemented,"" said Mullick. For most citizens, however, taking out private vehicles is a compulsion. ""I would like to travel by bus. But where is the connectivity and where are the buses?"" asked Chetana Dange, a college student. She travels by six-seaters, which emit a lot of black smoke, to reach her college in Dhankawadi. ""During the peak hours, the buses are crowded. We are forced to use the six-seater rickshaws. I am thinking of buying a two-wheeler soon,"" she said. She is not alone in wanting a private vehicle. About 22,000 new vehicles hit the city roads every month. While the Pune RTO registered more than 1.61 lakh two-wheelers, registrations in Pimpri Chinchwad reached 92,100 in last fiscal. The vehicle population in Pune till March 2017 was 33,37,370.A senior state cabinet minister said, ""A parking fee hike will evoke immediate reactions in cities like Pune, where two-wheelers dominate the roads and the public transport is not good.""""More and free parking is not a solution to the traffic problem,"" said Sujit Patwardhan, of Parisar, a citizens' group working for environmental awareness and education. According to a study by Parisar, public transport occupies less space, has lower emissions and consumes less fuel per passenger-per km when compared to private vehicles.Rajya Sabha MP Vandana Chavan too said the state government and the local governing bodies must give top priority to air pollution and environment-related issues. ""Climate change is a major cause for concern. It is high time that we support all efforts to mitigate climate change... be it protecting biodiversity parks or implementing projects to save energy or even stringent steps to control air pollution,"" she said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Top 8 main causes for air pollution in Delhi,"The toxic levels of air pollution in and around Delhi is creating quite a menace. Adding to the severity, the changing weather conditions have locked the pollutants in the air and made the situation worse. Doctors are warning people of dire consequences and discouraging them from stepping outdoors. But what are the reasons behind this soaring pollution?/ We tell you:National capital shares its border with the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. One of the main reasons of increasing air pollution levels in Delhi is crop burning by the farmers in these states. Farmers burn rice stubbles in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. It is estimated that approximately 35 million tonnes of crop are set afire by these states. The wind carries all the pollutants and dust particles, which have got locked in the air.Pollution caused by the traffic menace in Delhi is another reason contributing to this air pollution and smog. The air quality index has reached 'severe' levels. Vehicular emission is increasing the hazardous effects of air pollution and smog. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) have declared vehicular emission as a major contributor to Delhi's increasing air pollution.As the winter season sets in, dust particles and pollutants in the air become unable to move. Due to stagnant winds, these pollutants get locked in the air and affect weather conditions, resulting in smog.Another reason of air-pollution is over-population in the capital. Over-population only adds up to the various types of pollution, whether it is air pollution or noise pollution.Investing less on public infrastructure is another reason of air pollution. In India, investment in public transport and infrastructure is low which leads to congested roads, and hence air pollution.Large scale construction in Delhi-NCR is another culprit that is increasing dust and pollution in the air. Considering the dipping air quality, a number of construction sites have stalled work, as directed by the Delhi Government.Industrial pollution and garbage dumps are also increasing air pollution and building-up smog in the air.Despite the ban on cracker sales, firecrackers were a common sight this Diwali. It may not be the top reason for this smog, but it definitely contributed to its build up. National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued some guidelines to protect yourself against the hazardous impacts of smog and pollution: Don't step out or indulge in outdoor activities during early morning and evening hours due to ""severe"" levels of air pollution in the city. Try to stay indoors. Go out when it's bright and sunny. Avoid stepping out if you have breathing difficulty. Keep children indoors as much as possible. Avoid smoking. Do not burn garbage. Drink adequate amount of water as it helps in flushing toxins from the body. Avoid strenuous activity, as they may lead to inhalation of minute pollutants. Eat fruits that are loaded with vitamin C, magnesium and omega fatty acids. These fruits are rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds and helps in boosting immunity. Use nasal filters or air purifiers, which helps in short-term relief. Keep some air purifying plants inside your homes and offices such as aloe vera an English ivy. Avoid using main roads. It has been observed that pollution drops when you walk in lanes away from the main roads. Avoid going to areas with heavy smoke or dust./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
All's not well with Bodhi Tree,"GAYA: Unseasonal drying up of Bodhi Tree leaves has once again signalled all's not well with the revered tree that symbolises Lord Buddha's enlightenment. The present tree is said to be a direct descendant of the original peepal tree that provided shade to Buddha, then a wandering prince named Siddhartha, in the last week of his seven-week non-stop meditation at seven different points on the Mahabodhi Temple premises.Sources attribute the untimely drying up of the leaves to several factors, including soil compaction, bottlenecks in the sub- surface flow of nutrients, noise and air pollution caused by the presence of devotees and the tendency of the devotees to touch the tree.Earlier, plant scientists recommended restriction on the number of devotees entering the shrine at any point of time to limit the chances of soil compaction. However, the idea was not found suitable as it involved the religious sentiments of Buddha followers from across the world visiting the shrine to see the tree and offer prayers.Another recommendation of the experts was the replacement of sodium vapour lamps with low-voltage LED bulbs and complete darkness in the shrine vicinity between 10pm and dawn. /Though the lighting arrangement has been altered as per the recommendation, ensuring complete darkness during night hours for allowing the photosynthesis process to run its natural course has hit roadblocks.The experts also recommended replacement of marble slabs on the shrine premises with porous sand tiles to facilitate smooth flow of nutrients.When contacted on Monday, Gaya DM Kumar Ravi said the tree was not facing any major health hazard. There were minor irritants that were being taken care of.Asked about the recommendation regarding the cap on the number of temple entrants, the DM said it was not possible.""An awareness campaign will be launched among the visitors to educate them on the health hazards of the tree and the desirability of avoiding soil compaction caused by heavy footfall. The recommendation regarding the replacement of marble tiles has been partially implemented,"" said the DM who is also the ex-officio chairman of the shrine management committee.A few weeks back, tree branches fell off during the replacement of artificial props that provided support to outgrown branches.About a decade back, the tree was diagnosed with mealybug, a plant disease that, besides having debilitating effect on the plant, inhibits photosynthesis. As Bihar plant scientists failed to provide an effective remedy for the disease, the shrine committee signed an MoU with the Dehradun-based Forest Research Institute for bi-annual health check-up and treatment of the sacred tree./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'MC staff burning waste at site',"Mohali: Rules are being flouted with impunity in the district by burning leaves and garbage at several places despite the directions passed by Punjab and Haryana High Court.The residents of both Derabassi and Zirakpur alleged that burning of garbage is a common sight in their area. Pardeep Sharma, a resident of Derabassi said, ""Certainly the ban is there but the authorities seem to be least bothered about enforcing it. /We get to see garbage being burnt in our surroundings every second day. This is totally unhygienic. The smoke from the dump is harmful and can pose health hazards to the residents living around.""It has been alleged that the contractor and some of the employees of the municipal corporation (MC) instead of collecting the dry leaves and garbage into the trolley, dump them at a place and burn it there to avoid their hassle.Garbage are found burning near parks on the border and also near industrial area which create a lot of air pollution. Residents associations alleged that hundreds of people come to walk in the parks while thousands of children come to schools who are getting severely affected by the pollution created by the burning of garbage.They claimed that they have approached the civic authorities a number of times but in vain. They ahve so far taken no action against the contractor who is violating the norms.MLA N K Sharma said, ""We will look into the matter and whoever found guilty will be punished. Burning leaves and garbage is illegal and residents are welcome to put forward their complaints before me.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Shift Metro car shed out of Aarey: Mumbai mayor,"MUMBAI: Delhi's air pollution should serve as a lesson and the metro car shed must be moved out of Aarey colony, said Mumbai mayor Vishvanath Mahadeshwar.While the Shiv Sena has continued to maintain it is opposed to the Metro car shed and even rejected it in the draft Development Plan - 2034 marking all of Aarey as a green zone, chief minister Devendra Fadanvis who heads the urban development department has overruled it. In August it issued a notification deleting the 33 hectares of Aarey colony land for the metro car shed. Last week the department issued the final notification shifting the land from green zone to metro car shed.Mahadeshwar had visited the Metro III car-shed site on Friday where a presentation was made by Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd that is executing the project. /On Monday, members of the Aarey Conservation Group met him at his office at the BMC headquarters to garner support for their cause to save Aarey.""At the outset I want to make it clear that we are not opposed to the metro project. However, our concern is about the cutting of trees for the construction of the metro car shed which we are opposed to. Aarey is a green zone and must be maintained as such if Mumbaikars are to live a healthy life and not be prone to respiratory diseases,"" he said.Mahadeshwar pointed out that he is a teacher and said cutting of trees will increase carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur, methane and other Green House Gases. He said humanity is already facing problems on account of climate change and global warming. ""We have to approach this issue as a humanitarian problem. By 2038 Mumbai will be susceptible to a host of diseases.

""We have now sought a meeting with the Sena leadership which he has said he would help us with.""Activist Zoru Bathena said the mayor assured that the BMC would not issue the tree-cutting permissions./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Odd-even: Delhi to file review plea, city commuters worried","GURUGRAM: People commuting between Gurgaon and Delhi are worried about their everyday travel if the odd-even scheme is rolled out in the capital. They feel the intercity public transport system is in a very bad state. The Delhi government is expected to file a review petition in the NGT on Monday asking the green court to take a relook at exemptions for both women and two-wheelers.Currently, there are 200 DTC buses that travel between Delhi and Gurgaon and only 21 buses from Gurgaon go to Delhi.Office-goers expressed concern over lack of public transport between Delhi and Gurgaon and within Gurgaon. /""Air pollution is a matter of concern for everyone. Everyone's health is at stake. I completely support odd-even initiative.""However, intercity commute between Gurgaon and Delhi is almost impossible without private vehicles. There are hardly any buses. Metro only goes to a few places. Cab aggregators will apply surge pricing,"" said Vijay Garg, a resident of Lado Sarai who works on Sohna road.Many feel commute within Gurgaon is a major challenge. There are about 24,000 autos in the city, 200 city buses, 1,500 cabs, 600 e-rickshaws and 300 bike taxis in Gurgaon for intercity commute.""Travelling from Delhi to Gurgaon can be managed via Metro, but it is impossible to travel within Gurgaon without a private car. There is no public transport in Gurgaon, except for a few diesel autos that emit hazardous black smoke. ""The problem is we won't be able to bring our cars to the city. If Delhi wants to implement the odd-even scheme, there should be a good network of public transport in the entire NCR region,"" said Kuldeep Singh Rathi, a Delhiite who has a business in Gurgaon.Students from Delhi who study in Gurgaon are also a worried lot. As per an estimate, more than 3,000 children travel between Delhi and Gurgaon every day in about 100 school buses. ""We will face a lot of issues as you can't travel beyond Huda City Centre, the last DMRC station in Gurgaon. Often, taxi services are also not available early in the morning. I think schools in both Delhi and Gurgaon should be shut once odd-even is rolled out in Delhi, or authorities should make sure that NCR cities like Delhi have some options for public commute,"" said Sadhana Gupta, a resident of Vasant Kunj, who sends his children to a Gurgaon-based school in DLF 1. DMRC has already increased number of trips on the yellow line to Huda City Centre from 679 to 701 a day. ""DMRC is already running 3,317 train trips instead of 3,131 on all lines, an increase of 186 trips to provide increased capacity to public due to this weather. These trips are increased by inducting trains from operational maintenance reserve kept in the Metro train depots,"" said an official spokesperson of DMRC./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution: Is the worst over for India?,"NEW DELHI: The haze that blanketed Delhi last week was in the making over several days. As more and more among us develop respiratory complications from severe outdoor pollution and governments grapple with the menace, we take a look at air pollution around the world and why India, with China, continues to dominate pollution-related deaths.How does air pollution kill?Burning of fossil fuels like coal is the main source of air pollution, a fallout of increasing urbanisation and industrialisation. The two most common pollutants linked to fuel combustion and industrial activity are sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrous oxides (NOx). These react in the atmosphere to form particulate matter (PM). The tiniest microscopic particulate matter, less than 2.5 microns in size (a micron is a thousandth of a milimetre) and hence called PM2.5, is the most lethal because these lodge deep in the dense but fragile network of alveoli in our lungs, eventually leading to chronic lung disease and breathing distress./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"COPD, other air pollution related diseases on rise, says new health data","NEW DELHI: A new report released on Tuesday has concluded that air pollution is the second leading risk factor for disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a measure for overall disease burden in India. The ""Nations within a nation: variations in epidemiological transition across the states of India, 1990-2016 in the Global Burden of Disease Study"" published in The Lancet journal has found that child and maternal malnutrition followed by air pollution, dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, and diabetes were the major health risk factors in India in 2016.However, there are major variations across states depending on their development status. For example, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana experienced a higher health burden from air pollution compared to states like Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa and others. According to the report, the burden of air pollution was higher in low epidemiological transition level (ETL) states or states where the transition of disease burden from communicable diseases to non-communicable diseases is still slow compared to other states where conditions like blood pressure or high cholesterol had a higher disease burden compared to communicable diseases.""The proportion for air pollution-related DALYs was also higher in the low than in the high ETL state group. /Conversely, the proportion of total DALYs due to dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, high cholesterol, and high body-mass index were highest in the high ETL state group,"" the report said. The five leading causes of DALYs in India in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, and cerebrovascular disease according to the report. While air pollution was the third largest risk factor in 1990, it has moved up to the second leading risk factor in 2016 owing to rising air pollution levels across the country.Malnutrition continues to be the biggest risk factor since 1990. The medical experts led by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) who conducted the study found some causes of death and disability such as diarrhea and other communicable diseases have declined but others, especially heart disease - which is closely linked to air pollution and smoking - has increased significantly in the country, CSE researchers said reacting to the study. Delhi may be one of the most polluted cities but it faces a marginally lower health impacts possibly due to transition from solid fuels.

Meanwhile, the Lancet Commission on Health and Pollution has also sounded alarm bells on health impacts from air pollution. The Commission said 9 million deaths occur each year worldwide due to air water and chemical exposures. Air pollution is at the top of the list, with outdoor and indoor air pollution contributing to about 6 million deaths. India remains one of the worst affected where 1.9 million premature deaths occur due to outdoor and indoor air pollution./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Raj has highest deaths due to chronic pulmonary diseases in country,"Jaipur: Rajasthan is leading among states having highest deaths due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in the country in 2016, a national study, 'India: Health of the Nation's States' released in New Delhi on Tuesday, revealed the distressing figures. The study also shows that the state's air is highly polluted and Rajasthan is leading in the number of COPD and asthma deaths, while it is second in deaths due to lower respiratory infections.The figures of the study, which was prepared by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Public Health Foundation of India and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation through funding by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Indian Council of Medical Research, Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, was released in New Delhi on Tuesday. The study shows the disease burden trends in the states of India from 1990 to 2016. In 1990, the leading cause of deaths in Rajasthan was lower respiratory infections, which was 14%. With 13%, diarrheal diseases occupied the second spot. It was followed by tuberculosis (6.2%), preterm birth complications (5%), other neonatal disorders (4%), measles (3.5%) and COPD was at seventh spot with 3.4% deaths. /But, in 2016, COPD jumped from seventh position to second position with the number of deaths increasing from 3.4% to 7% in Rajasthan. Lower respiratory infections remained the leading cause of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY), 2016.""Deaths due to COPD are highest in Rajasthan because it is a state where bidi smoking is prevalent. Also, another leading cause of COPD is cooking on chulha, which produces a lot of smoke causing damage to lungs leading to COPD. Cooking on chulha is one of the sources of household air pollution. Rajasthan is also leading in household air pollution,"" said Dr Virendra Singh, who is one of the India State-level Disease Burden Initiative Contributors, helped in preparing the report on disease burden. In India, the leading individual cause of deaths in 2016 was ischaemic heart disease, the death rate from which was twice as much as the next leading cause-COPD, which is the second leading cause of death in the country, following stroke, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease among the non-communicable disease category, the report says. The report says, ""For household air pollution, too, the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) rate in 2016 was higher in the Empowered Action Group (EAG) states and Assam, with the highest rates in Rajasthan, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh. The DALY rate pattern for outdoor air pollution was more mixed, with the highest rates in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, followed by Punjab, Rajasthan, Bihar, and West Bengal.""Box:WHO says,Main risk factors for COPD are tobacco smoking, indoor air pollution (such as biomass fuel for cooking and heating), outdoor air pollution, occupational dusts and chemicals (vapours, irritants, and fumes).The most common symptoms of COPD are breathlessness, or a 'need for air', excessive sputum production, and a chronic cough.Dr Narendra Khippal, professor at Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Sawai Man Singh Medical College, Jaipur, says, females are at a higher risk for developing COPD as compared to males. This is because they have smaller and more sensitive lung mucosa. So, it affects women more quickly and more severely than men. People residing in rural areas are also at risk for cooking food on chulha, a common indoor pollutant in a closed environment./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Early detection crucial to COPD treatment,"Aurangabad: The Aurangabad Chest Association stressed on the need for raising awareness about different unconventional causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) disorder, timely diagnosis and advanced treatment available for respiratory diseases.Ashish Deshmukh, the head of department of MGM's chest department said that COPD is known to be a smoker's disease, but it is now found in non-smokers in significant numbers.The exposure to bio-mass fuels, air pollution and industry pollution are emerging as major causes of COPD. It is reported, at least one fourth patients suffering from COPD have never smoked. It becomes difficult to treat the patients when the cause is unidentified.""Diagnosis takes more time when the patient is a non-smoker,"" Deshmukh said stressing on the need cleaner atmosphere for COPD prevention.Pulmonary specialists also said lack of awareness about the disease and its treatment, ignorance about the ill-effects of smoking and bad air delay diagnosis and hamper treatment.Chest physician Iqbal Siddiqui said that COPD is a combination of diseases that were earlier known as two separate diseases, that is, chronic bronchitis and emphysema.Chronic cough, mucous formation and shortness of breath are the symptoms of COPD. /""At times, the inflammation of lungs and respiratory tract gets worse and leads to exaggerated symptoms,"" Siddiqui said.Doctors informed that there is no permanent cure for the disorder and therefore early treatment is crucial.""In COPD, reading the symptoms and seeking medical help if the symptoms persist is the key to controlling it,"" the physician said.Talking about management of COPD, Ashish Deshmukh said that inhalation therapy is an effective measure that people should know about.""By practicing healthy lifestyle, staying away from pollution and using inhaled corticosteroids as directed by physicians can alleviate the symptoms and improve quality of life,"" Deshmukh added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"After drop, level of pollutants remain above limits in city","Chandigarh: The level of pollutants continues to be above permissible limits in the city. After recording a drop in the level of pollution on Monday, the levels have witnessed a slight jump. The Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) recorded poor air quality on Tuesday.The air quality index (AQI), which has six categories -- good, satisfactory, moderately polluted, poor, very poor, and severe - hovered between 147 and 240 on Tuesday. /From the highest value (160) recorded on Monday, it jumped to 240. Tuesday's AQI was 240 (poor) at the Industrial Area, with repairable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) at 180 microgram per cubic metre (?g/m3) against a permissible limit of 100 ?g/m3. The particulate matter (PM 2.5) was 102 ?g/m3 against a permissible limit of 60. The AQI at PEC university in Sector 12 was 147 with RSPM and PM2.5 recorded at 137 and 74, respectively.The UT environment director, Santosh Kumar, said that low wind had led to a slight rise in the air pollution level. The weather department has predicted further improvement around November 15, when the western disturbances are expected to bring light showers to the city.The smog which chocked the city in the last one week is harmful to health. According to health experts, this type of smog can cause eye irritation, skin allergies and bronchial infections. In the last one week, PGI doctors received a higher number of cases of aggravated pulmonary diseases due to smog. They said there was 50% increase in the number of patients as compared to last week.BOX: What is causing smog?- The smoke or aerosol particles in the atmosphere act as a seeding nuclei, leading to the formation of condensed ice particles and occurrence of smog.- The primary pollutant particles suspended in the atmosphere over the past two weeks become secondary pollutants under the influence of sunlight, leading to the formation of dense smog./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Parents, teachers divided but schools to open today","GURUGRAM: All schools in the city will reopen from Tuesday even as air quality index remained in the 'severe' category at 466 on Monday. All schools were asked to remain closed from November 10 to 13 in view of the killer haze that enveloped Delhi-NCR. Parents and teachers are, however, divided over the district administration's decision.""Due to high pollution levels in Delhi-NCR and to avoid exposure of small children to pollution, we ordered the closure of schools last week. /Now it has been decided that all schools - government and private - will open from Tuesday. The timings of schools will be from 9.00 am to 3.30 pm,"" said deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh. ""We have, however, issued an advisory to schools to suspend all outdoor activities and sports events for the time being to avoid the exposure of children to pollution,"" he added.While some parents and teachers backed the district administration, saying closing down of schools is a temporary solution and not a permanent one, others disagreed. Trisha Sharma, whose child studies in SCJ World Academy, said, ""Shutting down schools is never the solution. I feel that to curb pollution, authorities need to take up stringent steps and not ask kids to stay at home."" Preeti Talrej, a parent of a child who studies in The Millennium School, Sohna Road, agreed, ""Schools should reopen tomorrow and if the situation gets worse, then only they should take some action.""But there were few others who thought the decision was wrong. ""As far as study is concerned, it is very important, but most important thing is the health of a child. I can't send my child out to smoke 20 cigarettes a day. I would request for a pollution vacation till the time it is controlled,"" said Himani Khare, whose child studies in Ryan International School, Sector 14. School authorities always knew that the decision to shut down was temporary.

Metro car shed must not remain in Aarey: Mayor,"MUMBAI: The tussle between the Shiv Sena and the BJP intensified on Monday when mayor Vishvanath Mahadeshwar said the metro car shed must be moved out of the verdant Aarey Milk Colony. The Shiv Sena politician said Delhi's air pollution crisis should serve as a lesson to the city.The mayor's statement is seen as mere rhetoric as the state government has already cleared the metro shed inside Aarey colony. The Shiv Sena has continued to oppose the shed and even rejected it in the draft Development Plan 2014-34, marking all of Aarey as a green zone. /Chief minister Devendra Fadanvis, who heads the urban development department, overruled it. In August, a notification separated 33 hectares of Aarey land for the metro car shed. Last week the department issued the final notification shifting the land from green zone to metro car shed.Mahadeshwar had last Friday visited the Metro III car shed site, where a presentation was made by the Mumbai Metro Rail Corp Ltd (MMRCL). On Monday, members of the Aarey Conservation Group met him at the BMC headquarters.""We are not opposed to the metro project, but concerned about tree-cutting for the shed. Aarey is a green zone and must be maintained as such,"" Mahadeshwar said. The mayor said raised the issues of climate change and global warming.

"Vehicles emit smoke, thumb nose at police","PATNA: Ever stranded on a bike in a traffic snarl right behind the omnipresent yellow city bus in Patna? You end up gasping for breath as your face gets covered with the thick black smoke emitted by the bus.Transport and police officials estimate at least 60% of the public transport vehicles being run by private players in Patna pose health hazards to the residents and cause air pollution. Worse, they add, they cannot act against them as they are armed with PUC (pollution under control) certificates, albeit bogus ones procured from private agencies. /The number of such vehicles plying in the city is in thousands. From the financial years 2012-13 till October this year alone, according to the transport department, at least 18,797 autos and 5,649 buses were registered to ply in the state capital.""Once I stopped a bus emitting thick, black smoke near Gandhi Maidan, but the driver flaunted the PUC paper and I had to let him go,"" a police officer told TOI on Wednesday.Such vehicles have a valid permit issued by the transport department to ply on the city roads provided they possess other legal documents, including the PUC which is issued after the vehicle passes a test to check that its emissions meet the pollution control standards. A PUC certificate is a mandatory document requirement for a vehicle under the Central Motor Vehicle Rule, 1989, sources said.There are in the city around 20 to 25 outlets which have been authorised by the transport department to issue PUC certificates after proper tests. However, it is an open secret that most of them issue the certificates without conducting any test - on payment of a premium.""We do not have adequate wherewithal to expose the 'fakism',"" a senior traffic police officer said, explaining the city's traffic police have just one equipment that can record the harmful emissions of vehicles.Environmentalist Ashok Ghosh said carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide along with other hydrocarbons adversely affect the environment and health. Vehicles using inferior quality fuel and fuel mixed with kerosene only aggravate the situation.""Asthmatic or allergic people should strictly avoid standing near such vehicles. Even a healthy person may fall sick if exposed to their emissions,"" Ghosh said.Plying of vehicles older than 15 years has been banned by the Supreme Court. Even the Bihar government announced a ban the 15-year-old vehicles after CM Nitish Kumar chaired a review meeting of state environment department in June last year. Soon thereafter, the Patna district administration launched a drive to seize such vehicles.

CSE shocked at report on Delhi kids' health,"NEW DELHI: Centre for Science and Environment expresses deep shock at the dubious death tally and massive loss of healthy live years due to illness from growing air pollution in Delhi and the country. Today the leading medical and public health experts of India came together under the aegis of the Indian Council of Medical Research, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to release the first ever systematic assessment of burden of disease at both the national and state level in India. The report notes progress in increasing life expectancy across the nation and in all states, although the improvements are varied substantially across the states. But warn that air pollution remains the second most important risk factor nationally. /Track the pollution level in your city Simultaneously the Report of the Lancet Commission on Health and Pollution has looked at the full range of environmental health risks reporting, based on the systematic Global Burden of Disease estimate. This shows some 9 million deaths occur each year worldwide due to air water and chemical exposures. Air pollution is at the top of the list, with outdoor and indoor air pollution contributing the lion's share, some 6 million deaths. India remains one of the worst affected where 1.9 million premature deaths occur due to outdoor and indoor air pollution. This strong evidence makes it clear that comprehensive and long-term strategies for reducing air pollution are critical to protecting public health. At the same time they note that this is likely an underestimate; there are many exposures for which the data is not yet strong enough to quantify the effects. Highlights of the State Level Disease Burden: -- The medical experts lead by the ICMR and IHME have documented the main causes of death and disability over the last quarter century, noting that some causes such as diarrhoea and other communicable diseases have declined but others, especially heart disease - which is closely linked to air pollution and smoking - has increased significantly in the country. -- When they examined the greatest risk factors for these diseases, especially for their ability to cause loss of healthy years of life lost, they found air pollution outdoors and indoors to be the number two risk factor nationwide, surpassed only by continuing impacts of maternal and child nutrition... Delhi caught in deadly health transition: The state level record exposes the following: -- Since 1990 overall life expectancy has gone up from about average 64 years to 73 years in 2016 in Delhi. But the quality of life shows significant decline as the overall disease burden in the city has increased. The shares of non communicable diseases that are largely affected by the environmental risk factors including air pollution are increasing very rapidly affecting all age groups. Even though the share of communicable diseases has come down, this benefit has been offset by the dramatic increase in non-communicable dieses. -- Diseases that are worst affected by air pollution including cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases (COPD), and cancers have shown dramatic increase since 1990. In 1990 COPD was ranked 13 among leading causes of illness and lost life years. But this has now shot up to rank 3. Similarly, Ischemic heart disease that greatly influenced by air pollution has gone up from rank 5 to number 1; and diabetes from rank 22 to rank 5 and stroke from rank 16 to rank 15. -- Making mockery of the population dividend, the younger age group in the city (40-69 years age), more than 60 per cent of them, are affected in varying proportion by chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancers. This age group contributes 41 per cent of total deaths in the city. -- Ischemic heart disease and lower respiratory infections are the top two leading causes of deaths among female and males. In fact the GBD has already established that in India more than 50 per cent of the premature deaths that is triggered by air pollution are from ischemic heart disease. Children - high risk group, says new study in Journal of Indian PediatricsIt is scary to note on Children's days that another most recent study in Delhi on children released recently in the Journal of Indian Pediatrics provides powerful evidences that show children growing up in polluted environments of Delhi have reduced lung growth compared to the children in developed countries like the US. Indian children have slower growth of lungs and reach a final size that is lower than that of Caucasian White children in the US. While both Indian and US children have nearly the same size till the age of about 8 years when the lungs complete their normal physical growth, subsequent growth show progressively difference between the two countries. Both boys and girls have lungs that are about 10 per cent smaller when they become adults in India.This study has been done by Prof SK Chhabra, former Director-Professor at Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute and now Head of Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Primus Hospital in New Delhi. The study highlights that air quality and childhood infections influence lung growth besides genetic factors. Air pollution retards lung growth in Delhi children. Even Indian adults have smaller lungs than their US counterparts. Smaller lungs mean poorer exercise capacity and greater vulnerability to respiratory symptoms and diseases. This is scary knowing that 40 per cent of urban children live in cities.Stop denial. Act now""If this does not wake us up to the health emergency, what will? Those who are in denial of environmental pollution-related deaths and illness in India should understand that the scary death tally and illness of Indians and children makes a mockery of India's growth story. India will have to do drastically a lot more to reduce pollution exposure and not less of it. It will be criminal not to act on the mounting health evidences and ask for more evidences from our own children, elderly and vulnerable. Indian lung is not different from others,"" says Anumita Roychowdhury, Executive Director, research and Advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment.\xB7 Mandate all cities of India to implement clean air action plan in a time bound manner and fix responsibility to meet clean air standards. \xB7 Pollution hotspots like Delhi will have to implement emergency plan as per the graded response action plan to address health emergency. \xB7 Quickly roll out comprehensive action plan for all sources of pollution in a time bound manner to for longer term action and systemic reforms for sustained air quality gains. o Ensure massive energy transition to bring clean fuels in transport, industry, power sector and in households; o Ensure massive mobility transition to bring clean technology, reduce car trips and scale up integrated public transport with efficient last mile connectivity o Ensure paradigm shift in waste management to control waste burning, construction waste and crop waste./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Patna air pollution worse than that of Delhi,"PATNA: Air pollution in Patna on Wednesday deteriorated further to 'very severe' category as the air quality index (AQI) released by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) was recorded at 404, worse than Delhi's 308. This is the first time this year that the AQI level crossed the 400 mark./Patna was, in fact, the sixth most polluted city in the country in terms of AQI level, which was the highest at Lucknow (486), followed by Ghaziabad (467), Kanpur (448), Moradabad (420) and Noida (410)./Track the pollution level in your city/The AQI is an assessment of the air quality taking into account eight pollutants: PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 micron), PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 micron), nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, ammonia and lead./Alarm bell starts ringing once pollution crosses the 300 mark. AQI of 400 and above is unbreathable and harmful for health. The severe category AQI affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases./The AQI in Patna had last crossed 400 mark in November-December 2015 and the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) had issued an advisory to various departments and agencies for taking immediate steps to curb air pollution in the city./While BSPCB officials said reminders are being sent to various departments and agencies with regard to implementation of the recommendations made in the previous advisory, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said the prevailing air pollution scenario in Patna would be reviewed to chalk out an action plan./""Though the air pollution scenario in Patna in not as grave as Delhi, but it might reach such level if required actions are not taken. I have asked officials from forest department and BSPCB to gather all types of data to be discussed in a review meeting to take immediate steps for curbing air pollution in the city,"" SuMo, who is also the environment and forest minister, told TOI./The 24-hour concentration of particulate matter, being the biggest contributor to AQI in Patna, was measured at 360.65 micrograms per cubic metre on Wednesday afternoon, six times higher than the respective standards./Suspended road dust particles, vehicular emission and smoke from brick kilns have been linked to higher level of respiratory suspended particulate matter (PM10) in Patna. WHO, in October 2013, had classified outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic (cancer causing agents) to humans./Pollution control officials also attributed the surge in air pollution level to winter conditions. ""The low temperature makes the air denser, which makes the particulate matter stuck in the lower level of atmosphere. The situation is further aggravated by fog at this time of the year, which leads to further trapping of particulate matter,"" a BSPCB scientist said./On the lines of Delhi, BSPCB has also formulated a graded response action plan (GRAP), which will put into action a number of anti-pollution measures and there will be specific actions for each category - moderate to poor, very poor, severe and emergency.

With the air quality index (AQI) crossing 400- mark in the state capital, the pollution level in the city is posing serious health risks to residents, especially children and elderly people. The worst is the impact of particulate matter, which invades the lungs and triggers respiratory diseases and even cancer. /Health experts said advisory for higher AQI prescribes minimal outdoor exposure at times of high pollution. Many physicians also suggest curtailing outdoor exercises and jogging in high air pollution conditions.""Air pollutants trigger allergies, cough, viral fever, lung infections, high blood pressure, asthma, anxiety, tiredness, diabetes, heart disease and irreversible lung damage. Number of patients with complaints of such ailments in Patna has increased almost by 20% over the past couple of weeks. Moreover, the viral and respiratory ailments tend to prolong as the body is unable to recover due to temperature variation and pollution. A strong pathogen seems to have developed due to spread of diseases like chikungunya and dengue, which is suspected to be leading to prolonged viral ailments,"" city-based physician Diwakar Tejashwi said.However, the authorities are mostly seen taking corrective steps only ""on paper"". Health experts suggest that a few steps like using respirator mask and air purifier at home, cutting down on early morning outdoor activities like jogging and walking and keeping plants that can cleanse the air at home will be of great help.While anti-pollution masks top the chart in the measures to combat pollution, health experts also suggest air purifiers to tackle indoor pollution. There are a number of air- purifiers available in the market, including carbon purifiers, which uses activated carbon as an absorbent and takes in impurities. Similarly, ionic air purifiers, which works based on ionisation of air particles, are also suggested. Ozone and ultraviolet purifiers are also available in the market, which clear the air inside the house by oxidising and using ultraviolet rays, respectively.""Air purifiers help in improving the indoor air quality by removing smaller allergens like dust, smoke and chemicals among other pollutants. Its demand is gradually rising in Patna. The longer the air purifiers work, the cleaner the air gets,"" said Ashok Videsariya, owner of an electronics shop on S P Verma Road.The demand for respirator mask has also increased in the city lately. Pharmaceutical store owners said respirator masks with N99, N95 or P100 rating or certification from the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) are highly effective in preventing pollutants to go inside the nose. The NIOSH N95 mask can filter 95% of particles greater than 0.3 microns, which is even smaller than PM2.5.""The N95 masks are in huge demand. These masks are priced in the range of Rs 50 to Rs 250. Apart from masks manufactured by Indian manufacturers, Chinese masks are also high in demand because of their relatively low price,"" said Prabhat Kumar, a pharma shop owner on Govind Mitra Road.WHAT TO DO?* Use carbon, ionic, ozone and ultraviolet air purifiers* Avoid early morning walks and heavy exercises that can cause strain on lungs* Keep plants inside home/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Life expectancy improves in state, women fare better than men","Jaipur: Life expectancy in the state has improved significantly from 1990 to 2016, according to 'India: Health of the Nation's States', a national study released in New Delhi on Tuesday.The female population in the state has added more years to their lives in comparison to the male counterparts. Over the span of 26 years, female life expectancy has increased by 10.7 years while that of males have improved by 8.3 years, the report says.The study was done by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Public Health Foundation of India and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, ICMR, Department of Health Research and ministry of health and family welfare.""What is cause of concern is the increasing gap of life expectancy between males and females from 1990 to 2016. The probable reasons could be the decreasing exposure of women to household pollution and increasing exposure of men to outdoor pollution,"" said Dr Virendra Singh, director, Asthma Bhawan, who is one of the contributors to the India State-level Disease Burden Initiative.The report says that in 1990, the life expectancy of females was 59.4 years, but it increased to 70.1 years in 2016. So, it has improved by 10.7 years. Among males, it was 57.2 years in 1990, which increased to 65.5 years. /It has improved by 8.3 years.The gap between life expectancy of females and males in 1990 was 2.2 years and it has increased to 4.6 years in 2016. The gap has more than doubled.As for life expectancy in the country, it is 70.3 years among females and 66.9 among males in 2016. It was 59.7 years in females and 58.3 among males in 1990. So, there has been a significant improvement in life expectancy in the country.The study elaborated the leading causes of deaths in different age groups in 2016. It shows that among 0-14 years population, 41.7% of deaths were caused by diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections; 36.6% caused due to neonatal disorders.According to the study, the risk factors that were driving most death and disability combined in 2016 were malnutrition, air pollution, tobacco use, dietary risks, high blood pressure, water, sanitation and hygiene, high total cholesterol, high fasting plasma glucose, alcohol and drug use and occupational risks./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Suicide biggest killer of youth in 2016: Union min report,"DEHRADUN: More young people in the age group of 15 to 39 years in the country died because of suicides than any other causes last year, according to a report -- ‘India: Health of the Nation’s States 2017’ -- that was released by the Union health ministry a few days ago. The report, prepared jointly by the department of health research of the ministry in association with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Public Health Foundation of India and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, found that “self-harm which includes suicides and other non-fatal outcomes was one of the leading contributors to the injury burden in India.”/As many as 18 of the 32 states and Union territories surveyed in the report recorded maximum deaths of youth due to suicide rather than diseases like TB, AIDS or cancer in 2016. Leading the list was Tripura which recorded 25.2% deaths of the total deaths in the age group 15 to 39 years in 2016 due to self-harm followed by Tamil Nadu (25%),Kerala (24.4%), Karnataka (22.9%) and West Bengal (20.6 %). Among the other states with high suicide percentages were Maharashtra (16.2%), Himachal Pradesh (15.4%), Sikkim (14.6%), Meghalaya (14.1%) and UP (13.6%)/Self-harm caused 29.8% more disease burden in 2016 than it did in 1990, according to the report which added that the trend had “increased among both sexes in the past 26 years although it was more among men than women.” The study indicated that “lifestyle changes that come with a rapidly industrialising, urbanising society, from changes in diet and activity level to more traffic on the roads, were possible reasons behind the trend./Lalit Dandona, distinguished professor of the Public Health Foundation of India, one of the collaborators in the report, told TOI that ""further exploration on the reasons behind the self-harm deaths will be done in the next stage of the report which will be out in a couple of months""./In studies carried out by other organisations as well in the past few years, suicide has emerged as the leading cause of death among youngsters in India. The Lancet Commission on Adolescent Health and Well-being in a study of 10-to 24-year-olds in the country in 2013 reported 62,960 such deaths. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 that tracked death from 306 diseases, injuries and risk factors across 188 countries, suicide was reported as the biggest killer of 15- to 24-year-olds in India, followed by road traffic accidents./The health ministry report also lists road mishaps as the major cause of death of the country’s youth population with much of North India reporting the maximum casualties in accident deaths. Jammu and Kashmir (20.9 %) leads in such deaths followed by Uttarakhand (17.7%), Punjab (16.2 %), Haryana (16.2%), Rajasthan (14.2%) and UP (12.4%)./Incidentally, chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) have been identified as another major killer of the youth population. These include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, occupational lung diseases and pulmonary hypertension which are caused due to tobacco smoke, air pollution and frequent lower respiratory infections during childhood./Highest cases related to CRD deaths were reported among the youth of Punjab (21.7%) followed by Tamil Nadu (16.6%), West Bengal (15.7 %), Delhi (14.9%), AndhraPradesh (14.9%) and Kerala (14.8%) in 2016./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
City students develop a robot prototype to fight pollution,"Ludhiana: From a bot which can help you in delivering a gift to your beloved to a bot, which will help you to decide on the best travel destinations, today bots can solve a lot of problems. But how about a bot, which can trap solar radiations with the help of solar panel and convert them into store energy. This is a bot, which can minimize the pollution level of the city.Two students of Class XI of Bhartiya Vidya Mandir Kitchlu Nagar Ludhiana - Raunaq Jain and Preeti Gaba - have prepared a prototype titled Solar Bot, a renewable energy robot in vehicles. /This prototype is based on the mechanism of trapping solar radiations with the help of solar panels that can convert them into stored energy. This will help in reducing the exploitation of the non-renewable resources in the city, which is being affected by air pollution caused due to the smoke coming out of the auto rickshaws.The students were helped by their teachers - Sangeeta Gupta and Tarun Arora - to develop the robot. With the help of diode, the battery of this robot prototype gets recharged. The students have developed the prototype using two medium motors and four light sensors programmed under the ambient light reflector, which moves the motor in rotation and revolution to trace the position of the sun.Sangeeta Gupta, who teaches science, said that she informed the students about the rising pollution level and how Ludhiana is becoming one of the most polluted cities in India. Meanwhile, Preeti said that this robot has the power to trap solar energy and convert it into chemical energy. ""This can be used as an alternate to petrol and diesel,"" she said. According to Raunak Jain, this eco-friendly device provides a simple solution to control the pollution level in the city and that too at a low cost. The maintenance cost of this robot prototype is Rs 30,000 per annum. ""You need not worry about its maintenance regularly,"" said Jain.Principal Neelam Mittar appreciated the efforts of the team as it takes a step forward to make the city pollution-free./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Chandigarh air quality records improvement,"CHANDIGARH: Finally, the quality of air in the city is showing some signs of improvement.The air quality index (AQI), which has six categories -- good, satisfactory, moderately polluted, poor, very poor and severe, was recorded between 123 and 173 on Thursday at two locations from where data was collected by the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC).On Thursday, the highest AQI was 173 (moderate) at PEC university with repairable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) at 112 microgram per cubic metre (?g/m3) against a permissible limit of 100 ?/g/m3. The particulate matter (PM 2.5) was 82 ?g/m3 against a permissible limit of 60. The AQI at the industrial area was 123 (moderate) with RSPM and PM 2.5 recorded at 132 and 67, respectively. Environment director of UT Santosh Kumar said wind had led to fall in the level of air pollution.The weather department has predicted further improvement in the coming days when the western disturbances are expected to bring light showers to the city. The smog which had choked the city in the last one week is considered harmful for health. According to health experts, this type of smog can cause eye irritation, skin allergies and bronchial infections.In the last one week, PGI doctors received a higher number of cases of aggravated pulmonary diseases due to the smog.

A'bad foul air advisory wake-up call for Rajkot tooDeadly pollutant going undetected,"Rajkot: The pollution advisory issued in Ahmedabad on Wednesday is a wake-up call for Rajkot too. The city, which has been winning accolades for its green energy initiatives, is still struggling to process the piling mount of garbage at Nakrawadi village near the city. Daily, nearly 600 tonnes of solid waste generated in the city is dumped at Nakrawadi site, which has already made living a hell for several villages nearby.Interestingly, Rajkot was the only city from India to find mention in the World Bank report on initiatives taken to improve public services using technology. /The recognition came for the Rs 69 crore 'Eye Way' project that also includes 20 air pollution sensors installed at various places in the city along with the CCTV network. However, these sensors have missed out on the most important pollution indicator - particulate matter, PM 2.5 and PM 10 are the key components that determines air quality index (AQI). Even without this parameter, AQI in many areas is above the 100 benchmark. Particulate matters are those which our nose is unable to filter out and goes directly into the lungs.Ecologist and retired professor of Saurashtra University Dr Siddharth Pathakm said, ""I have sent an email to municipal commissioner Banchha Nidhi Pani, drawing his attention that sensor system lacks the most significant parameter PM 2.5 and PM 10, which directly affect the health of citizens."" However, Pani said that this parameter is not required because Rajkot doesn't have industrial pollution and just vehicular pollution. Pathak, however contested this reason. ""Without calculation of PM in the air, we don't get the real picture of pollution."" The major reason for pollution in the city is vehicular pollution. The three-wheeler goods vehicle, commonly known as 'chhakdo', is one of the major pollutants on the roads. Former municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra had initiated the process to prohibit chhakdas on the city roads. But the proposal is gathering dust.Environment activist Shailendrasinh Jadeja said, ""RMC doesn't have facility to process this garbage and solid waste is continuously dumped. After Hanjar Biotech was blacklisted following National Green Tribunal (NGT) order on my petition, no new company has been engaged to process the waste. In its own affidavit filed in NGT, RMC said, ""The closing down of processing plant would not only be dangerous for the environment, but also result in spreading of epidemic diseases."" When asked, Pani said, ""Dumping will not pollute the air. We have a landfill site too. Garbage pollutes the air only when it is burnt.""Times ViewThe Pirana garbage dump in Ahmedabad is spewing noxious fumes as small fires are constantly burning there. The methane trapped inside leads to fires, sometimes big ones. It won't be surprising if something similar happens at Nakrawadi site where the solid waste is only piling due to lack of processing facility. It would be a folly to assume that there won't be fire there. RMC should wake up and initiate the process to bring in another company to start processing the garbage. Also, prohibiting the three-wheeler chhakdas looks a workable solution as far as vehicular pollution is concerned. Also, the civic body can find out other ways to keep a tab on particulate matter if the present sensors can't./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"After SDMC notice to not use coal in tandoors, Delhi restaurateurs worry about change in taste","Delhi restaurants might soon have to adjust to a change in their tandoori menu, after the SDMC (South Delhi Municipal Corporation) issued a notice to restaurants in south Delhi to stop using coal in tandoors. Environmentalists say that the ash from coal contributes to air pollution, and cutting down on the usage of coal will help improve air quality. Gurgaon administration has already imposed a blanket ban on the use of coal in eateries across the city. When we visited eateries in Delhi recently, most restaurateurs and their staff members told us that they are using traditional tandoors to make tandoori kebabs and other items. /When asked if they're planning to switch to gas-based appliances, some told us that they have ordered them, while most of them are yet to decide, with managers speculating that the dishes minus tandoor will not have the same taste. However, environmentalists maintain that Delhi is dealing with an emergency and so coal should be banned with immediate effect. An SDMC official said, ""We will take legal action against restaurants who do not stop using coal or firewood."" We use charcoal, not coal: RestaurateursOne of the points mentioned in the interim order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) dated 31.05.2016 is that restaurants and eateries should stop usage of coal in tandoors. However, restaurateurs say they use charcoal instead of coal. Varun Duggal, Head of Alliances at Massive Restaurants, tell us, ""We use tandoors at Farzi, Masala Library and many other restaurants. But we don't use coal, we use charcoal instead, which contains less sulphur and so it doesn't have as dangerous pollutants as coal.We have received notices from the authorities and we are planning to take it up and discuss with them."" A restaurateur says, ""Delhi has not ordered any blanket ban on the use of coal in eateries, it is one of the suggestions from the NGT. But the authorities are now forcefully implementing it. We need time to look for alternatives, it can't be changed in a day. Also, for foodies, it's not going to be a welcome change."" Restaurants should immediately ban both charcoal and coal: EnvironmentalistsAn IIT-K study which was commissioned by the Delhi government in 2012 had pointed out that there are approximately 9,000 hotels/restaurants in Delhi, which use coal (mostly in tandoors). It says, ""The Particulate Matter (PM) emission in the form of fly ash from this source is large and contributes to air pollution."" It was proposed in the 2015 report that all restaurants with sitting capacity of more than 10 should not use coal and shift to electric or gas-based appliances. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of the Centre for Science and Environment, agrees, ""We have to deal with the situation like an emergency. All the restaurants should immediately ban using coal in tandoors. We can't sit and discuss the pros and cons of every step now, we have crossed that phase. Now, each one of us needs to play his role in reducing pollution, in whichever way possible."" Most of the restaurateurs told us that they use charcoal instead of coal which has the least amount of sulphur, and so, it will not affect the environment. Anumita says, ""It is true that charcoal has lesser sulphur than coal. But it is not in the approved list of fuels by the Delhi government, as per my understanding. It is a health emergency, and Delhi can't afford even that level of smoke.""'We have ordered gas based tandoors for trials'Eateries in South Delhi received the notice about the coal usage in their kitchen some time back. To avoid any trouble, some of them have decided to order gas tandoors. Umang Tewari, owner of Local and The Junkyard Cafe, says, ""Even as the restaurants in south Delhi have received a notice from the SDMC, the restaurants in CP haven't received it notification yet. After receiving the notice, we ordered gas tandoors and we will try them. Permanent changes can be made only after receiving feedback from the guests. But the big question is, isn't it energy wastage as both cooking gas and electricity supplies are short?""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"In hinterland of toxic dump yard, locals gasp, ready to move court","HYDERABAD: Controversy over widespread groundwater pollution near the Jawahar Nagar dump yard took a political turn on Tuesday with hundreds of BJP supporters protesting against the government's refusal to scout for an alternative landfill site. Amberpet MLA G Kishan Reddy led the protest, shouting slogans against the government. Many of the protesters also covered their faces with cloth, saying it was the only way to breathe in the area. /Those living nearby are forced to cover themselves up fully before venturing out of homes. Jawahar Nagar sees 4,500 metric tonnes of garbage being dumped withinits premises every day. This has led to massive groundwater pollution, with leachate from the site contaminating a vast spread of area. The toxic leaks from the 60m tall garbage mountains flow into residential areas and streets during the rains. The groundwater directorate has confirmed that the water is heavily laced with harmful chemicals. An earlier study conducted by the Centre for Water Resources said the amount of Total Dissolved Salts (TDS) in the groundwater was enough to cause kidney stones and heart diseases. ""If we collect water in a vessel, a film of pollutants, which looks like oil, appears on it,"" said Sai Prasad, an RTI activist. The effect of pollution can be seen as far as Kapra, Keesara and Dammaiguda.Taking stock of the alarming situation, the local Medical Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) is preparing legal documents to approach the court. The committee consist of local residents, environmentalists, scientists and advocates. The MEPC is insisting that recycling of waste be done in a scientific manner. ""We will approach the court within 10 days as the authorities have deprived us the right to life by carrying out recycling of waste in an unscientific manner,"" said environmental activist K Purushotham Reddy, who is also an advisor to the MEPC. The BJP protesters on Tuesday, however, demanded that the dump yard be completely shifted. ""We already suffer due to the rancid smell, air pollution and mosquito menace due to the dump yard. Our condition worsens during heavy downpour as the leachate, along with rain water, flows into our streets,"" said Tirumal Reddy, a resident of Cheeryala, the most affected village. According to GHMC solid waste management superintending engineer Koteswara Rao, they are now capping the landfill as per solid waste management rules. The GHMC has proposed to cap 102 acres of the dump yard at an estimated cost of `146.95 crore. ""Leachate will also be sent to Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) before being dumped. The cost of this project is estimated at `25.72 crore,"" a top GHMC official saidTIMES VIEWThe Jawahar Nagar landfill has been wreaking environmental havoc in nearby areas for a long time. This has been mostly due to the unscientific treatment of waste and leachate that contaminates groundwater.

Elaborating further, he pointed towards the increasing number of vehicles in the city by the year. ""The number of vehicles registered in 2005 was 75,287. The number has risen to over 2.65 lakh vehicles in 2017. That is an increase of 252%,"" he stated.Dighe was speaking at a symposium arranged by the Association for Leadership Education Research and Training (ALERT) regarding the deteriorating air quality here on Friday. He said, ""The population increased from 1.53 lakh in 1901 to 31.24 lakh in 2011. This has also led to an increase in the number of vehicles and that is a major cause of pollution.""Adding to Dighe's observations, Amarnath Karan of Centre for Environment Education said, ""Unlike Delhi, which has thermal power plants, the much fewer industries operate on coal in Pune. /So, the major source of pollution is the residential population, most of which is due to vehicles.""Drawing a parallel with the situation in the national capital, Sujit Patwardhan of the citizen's group Parisar said, ""Vehicle pollutants are carcinogenic in nature. Practising personal vehicle oriented policies, widening roads, building flyovers and tunnels through hills and riverbeds will not improve the situation but exacerbate it.""He added, ""We should instead improve public transport and create no-vehicle zones, especially in the Peth areas. We also need to discourage private transport by improving the condition and frequency of public transport vehicles.""Explaining how pollution has an effect on local residents' health, Monica Barve of Chest Research Foundation said, ""We need a kilogram of food and three litres of water every day. However, we require 10,000 litres of oxygen each day to survive. If we are constantly exposed to pollutants, diseases are bound to happen.""She added that asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, lung cancers and accelerated ageing are some impacts pollution has on the human body.

It also contains toxic chemicals such as zinc, nickel, lead, barium, chromium and arsenic which are harmful to human health. If discarded in the open, they can poison our resources. When e-waste is heated, it releases toxins into the air in turn causing air pollution,” warn environmentalists. India is fifth in the world in e-waste generation and Ahmedabad is the sixth largest city in the country in e-waste generation. Former CEE employee and environment lover Parthesh Pandya says, “The world produces 4 crore metric tonnes of e-waste in a year. Ahmedabad procures around 400 tonnes of electronic waste. Of this, only 13 per cent is recycled. Older Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), and computer monitors contain several amounts of lead and poisonous gases. If these are not disposed of properly, it can cause severe asthma and other respiratory illnesses. The metals and chemicals found in e-waste leads to neurological diseases. “In the city of Guiyu in China which is known as the electronic wastebasket of the world, almost 80 per cent of the children have been found with higher than average le-vels of lead in their blood, which stunt the development of the brain and central nervous system.” AMC needs to quickly dispose of its waste, he advised. Deputy Municipal Commissioner (Solid Waste Management) Mukesh Gadhvi confirmed that electronic waste lay unattended in the office corridors. He told Mirror, “We have made a list of electronic items that needs to be disposed of. We had approached ECS for a quote for the disposal job and are negotiating the price. The process is on.” Mirror tried to contact Mayor Gautam Shah but he remained unavailable for comment. Meanwhile, Vijay Mandora, chairman and managing director of ECS Corporation, said, “Seven e-waste collection centres have been set up at civic centres of Danapith, Relief Road, Memco, Law Garden, Usmanpura and Bodakdev. The e-waste collection centres and app are receiving more response as awareness among people rise. We get a lot of cellphones and monitors for disposal. We are a GPCBapproved firm and recycle the parts in a scientific manner.
