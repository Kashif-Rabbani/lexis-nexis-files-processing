PM 2.5 pollution shortening lives by 3 years,"Ahmedabad: A new study has started ringing alarm bells for Gujarat cities. The uncontrolled exploitation of the air we breathe and lost green cover is reducing life expectancy in the state by between 2.9 and 3.2 years, the study 'Premature mortality in India due to PM2.5 and ozone exposure' has found. Gujarat today accounts for 4.8% of excess of premature mortalities caused by air pollution-especially particulate matter 2.5 micrometres in diameter (PM2.5) and ozone. /These particles are in high concentration along Gujarat's famed 200-km Golden Corridor, the chemical industry belt along the Western Expressway between Vapi and Ahmedabad, passing through Vadodara and Surat districts.PM2.5 from vehicular emissions, factory smoke and biomass burning as well as ozone concentration are the main concerns. The state is ranked eighth in excess deaths caused by Ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute lower respiratory illness and even lung cancer because of PM 2.5 pollution, the study claims. This study was conducted by scientists Sachin Ghude, D M Chate, C Jena, G Beig and S Fadnavis, and Prakash Pithani from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, and R Kumar, M C Barth, G G Pfister from Atmospheric Chemistry Observations and Modelling Laboratory and National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, Colorado. The research uses data compiled in the 2011 census to arrive at the figures of ""premature mortality"" due to exposure to PM 2.5 across the country. The study claims that ""Although the results are in line with other global estimates, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD), there's no physical way to tell who has actually been killed by air pollution.""The study adds ""The methods used in this study rely on statistical algorithms to construct estimates about a population's response to pollution exposure using previous concrete observations on pollution and public health./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Can HC order state to start odd-even rule?,"Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Friday wondered if the 'odd-even' system could be implemented in Mumbai. The court was hearing a clutch of petitions about worsening air pollution and its impact on emergency services due to traffic congestion in the city. ""In a city like Mumbai, is it possible to implement the odd-even system without putting in place necessary infrastructure?"" asked a division bench of Justices Vidyasagar Kanade and Mahesh Sonak. ""Can the high court order the state to implement the odd-even system?"" added the court./The lawyers for the petitioners insisted that the HC had powers to direct the state. Mumbai has a road network of around 2,000 km and as of 2015 there are over 25 lakh vehicles registered in the city. The petitioner said over 87% roads in the city are occupied by private vehicles, leaving only 13% for public transport./Bandra resident Shadaab Patel said in his PIL that traffic congestion, along with the use of diesel cars in the city, was contributing to air pollution. Another factor was lack of proper management of disposal of solid waste that is generated daily, resulting in open burning and accidental fires at civic dumping grounds, the PIL said. He referred to the fire at the Deonar dumping ground earlier in the year that led to haze and smoke in Mumbai for several days and the air quality index hovered around 250 and 300./Pedder Road resident Esha Kumar, in her application, sought orders to tackle traffic congestion in the city, that she insisted was hampering access to emergency services. She said, ""Travel speed during peak hours in the city is a crawling 10-15km per hour and many times it is almost impossible for motorists to make way for emergency services when their vehicles are struck in traffic jams.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Now, air pollution linked to strokes","Air pollution has been identified for the first time as a major contributor for stroke leading to death and disability, mainly in developing and middle-income countries like India./A new study, published in Lancet Neurology, shows air pollution is the third largest cause for stroke accounting for almost 30% of the global stroke burden./Behavioral factors, such as smoking, poor diet and lack of physical activity, are the leading cause contributing to 74.2% of stroke, followed by metabolic disorders like cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity./Experts say behavioral factors and metabolic disorders have been linked in the past as well. However, the study assumes significance because of its findings pointing at air pollution as a leading indicator for stroke./In India, more than 1.2 million people were estimated to suffer strokes every year, making it the leading cause of death and disability. Globally, about 15 million people suffer strokes every year, of which nearly 6 million die and 5 million are left disabled including loss of vision or speech, paralysis and confusion./The Lancet study is based on analysis of data from a swathe of other studies, reports and official statistics to create a mathematical model estimating stroke risk for 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. The analysis was conducted by a team of international researchers./""It is a landmark study pointing at pollution as an indicator for stroke for the first time. It is important also because there are no ideal treatment options for stroke and therefore, prevention is the best solution,"" says Dr C S Aggarwal, senior consultant, department of neurology, Ganga Ram Hospital./Findings of the study show 90.5% of the stroke burden was attributable to ""modifiable factors"" such as smoking, eating too much sugar and not exercising enough, as well as the associated health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease./Doctors say changing lifestyle and habits in developing countries is a major concern for increasing burden of non-communicable diseases./The study also listed air pollution as a ""modifiable factor"", indicating efforts by the government and people can make a difference./In lowand middle-income nations in Asia and Africa, almost a fifth of stroke burden was attributed to household air pollution, while a similar percentage was blamed on ambient air pollution in China and India./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Dust, vehicle smoke responsible for bad air","Pune: Pollution levels in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar may be among the worst, but Maharashtra is also among the states where the air quality is horrendous and responsible for people's deaths. Closer home in Pune, experts said dust, vehicular emissions and industrial emissions are mostly responsible for the poor air quality. Pune also features among Maharashtra's worst-polluted cities in a recent World Health Organization (WHO) report. The report on the air quality of urban areas compares various cities in the world. /It said Pune has 92 micrograms per cubic metre of PM10, which is almost 1.5 times higher than the national ambient air quality standard of 60 micrograms per cubic metre. Although Pune's air quality fares better, the dust on the roads and that produced by construction cannot be ignored. ""The dust particles or particulate matter 10 is high in the city and above the prescribed level,"" Pune Municipal Corporation's environment officer Mangesh Dighe said. According to Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) data, the air pollution has increased by 35.7% since 2010. ""Pune is in the top five cities when we talk of lung diseases in the country. Although awareness has increased on air pollution and its ill-effects, a lot more needs to be done,"" chest physician Nitin Abhyankar said.Shivajinagar, Hadapsar, Katraj, Lohegaon and Bhosari are polluted. Analysts say this may be due to heavy concentration of vehicles and industries in these areas. A study by the IITM in collaboration with National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Colorado, said that Maharashtra records 10% of the country's deaths due to pollution. The state's most polluted cities, as per the WHO report, include Akola, Nagpur, Chandrapur, Jalgaon, Kolhapur Nashik, Amravati, Navi Mumbai, Mumbai and Pune. While PM10 is formed mostly of dust, PM2.5 particulate matter comes mostly from vehicular emissions. Experts have noticed that although the air quality of Pune is better than Delhi and Mumbai, it is mostly 'moderate', it did have 'poor' air quality on certain days. ""Pune city sees a lot of variation in the air quality. Colder temperatures lead to a rise in the air pollution as particulate matter hangs or remains suspended in the air. Hence, in the winter months, air pollution levels are recorded higher than the other months. Also, in the other months, during festivals like Diwali and New Year, the levels rise again and go into the moderate or poor category,"" a researcher with the System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) project said. In May and June, pollution levels are relatively lower than the other months. In Pune, the average concentration of PM2.5 in May this year was recorded as 38.02 and in Mumbai as 48.49 micrograms per cubic metre.A senior scientist explained that permissible level of PM2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3). Levels above that limit is a cause for concern, even if it lies in 'moderate' or 'poor' quality levels. High PM2.5 concentrations cause respiratory diseases like asthma and bronchitis. These particles can also penetrate deep into the lungs and blood stream. Experts and doctors have expressed concern about the rising fine particulate matter. Sundeep Salvi, director of the Pune-based Chest Research Foundation, reiterates that regular exposure to such pollutants causes ischemic heart diseases. The IITM report said there were around 2.5 lakh premature mortalities in 2011 due to exposure to PM2.5 and O3./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Indoor pollution levels in city alarming, finds study","Gurgaon: A study conducted by a private hospital and an NGO has painted an alarming picture of the quality of air we breathe indoors in Gurgaon. According to it, of the 100 offices and houses surveyed, 76% were found to have unhealthy indoor air quality with PM2.5 concentration over 250 microns per cubic metre (\xB5m\xB3). The study also found 31% of the population - who spend time indoors at offices and homes - had one or the other air-borne diseases, while 47% have symptoms of respiratory diseases.According to doctors involved in the study, manufacturing offices in Udyog Vihar were the most polluted, with PM2.5 levels of over 300\xB5m\xB3. IT offices were comparatively less polluted, with PM2.5 level of about 200\xB5m\xB3.Houses in the old city are more unhealthy, with PM2.5 level between 250\xB5m\xB3 and 300\xB5m\xB3. Even houses in Sushant Lok and DLF townships have PM2.5 level over 200\xB5m\xB3. At PM2.5 level of 100\xB5m\xB3, houses with the cleanest air were found in Sector 50 and 51. As per WHO standards, PM2.5 level should not exceed 60\xB5m\xB3. Concentration of PM 2.5 below 60\xB5m\xB3 is considered good, 60-100\xB5m\xB3 satisfactory, 101-250\xB5m\xB3 polluted, 251-300\xB5m\xB3 unhealthy, and above 300\xB5m\xB3 hazardous.""With people spending most of their time indoors, indoor pollution is becoming a major cause of respiratory diseases in Gurgaon residents. /We found 32% people in places with 'unhealthy' indoor air had symptoms of respiratory diseases. The figure was 59% for people in 'hazardous' places,"" said Dr Himanshu Garg, senior pulmonologist, Artemis Hospital, one of the survey partners.He added studies by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), International Agency for Research on Cancer and WHO show indoor air quality is more dangerous than outdoor air pollution. ""Since we spend more time indoors, the risk is more. Women and children are most vulnerable,"" said Dr Garg.Doctors held bad ventilation, lack of maintenance of ACs, construction work and use of chemicals, incense sticks, etc. responsible for the menace. ""In Gurgaon, the situation is worse because of construction work. Houses and offices close to construction sites have high indoor pollution,"" said Dr Pratibha, another pulmonologist.As remedy, experts said people should monitor air quality and keep indoor plants. ""People should regularly monitor air quality at home, ensure there are 2-3 airways in each room, and check air flow of ACs. Indoor plants, such as ferns, palms, peace lilies, golden pothos, snake plant and bamboo bring down indoor air pollution,"" said Surekha Singh, a city-based architect.Vijay Kannan of survey partner NGO Clean Air India Movement, said, ""The idea was to engage, educate and encourage people to adopt air friendly measures in the interest of their own health, and take measures to bring down indoor air pollution.""The study was conducted in 90 houses and 10 offices with over 150 employees each. Spirometry and symptom scoring was used for individuals, along with pollution level checks at each location./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Plastic shredding unit closed down,"Kochi: Thrikkakara municipality has shut down its sole plastic shredding unit after residents raised concerns of air pollution in the locality. According to residents, toxic smoke spreads over the area when plastic is processed in the plant. /This creates physical uneasiness, including suffocation and cough.The unit was installed at a cost of Rs 6 lakh. Due to shut down, plastic collection in the locality has been stopped partially.The plant began its operation in 2012. In the unit, large quantity of plastic will be burned and condensed into a single piece. This recycled product will be later shredded and used as raw material in construction of roads.During initial days, the quantity of plastic processed here was comparatively less. Later, two to three tonnes of plastic were recycled here.""The unit used to function everyday from 10pm to 4am,"" said C A Nishad, health standing committee member of Thrikkakkara municipality.""It was functioning in an unscientific manner. The smoke that erupts from the plant was highly poisonous as they did not install pollution control mechanism. The municipality could not install smoke stack scrubbers to reduce pollution,'' said M S Anilkumar, president of Thrikkakara residents' association apex council (TRAAC).He said smoke that erupts from the plant was capable of creating respiratory problems, including suffocation.""Pollution has already created a real mess in our livelihood,"" he said.However, after the unit had stopped functioning, the local body authorities said that they have entrusted a team to collect plastic wastes without undergoing any treatment.""The unit will remain closed until a consensus is made with the residents,"" said Anilkumar./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Odd-even is headed Bengaluru's way,"Dust and pollution are the bane of Bengalurean commuters and pedestrians. Now, in an attempt to crack down on the fog of smog enveloping the city, a weeklong drive to test emission levels was launched on Thursday. On the first day, more than 70 per cent of cargo vehicles failed the pollution test and were heavily penalised. /As a precursor to the government's final decision on banning pollution-emitting vehicles and implement Delhi's 'odd-even' formula, the state government appointed a coordination committee comprising various agencies: Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, Central Pollution Control Board, Transport department, BBMP, BMTC and the police department. The drive has been launched at entry points into the city. A five-hour-long initiative along the busy Mysuru Road revealed that several vehicles were flouting the Bharat stage IV emission norms. The agencies will hold similar drives on Tumakuru Road, Airport Road and other major roads that connect the city with neighbouring districts, this week. According to KSPCB, all vehicle-owners have been informed about the checks and in the days to come, surprise checks will be made to catch polluting vehicles. Giving details of the first day of the drive, Lakshman, chairman, KSPCB, told Bangalore Mirror that most violations were reported by cargo vehicles that enter the city from neighbouring districts like Ramanagara, Mandya and Mysuru. ""A total of 92 vehicles were checked for emission norms. Of the 71 petrol vehicles, only four failed the test. Of the 21 diesel vehicles checked, 15 failed the emission test. All of them were cargo vehicles like luggage auto-rickshaws, tempos and mini-trucks and belonged to other districts. We have not spared even those holding valid emission certificates and measured emissions using our certified equipment,"" he said. Transport authorities have penalised owners of polluting vehicles with a Rs 2,000 fine for first offence. Interestingly, BMTC buses, which are believed to emit huge amounts of toxic gases, had a 90 per cent pass rate. ""Almost all BMTC buses cleared the test with their emissions well under control,"" Lakshman explained. Starting from Monday, ""we have decided to include government cars that are used by bureaucrats and VIPs and they will also be checked for pollution from Monday,"" Lakshman said. Sources in the Transport department said that the government had no details about the nature of vehicles that cause the maximum pollution and have assigned the joint coordination committee to conduct a study and submit a detailed report. ""The study will help us find out the extent of the emission from various categories of vehicles. Currently, it is cargo vehicles that are emitting more smoke and we will wait a few days for the results to come in from other parts of the city too. After consolidating the report, we will submit a report to the government and recommend action,"" Lakshman said. The last scientific study on the city's air quality was done back in 2009. ""There have been various sources that add to air pollution, ranging from dust to vehicular emission. In fact, vehicular emission contributes 40 to 45 per cent of the city's air pollution followed by Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) that largely comes from road-side dust. Today, with the drive, we will be able to clearly figure out what categories of vehicles are causing the most damage to Bengaluru's air,"" Lakshman said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Nearly 1.59 million premature deaths per year in India linked to air pollution: IEA,"New Delhi: An estimated 6.5 million premature deaths in the world are linked to air pollution every year with more than half of them being reported from China and India together. India alone contributes 1.59 million deaths to this dubious figure. The global number will increase significantly, touching 7.5 million in 2040, unless the energy sector that emits majority of air pollutants takes greater action to curb emission, says the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its special report, released on Monday.The report, highlighting links between energy, air pollution and health, says no country is immune as a staggering 80% of cities that monitor pollution levels fail to meet the air quality standards set by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Though it notes that the number of deaths due to household air pollution (use of biomass for cooking and kerosene for lighting) at present is more than the deaths due to outdoor air pollution, the trend will reverse in 2040 as more and more people would be able to access the relatively cleaner cooking gas and electricity by then.In a chapter on India - a home to 11 of the world's 20 most polluted cities, the report highlights the recent measures taken by the country to curb its emission, particularly in power sector. /But, it notes, these achievements are more often offset by strong growth in emissions from industry and transportation sector, emphasising that the air quality will remain an important policy concerns even in 2040.The IEA, an autonomous organisation, works to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy to its 29 member countries. It was set up in 1974 to help these rich nations coordinate a collective response to major disruptions in the supply of oil.Noting that the air pollution is the fourth largest human health risk after high blood pressure, poor diets and smoking, the IEA's World Energy Outlook (WEO) special report says the energy production and use - mostly from unregulated, poorly regulated or inefficient fuel combustion - are the most important man-made sources of key air pollutant emission - 85% of particulate matter and almost all of the sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides.""Clean air is a basic human right that most of the world's population lacks"", said IEA executive director Fatih Birol, noting that the proven energy policies and technologies can deliver major cuts in air pollution around the world and bring health benefits, provide broader access to energy and improve sustainability.Referring to India's Capital, the report says that the the two coal-fired power plants (Badarpur and Rajghat) are the main sources of PM2.5 emissions in Delhi. ""Without action to tackle these emissions, among others, PM emissions in Delhi are expected to increase by 25% over the next 15 years under current legislation. Emissions could fall by 35% over the next 15 years, if effective measures to reduce emissions from the power sector and traditional open cooking were taken and proved successful,"" it says.Pollution deaths in India:Present (2015 figures): Total premature deaths due to air pollution - 1.59 millionDue to household air pollution - 1 millionDue to outdoor air pollution - 590000Projection (2040):Total premature deaths due to air pollution - 1.7 millionDue to household air pollution - 800000Due to outdoor air pollution - 900000/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Timely action could bring PM emissions down 35%,"NEW DELHI: The International Energy Agency (IEA) has said that Delhi's particle pollution could fall by 35% over the next 15 years if it manages to reduce emissions from the power sector, vehicles and biomass burning, including cooking with solid fuels in slums./IEA's World Energy Outlook 2016 report, which was released on Monday, has referred to an ongoing study commissioned by the ministry of environment to the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)./If these actions are not taken, Delhi's PM emissions will increase by 25% by 2030. ""Traditional use of biomass for cooking and two coal-fired plants (Badarpur and Rajghat) are the two main sources of PM 2.5 emissions in Delhi,"" the report states. Rajghat is likely to be shut down soon./The Delhi government plans to convert it to a waste-to-energy plant. Scientists at NEERI who are working on the city's pollution problem said modelling studies were being done at IIASA to observe how various scenarios would impact Delhi's air quality between 2020 and 2030. The study will be published in about four months and could provide a road map for air pollution action in the capital, the scientists said./""PM levels will come down if the government introduces BS VI norm by 2020. The power plants should convert to gas in the next couple of years and biomass burning for cooking or otherwise should stop to achieve a 35% improvement in PM levels by 2030,"" a NEERI scientist said. ""Solid fuels are still being used for cooking in the slums. People should convert to LPG. The final road map will be available once our report is ready.""/This is the first time that Paris-based IEA, an autonomous organisation which works to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its 29 member countries and beyond, has released a World Energy Outlook report on air pollution. It has flagged that around 6.5 million deaths globally are attributed to poor air quality making it the world's fourth largest threat to health after high blood pressure, dietary risks and smoking./The report has some interesting observations on how India and China are tackling air pollution. It states that while emission levels have started to decline in China, there is ""modest growth"" in India. ""In China, a strong policy focus on air quality bears fruit and the recent dip in pollutant emissions becomes a long-term trend: emissions of particulate matter are 40% lower by 2040 as energy consumption growth slows, the energy mix diversifies away from coal and strict pollution controls are enforced.../""In India, the pollution outlook worsens to 2040 as energy demand rises by 150% although tighter standards in the power and transport sectors, the replacement of traditional cooking fuels with LPG and ambitious targets for wind and solar, all help to limit the growth in pollutant emissions to around 10%,"" the report says./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

'Breathing toxic air is akin to passive smoking',"AHMEDABAD: Polluted air can be as dangerous as passive smoking warned medical experts at a public seminar held on Sunday at Ahmedabad Management Association (AMA). Air heavy with particulate matter - PM10 and PM2.5 - can increase chances of heartstroke. Polluted water, contaminating fruits and vegetables, is already causing a number of gastric problems. These were some of the observations made by the experts on hazards of polluted environment.HCG Hospitals had organized the seminar on 'Effect of Pollution on Human Health' at AMA where speakers included Dr Bhupesh Shah, Dr Hansal Bhachech, Dr Kaustubh Patel, Dr Parthiv Mehta, Dr Sunil Mehta and Dr Urman Dhruv. /The organizers said that their primary concern was the ever-increasing toxicity in air, soil and water that has already increased inflow of patients in the city. The speakers said that the only safeguard is better lifestyle and habits, and understanding that it was everyone's responsibility to save the environment.Speaking about pollution and cancer, Dr Kaustubh Patel, city-based oncologist, said that around 20% lung cancer patients the world over are non-smokers, and experts believe that rising pollution levels have a role to play. ""International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has already identified air pollutants including benzene, asbestos, radon and formaldehyde as carcinogenic, whereas it puts diesel engine exhaust, tricholrothlene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in the list of probables,"" said Patel.Dr Urman Dhruv, a consulting physician and diabetologist, said that exposure to air pollution puts in danger all who are already susceptible to stroke and have irregular heart rhythms. ""There is evidence for short-term associations between PM10 and hospital admissions for ischemic strokes,"" he said.The speakers elaborated that while Ahmedabad has not yet become as bad as Delhi, where smog is a common phenomenon, the time to change is now if we wanted to ensure better future for the next generations. Dr Bhupesh Shah, in his talk on pollution's adverse impact on the human heart, said that the city air already features high in PM10 and PM2.5 pollution.""Exposure to pollution causes issues including vascular spasm, chest inflammation and hypertensive nephropathy to a person,"" said Shah./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"By 2030, climate shift may kill 250k more per year","NEW DELHI: Climate change is likely to kill 250,000 more people each year by 2030, latest assessment by the World Health Organisation (WHO) shows. Most of these deaths will be caused from malaria, diarrhoeal disease, heat stress and malnutrition.India, which already has a high burden of these diseases, is expected to contribute significantly to the global death toll. A separate study conducted by the University of Oxford, published in the international medical journal Lancet earlier this year, projected 130,000 deaths in the country fromin 2050.The heaviest burden of diseases due to climate change will fall on children, women, elderly and the poor, further widening health inequalities between and within populations, WHO said. /It asked countries, including India, to spend more to protect itself from health risks linked to climate, such as extreme weather events and outbreaks of infectious diseases.The UN agency had set up an agenda and proposed key actions for its implementation during its recent Paris meet. WHO estimates that climate change is already causing tens of thousands of deaths every year.These deaths arise from more frequent epidemics like cholera, as well as the vast geographical distribution of diseases like dengue and from extreme weather events, like heat waves and floods.At the same time, nearly seven million people die each year from diseases caused by air pollution, such as lung cancer and stroke. More than half of these air pollution related deaths are being reported from China and India, with the latter's contribution to this dismal statistic being 1.59 million.Climatic conditions intensely affect diseases transmitted through water and insects. According to WHO's assessment, in the next 15 years, heat exposure will cause around 38,000 deaths. Deaths due to diarrhoea are projected to reach 48,000, as many as 60,000 due to malaria and 95,000 owing to childhood malnutrition.Highlighting the benefits of switching to cleaner energy sources, WHO said it will reduce air pollutants, besides providing desperately needed power for health facilities. ""The health sector should themselves make a greater effort to promote low-carbon healthcare facilities and technologies; these can simultaneously improve service delivery and reduce costs as well as climate and environmental impacts,"" it said.WHO has called for adoption of a new approach to link health economics assessment and climate change. For instance, by calculating the healthcare costs avoided when countries invest in mitigation of climate emissions. It has also announced a new working group which will articulate a coherent approach to health economics and climate change./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Metro work on, jams a norm on Charbagh road","Lucknow: Traffic congestion prevailing all day on the 100-metre stretch around Lucknow Metro construction work site near Charbagh railway station has disturbed Dr Faisal Ali's schedule. A resident of Lalbagh, Ali has to cross the area four times a day to reach his clinic in Alambagh for the morning and evening shifts./""I spend two to three hours caught in a jam every day as it takes 30-45 minutes to cross the area each time. It has disturbed my entire work schedule,"" said Ali, narrating his daily ordeal. Like Ali, traffic congestion outside the railway station entrance has become a challenge for thousands plying on the road. The worst hit are emergency cases or those who have to board a train or catch a flight./Charbagh witnesses heavy traffic because of railway and bus stations. Metro construction work has reduced the width of the road. The problem has been aggravated after the intercity roadways bus routes were changed. Buses from Vidhan Sabha Marg have to take U-turn from the intersection near Ravindralaya. Many buses stop at the U-turn to pick up passengers. Autos compound the problem by parking around buses./""A bus takes a turn in 10-15 minutes, resulting in a jam. By the time the jam is cleared, another bus comes and turns. As a result, congestion has become order of the day,"" said Sashi Prakash, a resident of Charbagh. Besides traffic jam, noise and air pollution too has registered an increase in the area, he added./People complained bitterly about lack of personnel to manage traffic, which, they say, along with diversion can solve the problem to some extent. Lucknow Metro had announced it will deploy traffic marshals to man roads but there are none to be seen, said Rakhi Singh, a commuter./""Police should deploy more personnel to manage traffic. Constables are rarely seen,"" she added./The trisection was chock-a-block with two and four wheelers. Rajiv Gupta was stuck in traffic jam for 45 minutes while his family which had arrived by Lucknow Mail kept waiting for him to receive him. ""Lucknow metro should appoint traffic marshals here as they did during construction at Alambagh,"" said visibly agitated Rajiv Gupta, who works in a private firm./Scene 2: 2pm/Several trains have arrived at the northern and northeastern railway stations. The number of vehicles increases. While some have to reach home from station, others are rushing to catch a train. The situation turns from bad to worse. ""I will miss my train, if I don't reach the station in five minutes,"" said a panic-struck Rajesh, who decides to leave behind his vehicle and walk all the way to the station along with the luggage. ""More traffic constables should be deployed here to manage things,"" said Samir, a bank employee, struggling through the traffic./Scene 3: 6pm/Arvind Makhija missed his train to Delhi because of the huge traffic jam at the trisection with the increase in inflow of vehicles after office hours. ""I came to board the Dibrugarh-Rajdhani Express but missed the train. I had to attend a meeting in Delhi but now I will have to think of some other way,"" said Makhija, a government officer./Scene 4: 10pm/Even in the night, there is no relief from traffic jam. Raji, who works in Air Asia, was caught in the congestion for over 40 minutes and missed the flight. ""Now I will have to forego my off day otherwise my salary will be deducted. It will also spoil my record,"" he said. Asthma patient Ashima Shourey said vehicular smoke during jam aggravates her condition./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Polluted Patna: City chokes on filthy air,"Patna: In the wake of a survey conducted by the World Health Organization in May last year, in which Patna ranked second after Delhi in the list of the most polluted cities, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has finally agreed to implement a rule prohibiting diesel vehicles that have been operational for 15 years or more from plying the roads of the city. Kumar also said the government was planning to restrict burning of plastic and solid waste. Despite these initiatives, air pollution in the city is increasing at an alarming rate. /Even though Patna does not have any heavy industry, its level of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) is very high. According to the Indira Gandhi Planetarium, the SPM level in the city in April this year was as high as 355 micro-grams per cubic metre, far more than the permissible limit of 100 micro-grams per cubic metre. Arvind Mallik, an expert in science, said, ""Vehicles emit oxides of nitrogen and sulphur, besides un-burnt particles of carbon that we see as the cloud of black smoke coming from the exhaust of cars."" These gases and particulates have serious effects on the human body and cause a range of problems like irritation in the eyes to acute cases of asthma.Students and office-goers, who travel across the city, bear the brunt of air pollution. Harsh Vardhan, a student living in Kankarbagh, said, ""I became a victim of sinus (paranasal sinus) when I was 14. The doctors said the root cause of this disease is pollution."" RK Das, a resident of Pataliputra, said, ""I take my vehicle once every month for pollution check. Punitive measures should be taken against those don't.""The process of pollution check involves inserting a nozzle into the vehicle's exhaust and checking the composition of the emitted gas. The whole process costs a paltry sum of Rs 50 in service centres across the city.A graduate from Patna Women's College, Priyanka Priyadarshini, said, ""I am compelled to use scarves or a mask and sunglasses while travelling in the city as the air mixed with dust and harmful gases causes irritation, headache and nausea if these precautions are not taken."" Ajay Patel, president of an auto union, said, ""The auto drivers usually don't take their vehicle for pollution check and the maintenance is done only when the vehicle stops functioning. Even the government is blind to issue of pollution control.""Sexagenarian Indu Devi, who is an asthma patient, said, ""When I lived in the village (Chakia in Motihari district), the ailment was under control. Ever since I moved to Patna for better treatment, the condition is getting worse. I have a problem breathing whenever I go to a place where vehicular traffic is high."" Shailaja Singh, who works in the Reserve Bank of India in Mumbai, said, ""The city (Patna) should also opt for CNG like Delhi. It is eco-friendly, cheap, and convenient to use.""

Made in Chennai stoves warm up lives in Himalayas,"Chennai: At the crack of dawn, 14-year-old Dsudee begins an arduous journey to collect firewood. Shivering under her monkey cap and sweater, the Class 9 resident of Khalsa village in Uttarakhand struggles through rocky terrain and uneven paths. She repeats this trip thrice a day, walking nearly 18km in total. /Once home, she helps her grandmother make a tall stack of rotis for the family, coughing and battling tears due to the clouds of smoke from the chulha or mud stove. But her difficult lifestyle is slowly changing for the better after 'clean stoves' were distributed to houses in her village as part of the Himalayan Clean Cooking Project (HCCP).Launched by the Chennai Hub of the Global Shapers Community and the Himalayan Environment Trust in 2014, the project seeks to supply clean cooking stoves to remote mountain communities. These stoves combust the same fuels - wood and biomass - more efficiently. ""We got the idea when we were stuck in a hailstorm during a trek in Himachal Pradesh. We took shelter in a hut but the smoke was suffocating,"" says Varun Gunaseelan, project director.In an article on the World Health Organisation (WHO) site dated March 2014, an estimated 700 million people in India still rely on solid fuels and traditional cook stoves for domestic cooking. It further states that having an open fire in the kitchen equivalent to burning 400 cigarettes an hour. Women and young children are considered the first victims of smoke-related acute and chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. ""According to WHO estimates, in 2012 there were close to 1.7 million premature deaths attributed to household air pollution from cooking in the Southeast Asia region with India shouldering the biggest burden,"" it says.After extensive research and surveys, the HCCP team distributed their first batch of single-burner stoves to all the 55 households in Sidri village in Uttarakhand, last year. ""We conducted road shows and live demonstrations by boiling water. On seeing that the water heated much faster, many locals placed orders,"" says Varun, adding that the stoves were provided at a discounted price of 1,000.The village headman, Ram Singh Pawar, said that households continued to use the appliance as it produced 'less smoke, cooked food faster and used lesser wood.'For the next phase of the project, the team partnered with Puducherry-based social enterprise, Prakti, to provide double-burner stoves suited for Himalayan families. The stoves accommodate wood, cow dung and agricultural wastes without processing while the steel combustion chambers ensure the fuels combust more completely. ""The stoves produce 80% to 95% less smoke compared to traditional mud stoves and three-stone fires. It also uses 40% to 80% less fuel and reduces deforestation,"" says Prakti program officer Mimi Liu, adding that cooking time is brought down by about 70%.Limited access to healthcare facilities in these remote areas makes fuel-efficient stoves the need of the hour. ""Using these stoves is crucial as early exposure to large amounts of smoke and pollutants could lead to asthma, wheezing or bronchitis in children below five years and prolonged exposure can cause lung cancer,"" says Dr Samantha Balaji, who is pursuing her masters in paediatrics.The team now conducts periodic roadshows and awareness programmes through student volunteers for various mountain communities on clean cooking methods./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Unfit vehicles continue to poison air,"KOLHAPUR: Unfit and out-dated vehicles are adding much to the city's pollution, but not much crackdown by the Regional Transport Office (RTO) is visible.RTO officials claim that few owners approach to renew the authorisation of such vehicles even after the stipulated period of their use expires. The number of unfit and unauthorised vehicles, mostly auto-rickshaws and vehicles used for passenger transport, is increasing owing to the failure of the public transport. The RTO says it does not have adequate manpower to act against the unfit vehicles and those plying without renewing registrations. /The RTO has no data for the action taken on the unfit vehicles in the city. In July, it found 421 cases of vehicles emitting harmful gases. The civic body has allowed these vehicles to ply by merely imposing fines between Rs 100 and Rs 1,000. The RTO has collected fines of around Rs 58,800 in July.Assistant regional transport officer Ramchandra Kharade said, ""At present, there are three active squads for the entire district to check vehicular emissions. Also, we don't have the facility to scrutinize the pollution under control certificate (PUC) provided by several centres. We are trying to make the vehicle operators aware about pollution. Besides, we have simplified the processes to get the registration renewed and the tests done. This will help the vehicle owners apply in large number for renewal.""As per the rules, the private vehicles should not ply once they complete 15 years. Some vehicles get additional period on the basis of the fitness level. At the time of renewing the registrations, the operator has to undertake several tests, produce all documents and upgrade the machines in the vehicles to ensure low air pollution. According to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration should not exceed 150 microgram per cubic metre. On the other hand, the respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) should not exceed 80 microgram per cubic metre. The data accessed from various air monitoring centres in the city such as Dabholkar Corner and Mahadwar Road shows that the SPM has been reached up to 390 micro gram/cubic meter and RSPM to 120 micro gram/cubic meter. The environmentalists claim that increasing number of unfit vehicles are more dangerous that those newly added as the later ones at least have advanced system to emit less harmful smoke. The trend of the operators to mix kerosene in petrol to make more profit out of less fuel price has made air more polluted. Uday Gaikwad, a city-based environmental expert, said, ""Vehicles that are unfit or have passed the certain number of years should be discarded. We don't remember a single drive by RTO against polluting vehicles in the near past. The RTO should make the drive schedule public each time it decides to take action.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Swargadwar chimney defunct, pollution rises","Bhubaneswar: The electric chimney installed at Swargadwar in Puri has become defunct, increasing pollution at the sought-after crematorium. The Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB), which had installed the chimney two years ago, found it defunct recently and asked the Puri municipality to make it operational. But, the municipality is sitting over it.Located along the sea beach, Swargadwar witnesses cremation of at least 40 bodies every day. /Around seven bodies can be cremated below the platform where the chimney has been installed.Taking note of the air pollution beyond the permissible limit, the pollution board built the chimney and handed it over to the civic body. ""We have been receiving complaints that is not being maintained properly. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had taken serious view of the pollution caused by the crematorium and asked us to install the chimney,"" said OSPCB regional officer (Bhubaneswar-Puri) Hadibandhu Panigrahi. The chimney has the capacity to absorb 12,000 microgram of dust and smog every hour. ""Without the chimney, we have recorded emission of particulate matter of 727 microgram per metre cube from the cremation ground as against the permissible limit of 100. If remain unchecked, the ambient air will become highly polluted. This can lead to pulmonary diseases,"" said an officer of the pollution panel.The OSPCB said that the municipality is yet to take steps to install 20 such chimneys and prevent cremation of bodies in open space. ""After the NGT asked the Puri municipality to comply pollution control norms, the latter gave it in writing, promising to set up 20 more chimneys,"" said Panigrahi.In February, Puri collector Aravind Agrawal slapped a showcause notice on the civic body for an alleged violation pertaining to use of the land meant for the expansion of Swargadwar. The municipality has constructed stalls on the 100 decimal land that was given to the municipality for expansion of Swargadwar for creation of 20 more platforms for cremation. Swargadwar was set up in 1985 with the government allotting 900 decimal. In 1988, another hundred decimal was acquired for expansion of the crematorium./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution speeds up death of lung cancer patients,"NEW DELHI: A big, population based study of lung cancer patients in California has shown that their survival is linked to the amount of air pollutants they are exposed to. Those living in areas with high levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (both PM10 and PM2.5) live less after acquiring lung cancer. And, this is all the more true for those in early stages of the deadly disease.The researchers tracked the health outcomes up until the end of 2011 of more than 352,000 people newly diagnosed with lung cancer between 1988 and 2009, and whose details had been entered into the US California Cancer Registry. /Using data from US Environmental Protection Agency air quality monitoring stations, study participants' exposure to air pollutants was mapped to their residences. The study is published in the journal Thorax.Lung cancer is of several types and depending on when it is diagnosed, survival rates are different. For patients with early stage disease, average survival time was shortest for those with small and large cell cancers (around 1.5 years) and longest for those with adenocarcinoma (around 5 years).Almost half of the study participants (45.4%) lived more than 1500 metres away from a major interstate motorway. Less than 10% lived within a 300 metre radius of one.After taking account of these, and other potentially influential factors, the calculations showed that higher exposures to each of the four pollutants were associated with a correspondingly heightened risk of death and shorter average and 5-year survivals.But the magnitude of heightened risk was greatest for patients with early stage disease, among whom average survival was 2.4 years for those with high PM2.5 exposure (at least 16 ug/m3) and 5.7 years for those with low exposure (less than 10 ug/m3), for example.Overall, for patients with early stage disease, risk of death from any cause was 30% greater for NO2; 26% greater for PM10; and 38% greater for PM2.5. The impact of exposure to O3 was small (4%).These trends were particularly evident among patients with early stage adenocarcinoma.As might be expected, survival for patients with advanced disease was poor, irrespective of exposure to pollutants.This is an observational study so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. And the researchers point to several caveats, including a lack of data on potentially important risk factors, such as an individual's lifestyle, smoking status, and alcohol intake; and the inability to capture road traffic pollution.The most recent figures from the World Health Organization estimate that 1.8 million new cases of cancer were diagnosed in 2012 alone./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
MPCB finds fault in waste dumping,"Aurangabad: The municipal corporation may land in trouble for the alleged unscientific disposal of solid waste at the Naregaon dumping yard.Dhananjay Patil, regional officer of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), submitted his affidavit-in-reply to the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday stating that the municipal commissioner has not obtained necessary authorisation from the board and also not provided any facility for Municipal Solid Waste Management (and handling) Rules, 2000.He submitted the affidavit-in-reply following a PIL filed by N L Jadhav and other lawyers.Jadhav, appearing party-in-person, had approached the court seeking directions to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to shift its garbage dumping yard from Naregaon. He said the yard has been causing health problems to those living in a radius of 10km. Besides, the thick smoke emanating from the dumping yard has also become a major problem for flight operation from Aurangabad airport, he said.The petition came up for hearing before justices R M Borde and K L Wadane. Lawyer Rajendra Deshmukh representing the municipal corporation told the court that the civic body has already approached the district collector seeking an alternate place for dumping garbage. /Thereafter, the court placed the placed the hearing on the PIL on August 18.The petitioner said the municipal corporation was illegally burning garbage at Naregaon because of which huge smoke emanating was causing air pollution. Jadhav said he and other petitioners reside within 10km radius of the garbage dumbing yard and have been facing health problems.He said the petitioners have made several representation to the civic body to shift the garbage yard and also urged it to stop burning of garbage. However, the civic body failed to attend to the problem. The petitioner had made the state government, the municipal commissioner, the district collector, the divisional commissioner and the regional officer of MPCB in Aurangabad respondents in the case. Following the petition, the court had issued notices to the respondents.In his affidavit-in-reply, Patil stated, ""The municipal corporation is under obligation to take steps for the management of solid waste generated in the city. It shall manage and handle it in accordance with the compliance criteria and the procedure laid in Scheduled II of the Municipal Solid Waste Management and Handling Rules, 2000. It is obligatory on every municipal corporation to carry out waste processing and disposal on their own or through an operator.""He said the AMC was generating 400 metric tonnes of solid waste in the city. The affidavit stated, ""Presently, respondent no. 2 (municipal commissioner) is dumping the collected solid waste unscientifically at Naregon. The municipal commissioner has not obtained necessary authorisation from the MPCB and also not provided any facility for municipal solid wastes management under the rules. Non-seggregated mixed municipal solid waste with bio-degradable and non-biodegradable waste is being dumped in an unscientific manner.""""Burning of waste has been observed at a few places and no responsible person was available at the site during the inspection carried out by MPCB on at least four occasions. No facility for processing was provided at the site thereby causing serious pollution in the surrounding area. The result of ambient air quality monitoring carried out at Naregaon on December 17, 2014, and January 29, 2015, exceeded the prescribed standard creating air pollution,"" Patil said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pollution check: Online system at heavy industries,"RAIPUR: Aiming at conservation of environment, heavy industries of power, aluminium, steel and 17 other industries in and around the state capital have been equipped with online pollution monitoring systems in last six months to monitor pollution readings. Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board (CECB)'s chief engineer RP Tiwari said, ""Online monitoring equipment have been installed in 45 industries in and around Raipur. As many as 137 industrial units across Chhattisgarh have now got such online monitoring facility as per the pollution control guidelines issued by the Central Board."" /Majority of industries in Raipur are steel, power and other seventeen types of heavy polluting industries, which emit smoke and add to air pollution. Tiwari said that the online device is connected with chimney's emission system hence indicates the emission of various gases in the environment. A common server for online pollution monitoring system is yet to be developed and would take another few months and this would assimilate the reading of emission of gases and pollution of the entire industries equipped with online pollution-check device. Now, the data of emission of gases are collected manually and a control room is yet to be launched to streamline the monitoring of all devices installed in industries across Chhattisgarh. This would immediately send the alert, warning and notice to the industrialists to check causes of emission of pollutants.This online device cannot manipulate the pollution level readings, hence, would create constant pressure on industrialists. Mansoor Ali, general manager of private power industry, said, ""This system alerts us to keep a tab and control emission of pollutants. It has also instilled a sense of environmental conservation the environment besides generating business out of industry.""CECB member secretary Devendra Singh appealed industrialists to plant 1,000 saplings in a recently convened meeting. The department also took the decision to launch a helpline number to lodge complaints regarding violation of noise and air pollution standards./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
HORN JUST NOT OK PLEASE,"Low traffic awareness and lack of basic civic sense seem to force the hand of otherwise sane motorists when it comes to honking. They say that there are too many motorists who cut lanes without warning, or ride in the middle of the road slowly or stop abruptly./Something similar happened to fashion designer and adventure biker Anukaran Singh. ""Honking is a necessity. When friends on multiple two-wheelers ride parallel to each other without consideration of those behind them, there is no choice but to honk to make way,"" he said./Vikram Naidu, an entrepreneur, said badly designed roads were just as much at fault. ""Take, for instance, WHC Road. So many lanes open up on it, so someone on the main road has to be on the lookout for another motorist emerging abruptly from one of these lanes,"" he said, contrasting this situation with that of Chandigarh where the main roads and lanes are separated by service roads./Anaadi Shivnani, project director of a start-up called Dream Catchers, said that excessive honking is more of a psychological issue that has its roots in the stressed lives we lead. ""Honking while driving has pretty much become a habit for many people,"" he observed./Taking a dig at those who argue that honking is a necessity, ENT specialist Dr Madan Kapre said, ""Well, so is food and water. But anything done in excess is bad.""/Many panellists advocated bringing awareness among youngsters about the evils of too much honking. Zeenat Syed, principal of Podar International School at Besa, says it should start at the school level. ""We had a project called 'Green and Go' to teach children about the importance of following traffic lights. Something similar on honking would be a good idea,"" she said./Anjali Gaidhane, head of the department of political science at Hislop College, said that it might be all right to honk while driving on the highway and overtaking someone. Some panellists, including Dr Kapre, countered this, saying that nowadays, most highways are four-lane and there is no need to honk on them./Activist Shyamala Sanyal said that it is most irritating when people honk at red lights. She said police action is what is needed to curb this annoying habit. Dr Anil Laddhad, president of NGO Janakrosh that deals with traffic awareness, said that citizens should go honking-free for two hours each day. ""People will then realize the peace that comes with it and start doing so on their own,"" he said./Business analyst Rashmi Singh said that refraining from honking is something she already practises and has realized that it is not necessary. ""We will stop honking at the drop of a hat the day we stop looking at others as obstacles,"" she added./Gaidhane observed that unlike water or air pollution, which become apparent due to dirty water bodies and plumes of smoke, noise pollution is invisible and, therefore, does not get the attention it deserves. She added that in the West, each driver, before he or she gets a driver's licence, gets a lot of training, which sensitizes them about traffic etiquette./On the other hand, Dr Kapre added, in India, the attitude is that if one breaks the rules, one is smart. ""You see these parents and grandparents jumping the red light even when they have children travelling with them. Naturally, the kid will think, 'Wow, grandpa is so smart breaking the rules' and do the same,"" he said. This, he said, creeps in when it comes to honking as well./Gaidhane said that loud horns may get the driver attention and give him or her a false sense of power. Syed recalled a personal example, saying that when she was on a holiday to Kerala, she did not hear any loud honking despite the narrow streets there. ""It was just a great sign of maturity of the drivers there,"" she said./Loud honking is not just an irritant, it is also a proven health hazard. Dr Kapre explained: ""The sound can startle you and this could make you lose control over your vehicle, which can then lead to accidents. A woman and her daughter died precisely like this near Narendra Nagar when they fell down from their two-wheeler after a heavy vehicle behind them honked loudly, throwing the ill-fated duo on to the road.""/There are many other ways in which loud and persistent honking sound in traffic affects all of us. Prolonged exposure to such sound can make one agitated. ""Many people complain that they arrive at their workplace frazzled and stressed due to traffic noise,"" Dr Kapre said. Very loud horns can also cause what is known as sudden acoustic trauma, he added./He added how a local study revealed that students studying in a quieter neighbourhood tended to have better concentration than those with a lot of noise./Again, the panellists agreed that lax administration was to blame for not taking efforts to make people aware of sound levels. Naidu claimed that he kept seeing fewer and fewer no-honking signboards across the city. He added that the situation across the country had become so bad that even luxury car makers were fitting horns with a much louder sound for models to be sold in India, just because of the high traffic noise./Anaadi Shivnani added that in a place like Delhi, there were just 15 noise meters for 86 lakh vehicles. Even in Bhubaneswar, which is India's first Smart City, there were just over 200 traffic policemen for the 10-lakh vehicular population, he added./Police inspector Shyam Sontakke, who joined the discussion late due to official engagements, said that honking was, indeed, low on the priority list of traffic police, who focus on much graver offences such as riding without helmets, jumping the red signal and dangerous driving. He added that the police did take strong action when honking becomes especially severe, such as occasions like Independence Day. ""But I can't understand why the public is just not becoming aware of the issue,"" he said./Towards the end of the discussion, the panellists also spoke about the role of activists in the scenario. Gaidhane said that some activists were indeed making a difference. Rashmi Singh, too, recalled a poster that said, ""Even dogs bark for a reason.""/Dr Laddhad pretty much summed it up when he said, ""To our other fundamental rights, we should add another.

36% diesel vehicles exceed national limit for emissions: Study,"BENGALURU: Smoke-spewing vehicles are largely to blame for the toxic air we breathe. A study has found that 36.3% of the diesel vehicles in the city and 12.6% run on petrol exceed the national limit for vehicular emissions. Diesel and petrol vehicles which are over 15 years old emit more pollutants. /The study titled 'joint monitoring of vehicular emissions in Bangalore city' was conducted in the months of June and July to assess the impact of vehicular emissions on the ambient air quality. It was conducted by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) along with the transport and road safety department, traffic police, BMTC and the zonal office of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). A total of 1,978 vehicles were screened, of which 1,279 were petrol vehicles and 524 diesel. While 1,118 petrol vehicles (87.5%) were within the national limit, 161 vehicles (12.6%) overshot it. Among the diesel vehicles, 334 (63.7%) were within the national limit and 190 (36.3%) were found to have exceeded it. As per the annual average data of air pollutants monitored by KSPCB, particulate matter values have exceeded the national limit of 60 micrograms per metre cube at all its 12 monitoring locations in Bengaluru in the range of 20%-215%.Why automobiles cause air pollution *Rampant increase in population (95,88,910) and number of vehicles. 67,64,111 vehicles were registered in city as on March 31, 2016*Absence of effective, efficient and well-networked transport system*Bad road conditions - potholes and road cutting*Fuel adulteration*15-year-old vehicles and two-stroke two anf three-wheelers plying on roadsSource: Joint study/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
SC dictat: ADA all set to reduce pollution near Taj,"AGRA: Following the Supreme Court's direction to reduce pollution near Taj Mahal, the Agra authorities have finalized a plan to promote electric crematorium, besides installing a 'green' system to reduce discharge of carbon particles while burning of body through traditional method at Moksha Dham, located adjacent to Taj Mahal.A sum of Rs 9.5 crore will be spent in the entire exercise by the Agra Development Authority (ADA). Talking to TOI, ADA secretary Rajesh Kumar Srivastav said, ""At Tajganj electric crematorium two additional furnaces will be installed at a cost of Rs 3.5 crore. Beautification and landscaping of the area will also be done.At Moksha Dham, which is located at just few hundred meters, the wet scrubber technique would be employed to reduce carbon pollution. It is one of the most effective techniques to reduce pollution level. /Under the wet scrubber system, smoke from pyres will be passed through a water channel which in turn will reduce emission of carbon particles, supposedly one of the main causes for turning the 17th century white marble monument yellow. A sum of Rs 5.8 crore would be spent, he added.The official informed that the department plan to complete both the works by the end of this year. The services at the electric crematorium would be provided free of cost to people.In April, 2016, the Supreme Court had directed to the Agra Development Authority to submit its final report on the action plan to reduce air pollution due to burning of bodies at Moksh Dham (crematorium) near the Taj Mahal. SC judge Kurian Joseph, during a personal visit to Agra, had noticed the burning pyres at the ghat. In a letter dated October 1, 2015 to Chief Justice HL Dattu, he had sought the intervention of the SC, pointing to the threat to the Taj from the continuous burning of pyres.On November 16, 2015, a bench of justices TS Thakur and C Nagappan had given three weeks' time to the Central Environment Committee (CEC) to suggest an alternate space for the crematorium near Taj Mahal. At least 25 pyres are burnt here each day, and the ashes rising from these have been damaging the Taj, studies have found.Later in December, the court deferred the shifting of the cremation ground and asked the authorities to look into ways of reducing carbon emission from burning of pyres as well as beautifying the place./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pollution slur on polymer factory,"DIBRUGARH: Accusing the Brahmaputra Cracker and Polymer Limited (BCPL) of violating effluent standards and polluting surrounding rivers and water bodies, Asom Gana Parishad (Anchalikatabadi Mancha) has sought an independent probe by an expert panel.The party in a press conference on Tuesday said the BCPL plant situated at Lepetkata in Dibrugarh has been violating norms by discharging industrial wastes directly into nearby rivers without meeting the required specifications of the Pollution Control Board.""The effluent from the BCPL petrochemical plant is being discharged directly into nearby rivers and water bodies through underground pipes without being treated. The contamination of water by toxic wastes has led to a spate of fish deaths in the Sessa, Brahmaputra and Burhidehing rivers. /Even fishes caught in these rivers have become unfit for human consumption. The livelihood of local fishermen is now at stake,"" said party president Sunil Rajkonwar.Expressing concern over the issue, Rajkonwar said the phenomenon has been evident for the past five months after the BCPL, also known as the Assam Gas Cracker Project, was commissioned. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had dedicated the flagship project to the nation on April 5.""We want an independent inquiry into the matter by an expert committee. The bio-diversity of the whole area is at stake. The plant is also causing massive air pollution. People of nearby villages are suffering from skin and respiratory diseases.

2.0 shoot upsets local residents,"The shoot of Superstar Rajinikanth's upcoming film, 2.0, is going on at a brisk pace. However, we hear that the local residents are not happy with the film's unit as a massive car blast sequence, which was recently shot in Saligramam, created an ear-shattering high-decibel sound for them. It's said that the blast was shot in a very realistic manner and even the film's unit couldn't handle the noise and air pollution created because of it. A source close to the unit says, ""Neither Rajini or Akshay Kumar were present at the spot. Only Shankar and cinematographer Nirav Shah, along with stunt men, were shooting in Saligramam for almost a week. The scene had real explosives kept inside a container tank. Then, a luxury car was made to collide from the top. The blast was real and the entire place was enveloped in smoke. Local residents were upset with the noise and pollution it created."" But the source adds that the team was happy with the shot. ""Shankar sir was happy with the way the scene was shot and hugged Nirav Shah. Many military tankers were also used for the scene, which made the scene look grand. More than 100 gunmen were also present.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pradhan hopes to spread cheer with Centre's LPG scheme,"Bhubaneswar: The Narendra Modi government's thrust on subsidised LPG to women in rural households has helped the oil ministry shed its image of a profit-making wing into a social welfare one, Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said here on Thursday.""LPG has been so far seen as a commercial product in India and never considered as a catalyst for social change earlier,"" Pradhan said adding that his government hopes to change this, bringing clean fuel to millions of households in the country. The minister was speaking at the inaugural session of a two-day international conference on 'LPG: a catalyst for social change', which commenced here on Thursday. Experts from over 10 countries discussed the best practices on accelerating access to LPG and evolved strategies to create a thriving market for the clean fuel.Quoting a WHO report, Pradhan said 15 lakh people die every year in the world due to indoor air pollution, with five lakh of them in India alone. /""Indoor air pollution is responsible for significant number of acute respiratory diseases in young children. Traditional sources of cooking are causing indoor household pollution leading to serious health implications particularly on women and children. During the course of collection of these fuels, they face inclement weather, snakebite, bad terrain and backache. LPG is going to change all that,"" the minister said. Around 4 crore new households got LPG connections after the Modi government took over in 2014, raising the total number of families using LPG to 17.4 crore, a whopping 26 per cent, Pradhan said while talking about his ministry's social welfare scheme Ujjwala, one of the Modi government's biggest political initiatives. The oil ministry is also preparing itself to create a SAARC grid by providing LPG to neighbouring countries. ""Now we are providing LPG to Nepal and Bhutan. We are engaged in talks with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh for supplying LPG. Slowly we are trying to connect the living standards of the neighbourhood with the LPG movement,"" Pradhan added. Several African countries have already evinced interest in replicating India's models of Pahal, Sahaj and Ujjwala, the minister claimed.

1.4m lives lost in India due to air pollution in '13: Study,"India lost 1.4 million lives to air pollution in 2013, while in China the toll was 1.6 million, estimates a World Bank report released on Thursday./The report, released by the World Bank and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, shows that in 2013 more than five million deaths worldwide were attributed to health conditions caused by air pollution. About 60% of them were in the world's two most populous countries./Exposure to air pollution increases a person's risk of contracting ailments such as lung cancer, stroke, heart disease and chronic bronchitis./China and India aren't among the worst hit in absolute terms because of the sheer size of their respective populations. Even after adjusting for population, these two countries along with Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan were among the 15 nations with the highest toll per million population./China and India ranked 4th and 6th worst in the world respectively . Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan were ranked 11th, 12th and 15th on this count./The bank estimates that in 2013 Georgia saw the highest rate of air pollution deaths per million of its population at 2,117. It was followed by Cambodia with a death rate of 1,300 per million./Among the 142 countries for which the bank complied this data, there were 10 where the rate was higher than 1,000 deaths per million. Australia fared best on this parameter with an estimated death rate of 34 per million./The report also estimated that air pollution cost the world economy more than $5 trillion -purchasing power parities (PPP) at 2011 prices -in welfare losses and an additional $66 billion worth of manpower loss./China's overall welfare and manpower loss was $1.6 trillion while India lost more than $560 billion, which was equivalent to over 10% of China's and 8.5% of India's GDP./Air pollution is estimated to be the fourth leading fatal health risk worldwide after metabolic risks, dietary risks and tobacco smoke. The estimates are based on exposure to PM2.5 pollutants. It is noticeable in the report that the risks are much higher in the developing world./By damaging people's health and causing fatal diseases, air pollution can have a lasting effect on a person's economic productivity./Experts argue that typically the economically weakest section is the worst hit because of limited access to health care facilities. Thus, exposure to bad air quality and other risks will ultimately widen the existing economic inequalities, they say./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
10-20% rise in ozone levels in India; harmful for lungs and crops: Report,"While Indian cities are still grappling with the impacts of severe particulate matter (PM) pollution, a new report has raised the flag on ozone levels (O3) too./'The Cost of Air Pollution', a report by the World Bank and Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) released on Thursday , estimates that the concentrations of O3 has increased by 10 to 20% in India between 1990 and 2013. The trend is similar in neighboring countries and in Brazil, while a declining course was seen in the US and Indonesia, among others./High ozone levels are not only associated with serious health impacts like reduced lung function, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), aggravating asthma and respiratory conditions, but also with widespread crop loss./The study also estimates that total deaths due to increase in exposure to O3 increased by 50% between 1990 and 2013 in South Asia. For this report, the health and economic burden of O3 is only based on COPD incidence from it. Total deaths due to exposure to PM2.5 have also increased in South Asia during the same phase, but not as steeply as with O3./Interestingly, even though the cost of O3 related premature deaths are far lower than that of PM2.5 (both household and outdoor), O3 associated economic or welfare losses for South Asia are equivalent to that of North America. The welfare losses due to O3 exposure are to the tune of 0.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) equivalent, the report states. If you consider man days lost, it's about 0.09% of GDP equivalent, it says./Air quality experts said O3 could be a serious concern soon. ""Even before we could deal with health damage from particulate pollution we are falling into the pincer grip of ozone pollution that damages both lungs and crops. This is also the sign that emissions of toxic gases are increasing rapidly in our country. Keep in mind that for estimating health damage from ozone this report has only considered chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. The actual cost of health damage could be way higher,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury , head of Centre for Science and Environment's clean air programme./Ozone is not directly emitted from any source, it is created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight. It's mainly released from combustion sources which includes vehicles and industries./A 2014 study by scientists at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology estimated that ozone-induced damage to wheat and rice is enough to feed roughly 35% of 270 million BPL population in India./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Students come forward to help civic body keep celebration decibel low,"Kolhapur: The civic body has roped in students from three city colleges to keep a tab on air and noise pollution by processions as well as create awareness among the residents about eco-friendly and noise-free celebrations on the immersion day on Thursday. The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) will take the help of the students of the environment engineering department of the Kolhapur Institute of Technology (KIT) as well as those of the department of environmental sciences of Shivaji University, Kolhapur (SUK) to record air and noise pollution levels during the procession of the Ganesh mandals. The corporation will then use the information of the recordings to act against the mandals that have violated the sound limit. The air pollution data obtained will thus be utilised to undertake measures to control pollution during the festival period. /Ravindra Nikam, head of the environment engineering department, KIT, said, ""The KMC has identified the locations along the procession route where the readings for sound and noise pollution will be recorded through our team of six to seven students headed by a faculty member. The use of high decibel sound system affects the noise pollution figures while the heavy crowd along the routes leads to the air pollution due to dust. We are also going to study the chemical composition of the air during the procession period for further studies.""P D Raut, head of the department of environmental sciences, SUK, said, ""Massive sound systems and DJs have been found flouting the permissible noise levels in the past. Many parts of the city, including the residential areas, have experienced almost double the permissible decibel limits.""He further said that in the past, studies undertaken by the department research students have found the air pollution levels to become double as well. During the 10-day festival, the city experiences a sharp rise in air pollution causing suspended particulate matter (SPM) and respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM).The smoke associated with the SPM particles includes gases like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, both hazardous for one's health, he said.The KMC has published a list of 20 silent zones where as per the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 200, the noise levels are restricted up to the prescribed limit. The students from KIT and SUK will also study the noise level at the notified silent zones along the routes. Besides, new silent zones can be declared after the studying the results of the exercise.R K Patil, head of environmental cell of the KMC, said, ""Other agencies such as the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and the police department will have their own teams in place to record the noise pollution levels. The data generated with the help fo the KIT study will help us compare the readings to take action against the defaulting mandals.""Meanwhile, around 250 students from D Y Patil College of Engineering and Technology will participate in the awareness drive against the use of high pitch sound systems on immersion day. The students, according to the college officials, are associated with the National Service Scheme (NSS) and are studying degree and diploma courses in engineering.P D Chougule, the initiative coordinator from the college, said, ""We have been organizing this initiative for the past five years. this year too, we will be distributing pamphlets highlighting the harmful effects of high-pitch sound systems.

"Aravali mess threatens Delhi, NCR groundwater","The groundwater that supports life in Delhi and NCR is in imminent danger of getting contaminated by toxic discharge from a colossal mass of rotting filth lying in the Aravali hills. This is not a problem a day, a week, or months in the making. The gigantic environmental mess has festered over three years on a pristine stretch of Aravalis in Gurgaon's backyard, resulting, today, in 11 lakh tonnes of untreated garbage lying untreated at the site of a dysfunctional waste-to-energy plant (a truckload of garbage is 9 tonnes, to put it in perspective). And it's growing every day. By the time you read this, it will be richer by a few thousand tonnes more. /This putrid mass has been producing leachate - a fetid, viscous liquid discharge noxious for the environment - that has, over the years, not only radiated sideward, down the slopes of the hills where the plant is located but also seeped through the rocky fissures of the Aravalis in the direction of the groundwater aquifer. The leachate, fed by rain, has formed a giant cesspool behind the plant, slow-poisoning everything around it. The air has turned perennially fetid for villagers living nearby, a natural water pond in Bandhwari has been contaminated and the forest department is worried that it will soon start affecting wildlife in the region. There is no conclusive report available on how far the leachate has travelled downward and whether it has reached the groundwater table. That's largely because the Haryana and central governments have been slumbering through this crisis. Their tepid response to this grave ecological problem has only exacerbated it. Environmentalists have, in the meantime, rushed to the National Green Tribunal for a solution. They fear leachate has already reached the groundwater aquifer. Water samples collected from behind the plant compound and tested by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board showed a high level of contamination.Because of its geographical location at a higher gradient, Bandhwari is a critical recharge point for the water table. If leachate seeps into the aquifer here, it will spread rapidly to south Delhi, Faridabad and Gurgaon because the groundwater flows outwards towards the three cities from here. That's why environmentalists are extremely worried. It took decades of awareness campaigns and policy decisions to get the battle against air pollution under way in Delhi and NCR. Now, as the other basic element of life faces a grave threat, the government cannot afford another belated awakening. The pile-up of garbage at Bandhwari started in Diwali 2013 when the plant, which was jointly operated by the Gurgaon and Faridabad civic administrations, stopped functioning after a sudden fire. But the dumping of garbage, primarily household waste, from both districts continued. Rekha Singh, an environmental scientists who tested water samples from Bandhwari and has submitted the report to the NGT, believes leachate has already reached groundwater. ""The contamination from the leachate pond has started, causing fluoride, phenolic compound, cadmium and mercury poisoning,"" she told TOI. ""It may have serious health effects on residents,"" she added. Since the leachate pond is an open water body, it also endangers the health of animals and birds who drink from it. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of research at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), agreed that the continuous formation and accumulation of leachate at Bandhwari is a major concern. ""Since the waste is not being treated, the leachate may contain several harmful pollutants like nitrates, sulphates and heavy metals,"" said Roy, adding it could trigger intestinal problems and skin diseases if it mixed with groundwater. Vivek Kamboj, who has filed the petition in the NGT, explained why contamination at Bandhwari would ultimately threaten all of Delhi and all of NCR. ""A 2008 Central Ground Water Board report shows that groundwater from Bandhwari flows outwards in all directions, which is why it's a major recharge zone for downstream areas. The aquifers of the whole region are inter-connected, so contamination of groundwater in Bandhwari will lead to contamination of groundwater of the entire region,"" he said. Even when the plant was functional, villagers complained of leachate leaking from the site. A report by the HSPCB in 2013 said the plant's operator violated several provisions of municipal solid waste rules. The state government too appeared to have violated provisions of the 1999 municipal solid waste rules while setting up the plant. It did not construct a non-permeable lining system at the base and walls of the waste disposal area, nor did it make provisions for leachate collection and treatment, stipulated in Schedule 4 of the rules./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
5 held in Gzb for causing air pollution,"Ghaziabad: Five labourers, engaged in burning coal tar drums to melt their contents, were arrested on charges of disturbing peace after residents of housing societies in Raj Nagar Extension complained of air pollution in the early hours of Sunday.

90% of world's people breathe dirty air: WHO,"Nine out of 10 people in the world are breathing poor quality air, a new report by the World Health Organisation said calling on countries to take action against air pollution which is causing over six million deaths a year globally .With the use of new interactive maps, the UN agency found 92% of the world's population living in places where air quality levels exceed WHO limits.India accounts for 75% of the 8 lakh air-pollution related deaths annually in the South East Asia Region, whereas 90% of the world's casualties from poor air quality are in low-and middle-income countries, the maps show identifying specific areas where pollution levels are extremely high.""Fast action to tackle air pollution can't come soon enough,"" said Maria Neira, the head of the WHO's department of public health and environment. Asking countries to strengthen measures to control air pollution, Neira said, ""Solutions exist with sustainable transport in cities, solid waste management, access to clean household fuels and cook-stoves, as well as renewable energies and industrial emissions reductions.""The UN agency's report said 94% of the pollution-related deaths in lowand middle-income countries are due to non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular diseases, stroke, chronic obstructi ve pulmonary disease, lung cancer. Air pollution also increases the risks for acute respiratory infections.Over 6 lakh people die in In dia every year of ailments caused from air pollution such as acute lower respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, ischemic heart disease and lung cancer.The report represents the most detailed outdoor (or ambient) air pollution-related health data, by country , ever reported by WHO. /The model is based on data derived from satellite measurements, air transport models and ground station monitors for more than 3000 locations, both rural and urban. It was developed by WHO in collaboration with the University of Bath in UK.According to the report, the problem of air pollution is most acute in cities, but air in rural areas is worse than many think and poorer countries have much dirtier air than the developed world, it said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

'Data on exposure to air pollution inadequate',"AGRA: A recent study by experts from University of Massachusetts, IIT-Bombay and Desert Research Institute in the US points out that the amount of air pollution exposure data available in India is largely inadequate. And considering the growing urbanisation and other factors that are exposing more people to polluted air, efforts should be made to study the impact of pollutants on the general public to have better policy guidelines, the study said./Air pollution is a global environmental burden, and has been identified as a significant public health risk. Human exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution (AAP) and household air pollution (HAP) are important risk factors for morbidity and mortality, particularly in developing countries, the report said./The study done by Pallavi Pant (University of Massachusetts), Sarath K Guttikunda (Institute of Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai) and Richard E Peltier (Division of Atmospheric Sciences, Desert Research Institute, USA) and accepted by the Environmental Research journal for publication stated that particulate matter PM10 concentrations in India often exceed the national air quality standards. In 2010, 140 out of 176 cities were found to exceed the PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) standard values./The study said that in India, more than 50% of the population lives in areas where ambient PM2.5 levels exceed the annual PM2.5 (40 mg/m3) Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and only less than 0.01% of the population lives in areas that meet the WHO PM2.5 guideline of 10 mg/m3. This is in stark contrast to Europe, where only 10-14% of the population lives in areas that exceed the European PM2.5 guideline value (25 mg/m3)./In India, the Global Burden of Disease study (2010) identified both AAP and HAP as key risk factors in terms of disease for the Indian population. Nearly 100,000 premature deaths in India are linked to air pollution exposure. In Delhi alone, between 7,350 and 16,200 premature deaths have been attributed to PM exposure./Stating various health hazards of high PM levels, the report said a clear understanding of pollution exposure concentrations and trends and associated health effects will not only help improve the quality of life of Indian citizens, but also help improve the field of exposure science./“Data from developed countries is not readily translatable in the Indian context due to differences in source types, as well as lifestyle. Much of the research has focused on large cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata), and there is little ambient or indoor pollution data for smaller cities and towns. Characterisation of pollutant concentrations in urban areas is important since smaller cities and towns often lack public transportation options, and in many cases, fuel quality is poor. Due to haphazard urban growth, a large number of people live in close proximity to mobile, as well as point, pollution sources, increasing the risk of exposure to harmful pollutants,” Pant said./The report said most of the available data is focused on coarse PM (PM10 or PM5), and there is little information on the exposure to fine and ultra-fine PM. However, the most significant health effects are associated with fine particles, and there is a need for greater focus on characterisation of exposure to fine and ultra-fine particles, especially in urban micro-environments. Additionally, several unique sources (for example, waste burning, construction emissions) are poorly characterised or not characterised at all. Studies characterising public health impacts associated with air pollution are limited in number, as well as scope. There are no detailed analyses on various indoor sources (apart from solid fuel combustion) in India and how the concentrations might vary across households with different median income levels./One of the recommendations was that assessment of exposure to air pollution without taking into account variables such as gender and socio-economic status can lead to skewed understanding of such exposure. Thus, future research should be based on a holistic framework which considers scientific and social aspects linked to air pollution exposure./""In 2015, PM Narendra Modi launched the 'smart city' initiative. It is imperative that development plans for such cities, including consideration for breathable cities with clean air — for example, a comprehensive assessment of exposure levels in different transport modes — can also be helpful in making policy decisions, such as bicycle lane planning or the choice of fuel for public transport so as to minimise exposure to pollutants,"" Pant said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Ensure total ban on stubble burning: HC,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Thursday directed top officials of neighbouring states to ensure that there is a total ban on crop stubble burning ahead of the winter season. Burning of crop residues is the biggest contributor to air pollution in Delhi between October and November.A bench of justices B D Ahmed and Ashutosh Kumar made it clear to senior officials of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan that they must stop stubble burning in the current season since it immediately raises the pollution levels in the capital.The bench also warned that it would hold the chief secretaries of each of these states responsible if the ""law is not followed in letter and spirit"" and sought a status report on action taken.""All the state governments to submit status reports to ensure that agricultural crop residue/stubble burning is stopped,"" the bench observed, lamenting that despite repeated orders of the National Green Tribunal and the high court, stubble burning was being allowed.The HC bench reminded the state governments that the practice was banned as per law. It also noted how each year Delhi remained engulfed in a haze in the middle of October leading to increased pollution levels, the ""effects of which are felt by children and adults who develop respiratory problems"".The court sought from the Delhi government air pollution data for the months of October and November, 2015 and a chart comparing it with 2016 levels during the same period. /On its part, the AAP government told the court that based on past trends, air pollution in the capital increases every year around October and November and one of the biggest factors is unabated burning of crop stubble in the neighbouring states.The HC is hearing a PIL it initiated suo motu on the problem of air pollution in the city and has been grappling with ways to combat it. It has from time to time passed interim directions in this regard to government and other agencies. It will now take up the case for hearing on October 29./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
No data-led changes in Swachh Bharat: CSE,"There has been a huge political and financial investment on the Swachh Bharat Mission by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The programme, however, is straining to achieve the desired results. There is a struggle to bring in the much required behavioural change among people to use toilets - the backbone of the programme's success. One of the key factors for this is the lack of credible on-ground data and the absence of institutionalised tracking mechanisms to measure the health benefits of impacts of proper sanitation, or the adverse impacts of the lack of sanitation. /While large-scale campaigns are essential to drive behavioural change, it is data that will connect the issue with health impacts and lead to impact on the ground. This emerged as one of the key takeaways from a National Consultation on Sustainable Rural Sanitation organised here today by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). Currently, India does not have any mechanism for tracking water-borne diseases to shed more light about the progress on the sanitation programme. Sunita Narain, director general, CSE, pointed out, ""Our experience and our work in air pollution bears out that change happens when we make a connection to people's health. And the issue needs to be handled differently for rural and urban areas. While in the urban milieu toilets have to be linked with disposal and treatment systems, in rural areas the priorities should be to address the issue in the context of poverty, behavioural change by linking it with health, water availability, toilet design and waste disposal."" The major issue with the current approach of the Swachh Bharat Mission is the undue focus on construction of toilets. October 2, 2016 marked the completion of two years since the ambitious Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was announced from the ramparts of the Red Fort. One of the key promises made was to make India open defecation free (ODF) by 2019, by constructing toilets for 1.04 crore households, apart from 250,000 community toilets and 260,000 public toilets. The reality on the ground however paints a dismal picture, with the government leagues behind in meeting its target. According to an analysis by the recently launched Hindi edition of Down To Earth magazine, which CSE helps publish, 82.3 million (or 823 lakh) toilets are yet to be constructed across India by October 2, 2019. This means the country needs to build 2.3 million (23 lakh) toilets every month - or a formidable 56 toilets every minute - to meet the target! However, more than looking at this as just another failed government scheme, there is a larger picture that emerged during the national consultation, which brought together sanitation champions, failed states, technical experts/consultants, government officials, non-profits and donors. What emerged from the discussions was that apart from the obvious problems of poverty, lack of access to water, unavailability of land or lack of delivery of government programmes, the most critical issue was in terms of data-driven behavioural change in people. Parameswaran Iyer, secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation said, ""It took 30-40 years for people in the US to accept seat belts. In India, we are trying to compress the time frame in the context of sanitation. The challenge here is how does one scale up while maintaining quality and sustain the momentum after triggering such behavioural change."" It is clear that there is no 'one size fits all' solution. Sikkim for instance is one of the successful states that achieved complete sanitation coverage. Haryana and Kerala excelled in their respective sanitation programmes, while states like Jharkhand, Bihar and Odisha failed miserably. Rajkumar Yadav, district collector, South Sikkim, said, ""We followed a strategy of putting two different types of pressure on people - one positive and the other negative. Positive pressure was put through campaigns and social messaging across sections of society. Negative pressure was applied by restricting and denying government benefits to those who haven't constructed toilets or haven't given up open defecation. This has helped create an overall positive impact."" It is clear that a range of solutions is required, accounting for the varied geographies, socio-political setting and other factors in our diverse country - from technological solutions, to behaviour change, to scientific data gathering to policy interventions. ""CSE has started the process of drawing out shit flow diagrams to understand the flow of faecal matter. We are also setting up India's first faecal sludge laboratory to test technologies for their effectiveness,"" said Narain. This will be a crucial first step towards such data gathering, especially in understanding sanitation in the rural context. ""Rural sanitation is more complex due to dimensions of poverty, and is much more extensive and inhuman, especially in the context of gender. World's wicked problems are about gender -- whether cooking fuels, toilets or clean water,"" added Narain./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Centre to study air quality, health link opened","CHENNAI: With studies showing how exposure to household air pollution can lead to respiratory infections, adverse pregnancy outcomes and heart disease, Sri Ramachandra University and Indian Council of Medical Research opened a centre for advanced research on air quality, climate and health on Thursday.""We need research in environmental and occupational health to generate evidence for key policy decisions leading to sustained actions,"" said ICMR director general Dr Soumya Swaminathan.""We have conducted long-term studies with ICMR on the impact of indoor air pollution. At this centre, we want to move a step further and research possible interventions to reduce pollution and its impact on heath,"" said Dr Kalpana Balakrishnan. The studies will be funded by international organisations, including UN Foundation (Global Alliance for Clean Cook stoves), Public Health Institute, US, and US National Institutes of Health. Dr S P Thiyagarajan, dean research at SRMC, said the centre would conduct a randomised controlled trial of LPG stove and fuel distribution in 800 households in Tamil Nadu as part of global effort to deliver evidence regarding potential health benefits of clean fuel use for women and children. tnn/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Civic workers take to burning waste in most areas in Belagavi,"BELAGAVI: The inherent contradiction in the Belagavi City Corporation's (BCC) emphasis on technology to monitor waste disposal, and the instructions issued by the garbage contractors to their workers to resort to a more primary form of disposal - burning - is hard to escape. Belagavi has to compulsorily adopt scientific disposal of garbage, since it has been selected for the Smart City project. Unfortunately, contractors appear to be telling their workers to just burn the waste, which is only compounding the problem of air pollution. /Trash collected from bins installed across the city, and in the market areas, too are being burnt, a practice that is particularly rampant in the extension areas. Moreover, plastic waste is being set ablaze as well. The disturbing practice of torching garbage comes against the backdrop of BCC's door-to-door waste collection campaign. While waste is collected regularly in some of the more affluent localities, residents in most other areas have pointed out that garbage collection is highly irregular, prompting them to dump it on the side of the road or open spaces. A resident of Shahapur, Manjunath Patil said, ""I have raised objections to the practice of burning waste, but to no avail. We can't go on arguing with everyone, including the civic workers.""Moreover, civic authorities have not been proactive in creating awareness, and curbing the harmful practice. Burning of waste is widely prevalent in market areas. A trader on old PB Road, Shivaji Kelkar said, ""We need to dispose the waste on an hourly basis, but it not being done. Those who are unaware of the consequences, are setting it on fire. The stench is unbearable when plastic and rubber waste is burnt. Citizens are forced to put with the heavy quantity of smoke.""E nviromentalist Prof SY Prabhu said that burning of rubber and plastic waste could not be condoned. ""If this waste is supplied to road construction contractors, they will use the soiled rubber along with hot bitumen to asphalt roads. It is the duty of the civic body to put in place a zero waste management system,"" he added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
50% rise in air pollution in 10 days,"GURGAON: There has been a 50% rise in air pollution in Gurgaon in the last 10 days as compared to last month. Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) attributes this increase to stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana and low wind speed after rain early this month. The situation, according to the board will become worse ahead of Diwali.While the average concentration of PM2.5 in the city was 39.34 micrograms per cubic metre in August and 54.46 micrograms per cubic metre in September, it increased to an average of 111.23 micrograms per cubic metre in the first 10 days of October, according to data from HSPCB.HSPCB data also indicates a decrease in wind speed -- while September's average wind speed was 1.63 meters per second, it came down to an average of 1.02 metres per second in the first 10 days of October.""Delhi and NCR cities report an increase in air pollution every year as soon as paddy burning season begins in Haryana and Punjab. /Also, the decrease in the wind speed after it rained on October 4 has led to increase in concentration of PM2.5,"" said an official of HSPCB.Talking about various initiatives taken by HSPCB to keep a check over paddy burning this year, Bhupinder Singh, regional officer of HSPCB, said, ""The board has taken several initiatives. We have been running awareness campaigns in villages and conducting regular meetings with gram panchayats to spread awareness on ill-effects of paddy burning. Paddy burning not only causes air pollution, but reduces the concentration of nutrients in soil and reduces its fertility. Besides, we are using banners and posters to spread awareness in the city."" Some experts expressed concern over air pollution caused by crackers and effigy burning on Dushehrra. ""The situation starts getting worse in October every year, with the change of season, paddy burning and arrival of Dushehrra and Diwali. I request people to say no to crackers this year and go for laser shows and street plays instead of burning effigies. It will help bring down air pollution during winters,"" said Prof Sushil Dayal, a city-based environmental scientist.Doctors, on the other hand, advise people prone to breathing problemls and skin diseases to stay indoors on Dushehrra. ""It might sound weird. But we are expecting the situation to go worse this year as we have already started getting some cases of breathlessness. People, especially children who have asthma, bronchitis or any other respiratory diseases are advised to stay indoors on Dushehrra, particularly in the evening,"" said Dr Kartik Deshwal, a pulmonologist.""Nearly 100,000 premature deaths in India are linked to air pollution exposure, says a Global Burden of Disease study. Apart from respiratory diseases, air pollutants can cause severe damage to skin. Air pollutants rob skin cells of oxygen, and cause free radical production in the skin. Intake of vitamin C should be increased in diet at this time,"" said Dr Nivedita Dadu, a dermatologist./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Khanna sees fall in air pollution levels,"KHANNA: Even as Khanna has achieved the dubious distinction of being among the world's 20 most polluted cities in the world, the recent data of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) suggests some fall in the air pollution levels in this industrial city, though they continue to be higher than normal. The data suggests that the annual average for Khanna (recorded at two observatories) was 116.5 ppm (parts per million) in 2012, and after that it witnessed a jump and was recorded at 178.5 in 2013. The data suggests that RSPM (Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter) level for the city fell to 162.3 in 2014, and further to 122.5ppm last year. Environment experts say Khanna has been notorious for high air pollution levels for quite a long time now. /""Khanna has been one of the hotspots of air pollution, and has been showing high levels for quite some time now. The normal value for air pollution levels is around 100ppm, but if the value is more than 120 ppm, then there is a problem. The Punjab Pollution Control Board or the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) can make a local assessment of pollution sources, and frame an action plan to control the problem,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Research and Advocacy wing of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).Local doctors say air pollution is badly affecting the health of city residents. ""Around four years ago, we would get just 5 -6 cases of respiratory ailments, including asthma and other allergic respiratory diseases at our hospital, but now the number is around 8 -10 a day.

WHAT ARE YOU SMOKING? - Air quality worst early in the morning,"PM10 Far Exceeds Safe Limits In Parts Of Gurgaon, DwarkaWinter's coming. And, already, the signs are ominous: Qutab Plaza in Gurgaon recorded an average PM10 (coarse, pollution particles) level of 421 micrograms per cubic metres between September 20 and October 7, which is more than four times the national 24-hour safe standard.Similarly, Dwarka sector 22 recorded an average PM10 level of 203 micrograms per cubic metres during the same period -twice the national safe standard. Sector 13 in RK Puram, at the other extreme, recorded an average PM10 level of only 20 micrograms per cubic metres -lower than the WHO guidelines.All this has been revealed by the information collected by the Indian Open Data Association as a part of an air pollution data experiment.The data indicate a large variation in air pollution levels in different parts of the city. While the Central Pollution Control Board and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee together monitor 11 locations this project has now brought together trends from different parts of NCR where air quality isn't monitored by any government agency .IODA, a data startup, deployed low-cost air-quality monitors at several locations last year and has just started analysing the trends. /Last year, IODA had called for volun teers to install these monitors outside their homes or offices Finally , 30 monitors were installed that have made continuous readings of PM10 and PM2.5(fine, respirable air pollutants).Mrutyunjay Mishra, co-founder of IODA, said: ""PM10 levels are breaching the safe standard most of the times, particularly from night up to mid-morning. We also noticed that particulate pollution peaked from safe levels to poor within a fortnight from September 20 to October 7, indicating a strong association with the weather.""PM10 levels at locations under IODA are ""poor"" mostly between 8 pm and 10 am and the worst during early mornings. While the PM10 averages are high at many locations, the range is very large -for instance, Qutab Plaza recorded a maximum PM10 level of 788 micrograms per cubic metres during the fortnight compared to a minimum of only 56 micrograms per cubic metres.The DPCC and CPCB data may also give us a slightly skewed picture. Areas such as Anand Vihar are always seen to be far more polluted than south Delhi locations. More localised monitoring may actually overturn these findings. For instance, IODA data show parts of Dwarka and Gurgaon to have very poor air quality.""The DPCC and CPCB devices are super-sensitive and their readings are always higher than what the low-cost ones measure. Having a network of low-cost sensors is important for creating public awareness because they show the same trends as the government's monitoring stations.The data is more granular and we can scale up deployment of low-cost sensors to cover more areas,"" said Mishra.There is usually a 5-10% variance in air pollution levels monitored by the government's stations and lowcost sensors. The data also helps make a direct correlation with sources of pollution. Qutab Plaza, for example, has too many construction projects around it. ""It's obvious such high levels are because of construction dust,"" said Mishra.The idea of tracking air quality through low cost monitors was first floated by Mishra at the MIT's Kumbathon last year in Nashik. ""The idea was to make data truly open because data is knowledge and helps solve problems. I realised people wanted to contribute,"" said Mishra, who along with his team, procured 51 low-cost air-quality monitoring kits. So far, the team has invested nearly Rs 20 lakh into the project.Asutosh Dikshit, CEO of United Residents Joint Action, for instance, tied up with IODA to mount these monitors at its locations.""We decided to install them because seeing these levels will push people to change their behaviour. Air pollution levels will eventually impact property prices too and that is a very sensitive issue for residents,"" said Dikshit./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Rising air pollution taking a toll on tourism in Haridwar,"HARIDWAR: The rising air pollution in the city which is attributed to several factors like vehicular smoke, emissions from industries and the most rampant -- open burning of garbage and dry leaves in many parts of the city -- is steadily taking a toll on the tourism business in the holy city. Hotels, restaurants and other tourism industry stakeholders admit that during the past few years, pilgrims and tourists visiting the city have been affected by the rising air pollution. “I estimate that in the last 5-6 years, there has been a 30-35 per cent fall in tourist numbers in Haridwar. Many tourists now spend only a limited time in Haridwar and then turn towards Rishikesh or other places where the air is a little better and the areas more clean,” says Sumit Srikunj, a travel agent./Those who have lived in Haridwar for many years say the situation is worrisome because the city is regarded as one of the holiest in the country and had been known for its serene and peaceful atmosphere. “Earlier, it was possible to sit for hours near the Har-ki-Pauri and enjoy the serenity of the Ganga ghats, but now it is simply not possible to do so. There are heaps of open garbage lying at several places and with winters approaching, these heaps are often lit causing unwarranted pollution,” says Shiv Sharma who has lived in the city since the last three decades./Open burning of garbage is not an uncommon sight in Haridwar. In the absence of a proper system of garbage disposal, many people and institutions find it the easiest way to dispose of trash. A resident near the Har-ki-Pauri who did not wish to be named said that clothes left at the ghats by pilgrims in great quantity are often burnt in the open. Dharamshalas, hotels and ashram also resort to this practice at times, she alleged./Purushottam Sharma Gandhivadi, president of the Ganga Sabha, which is responsible for the upkeep of the Har-ki-Pauri denied that clothes left at the ghats as ""per tradition"" are burnt in the open. He said that they are “collected in drums by our employees and then handed over to the nagar nigam sweepers."" However, he acknowledged that “the Ganga Sabha can play a more active role in creating awareness about air pollution.”/With the general consensus being that the occupancy in hotels has seen a dip in numbers primarily due to the pollution problem, it’s time that other stakeholders also come forward to take the initiative to put an end to the most visible forms of air pollution like the open burning of waste -- which can be easily curbed -- and also put pressure on district officials to ensure that this practice is put to an end in the city./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Mumbaikars' lung function 35% lower than in westerners',"Mumbai: The World Health Organisation’s recent statement that 90% of people across the globe breathe polluted air should cause greater alarm in Mumbai than in most other places. The lung function of Mumbaikars is at least 30% to 35% lower than that of healthy Europeans and Americans, a new study has found. The test involved 1,000-plus healthy people who came to a south Mumbai hospital for a checkup./The study, presented at the European Respiratory Society meeting in London recently, not only shows that Mumbaikars have a reduced lung capacity but stresses that the gap between Indians and Caucasians has been worsening over the past 20 years. “As part of the lung function test, we ask people to breathe out air forcefully. What the study has showed us is if a person could breathe out three litres of air a decade ago, he is breathing out almost 20% less now,” pulmonologist Dr Sujeet Rajan said. According to him, the worsening lung capacity is related to environmental pollution and changing dietary habits./The study looked at lung function using a spirometry test for 1,041 healthy people, 34% of them women. “Using statistical methods, we found that the lung function of Mumbaikars was 25-30% lower than Europeans and 32-38% less than healthy Americans,” Dr Rajan, who consults at Bombay Hospital near New Marine Lines, said./A study done by chest specialist Dr S R Kamat more than 20 years ago and published in Lung India had showed that Indian test values were 20-24% lower compared with some other ethnic groups./Incidentally, Indian lungs are known to be smaller in comparison to other ethnicities. “A 15-20% correction in lung function parameters is always allowed when Indians are compared with Europeans. But how can we account for a difference of 30% or more?” Dr Rajan said, adding, “With increasing slowing of vehicular traffic across the city, especially in the suburbs, air pollution is definitely high.”/Air pollution levels in most Indian cities, including Mumbai, are among the highest in the world; with winter inversion barely a month away, pollution levels are likely to soar. But it’s not just the dipping lung function that worries doctors. Chest specialist Dr Sanjeev Mehta said Indian lungs were known to be smaller than their western counterparts. “We know that Indians suffer heart attacks more often than Westerners because we have smaller arteries. We know we have smaller lungs, but if our lung function is going to reduce because of air pollution. We are staring at a greater health calamity than we thought,” said Dr Mehta./In fact, the recently released Global Burden of Diseases Study has shown that a third of deaths in India are caused by heart attacks, lung obstructions and strokes. Similarly, a study done in a Mumbai hospital last year showed that 40% of the 87 people tested had lower-than-ideal lung function, or weak lungs./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Children and elderly with lung diseases are most vulnerable to such smoke that contains sulphur dioxide, which causes throat irritation and breathlessness.Dr Prakash Vichare, a veteran paediatrician in the city, said, ""Number of children with respiratory issues have increased in the last few years. /People are so habituated to the use of firecrackers during the festival that it is hard to say preserve our environment now. Allergic Bronchitis and asthma is what we have observed as one of the major outcome of this pollution. Kids suffer the most due to air pollution and it can even prove fatal, if not cured on time.""Vichare also said that infants should be given proper sleep or rest. Diwali celebration can disrupt their routine and ultimately the health. ""Air pollution reaches higher than normal levels during Diwali. Hence, citizens need to be extra cautious as well as responsible while bursting firecrackers,"" he said.Elaborating further, Vichare said, ""Firecrackers contain chemicals like sulphur dioxide that is mainly responsible for respiratory problems such as cough, breathlessness and irritation in the throat. It also worsens pre-existing conditions such as asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia.""He warned people - with underlying lung and heart diseases - to stay away from smoke of fireworks, and take their medication regularly, eat fresh fruits and drink plenty of water.A city-based eye specialist, said, ""Though injuries by firecrackers are common during Diwali one can avoid such incidents by knowing basic safety measures. Absence of parental supervision and failure to maintain a safe distance from firecrackers can lead to mishaps.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Diwali 2016: Children say 'no crackers' for a cleaner Diwali,"NASHIK: Many city students have resolved not to burst crackers or to burst only one firecracker that has minimum sound and air pollution during Diwali. Rishika Singh, a nine-year-old, has forbidden her parents from buying firecrackers this Diwali in an attempt to avoid pollution and also to save money.""We have been taught about eco-friendly celebrations in our school and we will be observing it. We too have a dog and it gets frightened at the sound of a small cracker. /My neighbour's grandmother is old and she keeps coughing due to smoke,"" she said.Mitali's parents Rajan and Kavita Tiwari were surprised at their eight-year-old daughter's stand a year ago. ""We initially blamed the school for not letting our children enjoy. But we realised that Mitali was firm in her belief and enjoyed last Diwali without crackers. This year, we did not compel her and have also not bought any crackers for her. Afterall rituals were made by human beings. God did not ask us to burst crackers and cause harm to the environment,"" said Kavita. Piyush (10) and Jatin Shah (12) have not been bursting crackers since three years after they learnt about the harmful effects on the environment. ""We have also been able to convince many of our friends and some neighbours to give up on crackers,"" said Jatin.His mother Namita said they were initially surprised and felt that children derived happiness only after bursting crackers. ""We were wrong. They made us realise that we were burning money. We also began respecting nature,"" said Namita. Manav Utthan Manch is conducting Cracker Free Diwali on Sunday, an activity that they have been conducting every year.

"Crop fires wrap capital in a smog screen, hit air quality","New Delhi: Crop fires that continue to rage in Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh have started impacting the air quality in the capital, experts said as satellite images showed the northern plains covered in smog.Delhi's air quality index plunged to ""very poor"" levels on Sunday, and remained there on Monday. Sunday's satellite image of the region from NASA's EOSDIS website indicates an increase in the number of crop fires in Punjab, northern Haryana and the Terai region of Uttar Pradesh, as compared with the previous week. The image also shows the region thick smog/smoke over the region.""Punjab and Haryana farmers started burning their paddy stubbles more than two weeks ago. /Smoke from those fires have now spread across the northern plains, as the satellite image shows, and have started contributing to air pollution in Delhi and other cities,"" said a scientist at SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research), which monitors air quality in the capital.Calm atmospheric conditions and falling temperatures are causing the smoke to hang over the region, the expert said.The effect of the smog can be seen across cities in the region. According to the daily bulletin released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index on Monday was at ""very poor"" levels in Kanpur, Lucknow and Muzaffarpur, and in the ""poor"" category in Agra and Patna. In Delhi, the AQI on Monday was 306, only slightly better than 318 the previous day. SAFAR calculated Monday's AQI in the capital at 316. An index reading of above 300 is categorised as ""very poor"", which is just a notch below the ""severe"" level (above 400). Crop fires in neighbouring states, despite a ban on the practice, usually last till the second half of November. How much effect the fires have on Delhi's air quality depends on meteorological factors such as wind direction and speed, as well as temperatures./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Urban sprawl choking Ahmedabad's green future,"AHMEDABAD: The civic body of Ahmedabad may be claiming the city is heading towards a `smart and green' future, but a true bird's-eye view by experts has exposed the `green' claims to be a far cry from reality. Two researchers from IIT-Mumbai used Isro's Landsat images to show how the increasing `urban sprawl' was eating away into the green spaces of Ahmedabad, choking its lungs and gobbling up water bodies. The findings show a future filled with dust and concrete, unless authorities move from speech to action.Satellite images reveal that in the city spread over 464 sq km, between 2009 and 2016, built-up area increased from 33% to 53%, while areas with vegetation decreased from 33% to 27%.After having spent crores over developing policy documents and greening drives, and even collecting carbon credits for the same, it's time for the civic body to act upon the Landsat images which warn Amdavadis of a unsustainable future. /The study conducted by Minakshi Goswami and M V Khire of the Centre of Studies in Resources Engineering, IIT, Mumbai, show that of the total land in the city, 43% is under residential use, while 15% is under industries.""The UN's flagship cities conference, Habitat III, which met in Ecuador on October 17, had urban experts and policy makers deliberating on how to ""prevent and contain urban sprawl"" as there were serious implications,"" says a senior Cept university professor.""We should not take urban sprawl lightly as it has many negative consequences for re sidents and the environment, such as higher water and air pollution, increased traffic fatalities and jams, increased car dependency ,"" said the Cept professor. ""It also results in higher taxes, increased runoff into lakes, harmful effects on human health, including higher rates of obesity , high blood pressure, hypertension and chronic diseases,"" he added.Goswami and Khire point out in their study that, ""The growth of the built-up area in the outer region of the city in 2009 was towards north, that is Gota and Gandhinagar, and east, which will be towards Changodar and Sanand.""The study says , ""Growth of the built up area in the outer region of the city in 2011, and now, is towards west (Oganj) and southeast, which is towards Vatva."" ""The north side is growing because of Gandhinagar. The development along west side is due to the large number of manufacturing industries along this corridor specially Sanand Tata nano plant, and the growth in southeast is due to the location of existing industrial estates in Vatva and Odhav ,"" says the study .Times ViewThe 2013 development plan for Ahmedabad lays heavy emphasis on greenery and creating more open spaces in the city. Over the past three years, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority have done precious little on these fronts.

City vendors see drop in sale of firecrackers,"THANE: Everyone is counting days for Diwali, which is one of the most awaited festival of the year. Every year, bursting of firecrackers used to begin a week or two before Diwali. But this year, this has been less. /This can be seen by the sale of firecrackers in the city which has dropped as compared to the previous years.One of the reasons behind this may be because of the increase in awareness among adults and children about the ill-effects of firecrackers on the environment.Ashwini Pathak (38), a Vrindavan resident, said, ""We never wanted to celebrate Diwali with firecrackers, but our 12-year-old used to force us to buy a few as he would burst them with his friends. However, he recently started helping out at an animal NGO. There he realised how the noise affects animals. So, this year, he refused to buy any crackers and even convinced his friends to reduce their fireworks shopping. In fact, he convinced them to light only sparklers (fuljhadis) this time.""Another resident, Shubhik Sharma also shared the same views. ""Last year, we were bursting crackers in our building and one of the rockets went into my neighbour's house and broke a flower pot. The smell of smoke hovered around for a while which resulted in many of us getting a headache. Since then, we decided not to use crackers. Instead, we are lighting our compound and building with LED diyas,"" said 17-year-old Shubhik, a Devdayanagar resident.With many environmentally-conscious denizens now shying away from these noise and air polluting hazards, the stock of fireworks in city stores is gathering dust. ""The sales of crackers till now has been low. We don't know the exact reason behind it yet. It can either be is because many residents are refraining from using them or the fireworks' stalls are yet to be set up at the grounds in Kopri, Shivaji maidan and so on due to a delay in securing permissions. Whatever the reason, we hope the sales pick up soon,"" said Sanjay Ahuja, a vendor from Kopri.Meanwhile, many housing societies are creating awareness by putting up notices and sending out messages on social media sites. Rajesh Kumar, a Brahmand resident, said, ""We cannot force anyone to do things. However, we have created a WhatsApp group for our society members where we discuss the effects of using crackers on the environment.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Respiratory ailment rising in Haridwar due to air pollution,"DEHRADUN: The situation of air pollution is going from bad to worse in Haridwar as per the residents and medical experts both, especially in past one decade the holy city has registered escalated respiratory patients. The residents who once enjoyed the serene ganges and cool breeze sometimes land up cursing themselves for making home in the city. ""We bought home here considering green environment, clear water and fresh air but now there is no trace of clear air. My both the kids are struck by asthma so is the condition of my father who is 78. Me and my wife literally regret the decision, city has turned into a total chaos."" /said Mahesh Tiwari, a resident of Haridwar who is actually a native of Kanpur. The doctors also agreed to the fact that places such as Balmiki Chaouraha, railway station road, Chandaracharya chowk and Arya Nagar Chauraha are the hotspots of air pollution and majority of their respiratory patients hale from these places and Haridwar is no more a safe place to roam without mask on face, ""In the current state Haridwar is a horrible city for children from 3 to 10-year as they are short height in this age and the vehicular pollution which is escalating immensely in Haridwar due to illegally moving vikram and tempos in the city hit them most. Past decade has seen rampant cases of chronic choryza, bronchitis, asthma attacks and asthmatic bronchitis in children."" said Dr. Vijay Verma, senior consultant physician, Haridwar. Recalling the tranquil environment of yesteryear, one of the elderly persons from the city, Aviral Mishra said that earlier they have tangas and rikshas which maintained the beauty and purity of holy city by all means but now these environment-friendly mode of transport have vanished. ""We want the olden culture of tanga and buggies to restart in our city, it will help to maintain the ecological balance of Haridwar in multiple ways. Not that early, but barely 15 years ago the city had ample of ecological safer mode of transport which really helped the environment of city to remain pure but now it's a hell out here."" he added. Meanwhile, pressing on the need to send expert doctors from health department to Mecca in Saudi Arabia for learning ways to manage health system, Dr. Vijay, said, ""Every year Makkah welcomes crores of people but we never see rising pollution or communicable diseases in the city owing to its 'pilgrimage' status like that of Haridwar. But our city's health graph in last ten years has simply fallen among all the 13 districts of Uttarakhand. Department or government should send its civic and health experts to world's pilgrim sight to actually learn the ways of managing the sea of tourists to be able to manage events such as ardh-kumbh, kumbh and various monthly fests when Haridwar is flocked by several lakh people.""

"Don't let smoke, sound, burns spoil festive fun","Lucknow: People suffering from asthma, bronchitis and other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) should take extra care of themselves during Diwali as experts say their medical condition can aggravate around the festival./Last year around Diwali, the tiniest form of suspended air pollutant - PM 2.5- had seen an increase of 152% from the previous year, according to the ambient air quality report of Lucknow by Indian Institute of Toxicology Research Centre (IITR). Being small in size, PM 2.5 travels easily through the respiratory tract, sticking to the lungs, causing short term effects such as eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, coughing, sneezing, runny nose and shortness of breath, apart from worsening asthmatic and heart conditions./Long term exposure causes increased rate of chronic bronchitis and reduced lung function. Heart patients should also take prevention./""Season change with smoke in the air creates additional problems when the pollen and pollutants in air combine. Patients should not overdose or under-dose their medication and take expert help if breathing issues worsen,"" said Dr Ved Prakash of respiratory department of King George's Medical University (KGMU). Not just respiratory issues, ear, nose and throat (ENT) are also under threat from the high decibels of sound and air pollution. ""Every year, there is an influx of 2-2.5% patients of acoustic trauma post-Diwali. Sound levels should be maintained around 80-85 decibels and with cracker noise at around 130 decibels, buzzing, irritation, dizziness, long term hearing impairment and other ear problems start. If not treated early, some might even become irreversible,"" cautioned ENT surgeon Dr Rakesh Srivastava./Air pollution due to Diwali crackers also causes nasal problems like breathing difficulties and collection of fluid behind the ear that may lead to hearing loss. With respiratory issues, the heart is also at a higher risk and irritability, blood pressure and blood sugar rise./""Night coughing is a phenomenon that increases during Diwali. Smoke adds to it and it is advisable to take an anti-allergic seven days prior and post-Diwali. If problem persists, nebulisers and inhalers should be used on prescription,"" added Dr Srivastava./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pollution jumps up even before Diwali fireworks,"Gurgaon: Smoke from uncontrolled bursting of crackers during Diwali is yet to envelop the city, but current air pollution levels have already risen steeply compared with September. The spike is the result of a combination of rampant stubble burning in farms in Punjab and Haryana as well as low wind speed.Pollution control board officials claimed air pollution in Gurgaon at this time of the year is lower than elsewhere in NCR, thanks to ongoing awareness drives against stubble burning and cracker bursting. But doctors in the city begged to differ, citing a steep rise in the number of patients with respiratory diseases. /Dr Himanshu Garg, Artemis Hospital said, ""In the past 2-3 months, we witnessed 20-30 cases of choking, chest infection, asthma and COPD. They have risen by 25% to 30%, which is shocking, considering winter hasn't even begun. Such symptoms are more common later, when smoke particles turn into smog.""

State plans anti-cracker drive for cleaner air,"Kolkata: Alarmed over the deteriorating air quality of the city, which goes through the roof during Kali Puja and Diwali, the state government is planning a ""say no to crackers"" campaign next year. A study on the city's ambient air quality during the festival over last three years has prompted the government to go for the big push.Citing the report, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) is planning an aggressive awareness drive - through banners and hoardings and appeals on radio and TV - making Kolkatans conscious the ill-effects of smoke that belches out every time a cracker is burst.WBPCB has concluded that firecrackers had contributed to the worse air quality during Kali Puja, the levels spiked further in Diwali. The level of pollution called particulate matter, abbreviated as PM10 and fine particulate matter or PM 2.5 was 320 microgrammes per cubic metre and 193.5 mg/cubic metre, making Kolkata emerge as an air pollution hotspot during festivities. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards in India for PM2.5 is 60 microgram/m3 and that of PM10 is 100 microgram/m3. With cooler temperatures on November 10 and 11 (Diwali and Kali Puja), there was enough moisture in the air and the atmosphere holding capacity quite high for particles emitted by firecrackers, causing a dense haze. /Thanks to the humidity around the time, particles emitted from fireworks ""sat on water droplets and multiplied, resulting in more particles in the suspended air itself"", in a process called secondary particle formation.""Kolkata air, already brimming with pollutants, worsened with festival fireworks, the analysis shows,"" said WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra.The WBPCB data looks at the ""ambient"" or general pollution levels across the city, which is usually gathered at a height of 6m and often away from the sources of pollution. The ""exposure"" levels are closer to the nose and represent the air that is being breathed in. ""Exposure levels are usually three to four times higher than ambient levels. Crackers not only push up the pollution level but also lace it with deadly cancer-causing substances,"" said consultant pulmonologist Raja Dhar. According to Dhar, his hospital, Fortis, recorded a 40% increase in admissions related to COPD excerbations last year.Rudra said, ""Historically, Deepavali is the festival of lights and not burning crackers. It's time we reverted to our past, for the sake of the present and the future.""This year, WBPCB has started several stringent measures like intense raids to stop sale of sound crackers. ""But the more challenging task is to keep the air clean. For this, the anti-pollution body has started speaking to housing cooperatives so that they could start campaigns against firecrackers, even the silent ones that inflict so harm, especially on children and the elderly,"" said Rudra.Earlier this year, the CSE (Centre for Science and Environment) had found that the city's air pollution level is much higher than the permissible limit and recommended that Kolkata should start acting on emergency measures.Anumita Roychowdhury, head of CSE's air pollution control campaign, said, ""Toxic fumes are very high in Kolkata. The government should come up with implementation strategies to inform people to take precautions during Diwali, staying indoors on these days or asking children not to expose themselves to such firecrackers.""The sole silver-lining: the PC10 was lower last year than Kali Puja of 2014, when it had plummeted to 319, because wind velocity was slow. In all likelihood, the air quality during Diwali 2016 may not be inferior to that of Diwali 2015, thanks to warmer temperature and good wind speed.Finally, Prakash Javadekar, the Union minister of environment, forest and climate change, had appealed to children to refrain from bursting crackers in Delhi during Diwali.

"Haze blankets Delhi, air quality season's worst","NEW DELHI: Delhi's air quality recorded ""severe"" levels on Saturday, a day before Diwali. A pall of smog was hanging over the city since morning. As forecast by IMD and SAFAR, the wind speed was very low, touching zero at times, which caused pollutants to accumulate very close to the surface. /The Delhi government, meanwhile, blamed the high pollution levels on the farm stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. On Saturday, it shared a NASA image from October 26 showing crop fires in these states. ""Agricultural fires in the fields of neighbouring states, particularly Punjab and Haryana, are a major contributor in the deterioration of ambient air quality, which will accentuate due to inversion and calm meteorological conditions currently prevailing,"" a Delhi government statement said. Environment minister Imran Hussain reiterated his appeal to the residents to stay away from crackers on Diwali. The government had seized illegally-imported crackers at Qutab Roa, Moti Nagar, Rajouri Garden and Patel Nagar recently. This is the first time this season that the overall AQI (Air Quality Index) for the city recorded severe. A pollution emergency occurs when AQI is severe-even healthy people can be affected by such high levels of PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles). It can seriously affect those with existing health conditions. A 24-hour average pre-Diwali monitoring for three residential areas-RK Puram, Mandir Marg and Punjabi Bagh between 6am on October 28 and 6 am on October 29-showed the PM 2.5 average to be higher than 250 micrograms per cubic metres at RK Puram and Punjabi Bagh, more than four times the national safe standard and 10 times the WHO benchmark. The PM 10 average was 543 at RK Puram, which is five times the national safe standard and about 10 times the WHO cut-off mark. ""IMD had forecast that wind speed is going to drop and SAFAR had predicted air quality will be severe. The government should have issued a health advisory, urging people not to burn any crackers. Soft messages don't work,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of CSE's clean air campaign. ""There is enough evidence now that such high levels of pollution aggravate existing conditions and trigger heart attacks, strokes and other respiratory issues. In fact, pollution is responsible for more than 50% of heart attack cases."" The health ministry's steering committee report on air pollution lists mortality due to cardiovascular and respiratory disease, chronic respiratory disease incidence (asthma, COPD, etc), lung cancer, chronic cardiovascular disease, among others as a result of long-term exposure to high levels of pollution. If AQI continues to be severe for the next couple of days, it would fall under Beijing's red alert category when the Chinese capital shuts schools and industries, reduces power plant emissions and restricts car usage./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

According to data with the state pollution control board, the average PM10 and PM5 amount in the air has been increasing since 2013. While the PM10 amount during 2013-14 was more or less equal at 215 and 213, it shot up to a massive 320 in 2015. ""Air in northern parts of the city is more polluted, though it might not be only related to crackers. In some areas, road congestion leads to pollution as well,"" said Sudipto Bhattacharjee of SAFE.According to former chief environment law officer Biswajit Mukherjee, a plan should be chalked out to control air pollution. ""There was a plan discussed way back in 2011 to do something to prevent air pollution caused by firecrackers but it did not materialise. The issue should be looked into seriously now,"" he said.The Live monitoring on Kolkata US Consulate air pollution: Real time air pollution index (AQI) has predicted PM2.5 may hit 137-158 AQI near the US Consulate on Diwali night which is considered to be unhealthy. According to the pollution control board reading at one of the busy intersections, PM10 level reached 227.4 (pg/m3) by 6pm on Saturday evening.The higher the level of PM10 in air, the more it has an impact on human health. The sub-types of PM10, including the suspended particulate matter (SPM) and the respirable suspended particle (RSP), cause respiratory and other ailments, particularly among children and the elderly who suffer from asthma and other lung diseases.According to experts, pollution level increasing during Kalipujo and post Diwali is a routine affair but what is more alarming is the sudden rise of pollution due to bursting of firecrackers and its intensity. Not only PM 10, the toxicity of the air increases by the rise of sulphor dioxide. It takes long for air pollution to drop to normal levels since the onset of winter changes air density and that causes increase in harmful dust particles. Under the standards fixed by the Central Pollution Control Board, about 12 chemicals, including sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, SPM, RSP, ozone and lead, need to be measured to determine air quality.""Burning crackers leads to release of sulpher dioxide, carbon dixoide and nitrogen dioxide, among others, in the air. These gases lead to acute breathing problem. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients will have to be more careful. The toxic gas may also affect chronic bronchitis,"" said Debashis Saha, senior consulting physician at AMRI (Salt Lake). ""Pollution leads to cough among children. Mainly those suffering from asthma should be careful,"" added Neille Sarkar, Paeditrician of Ramkrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan. ""It becomes difficult to breathe during this time of the year. So I prefer to stay indoors,"" said Deepa Mehrotra, a librarian in a college who suffers from asthma./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Dollop of green thought before Diwali dash,"PUNE: Experts and citizens worried about firecracker pollution say it is not enough to quibble over annual marginal changes to tackle peak pollution during Diwali.They stress on the need to sensitize the community and to have in place a judicious mix of regulatory controls to protect public health.Air pollution is now the fifth-largest killer in India.Every year, 6.2 lakh premature deaths occur in India from air pollution-related diseases, according to `The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) report' by the World Health Organization.The New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), in a statement, observed several efforts are already under way to tackle this problem. These include noise regulations for firecrackers, a ban on unregulated Chinese firecrackers, time restrictions for firecrackers along with an advisory on distance from residence, schools and hospitals.Enforcement however, has posed a serious challenge.CSE executive director (research and advocacy) Anumita Roychowdhury says there is no room for additional pollution in cities, especially from firecrackers that not only push up the pollution spike, but also, lace it with deadly cancer-causing substances.""I think the ethos of celebrations will have to change. Any effort to stop this (bursting firecrackers) by force or issuing orders will not work as political parties will say celebrations are being targeted. People say there is garbage scattered everywhere, lakhs of vehicles emit poisonous smoke and overall cleanliness has gone for a toss.Then why target a five-day festival?/ There should be dialogue and sensitization,"" said Major Gen (rtd) S C N Ja tar, of city-based Nagrik Chetana Manch.""There are not many efforts taken to sensitize people about the severe impact of firecrackers. In Maharashtra, the Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti used to run a campaign against bursting firecrackers. But in recent times, there is no concentrated effort from organisations and government on this front,"" says Ashok Jadhav, a professional who feels the government must take a stand.Some nations, like China and the United Kingdom, have taken stringent steps in this regard. To cope with record smog, Beijing has emergency plans to curb air pollution. This includes a ban on fireworks when the city experiences three consecutive days of heavy smog. The city government has introduced a regulation requiring peo ple who buy five or more boxes of fireworks to register with an official ID. The city halts fireworks sales entirely if the pollution levels rise to dangerous levels. There are time and place restrictions, and all fireworks are labelled. Shanghai has reduced the city's number of authorized firework sellers after a fivefold increase in pollution levels fold during the fireworks extravaganza in 2013. The Fireworks Regula tion Act of 2004 prohibits the use of fireworks in England and Wales between 11pm and 7am, although extensions are given for special events.These regulations are strictly enforced by the police, and include fines up to \xA35,000 andor imprisonment for up to 6 months for selling or using fireworks illegally .This includes a spot fine of \xA390.TIMES VIEWEnough research has been done to prove firecrackers are hazardous to health, especially when air pollution levels in urban areas are already high. Health experts have warned of lungrelated problems after getting exposed to the smoke of crackers. The noisiest celebration of Diwali across the state was recorded in the Karve Road area last year. Many senior citizens have complained about trauma caused due to the blasting sound of crackers.Though some NGOs are campaigning in schools and even on roads promoting the idea of cracker-free Diwali, more such efforts are needed to sensitize people. Progressive nations have imposed a series of restrictions, including a cap on the sale of crackers to an individual, and imposition of fines on those bursting crackers beyond the stipulated time limit. While not everything can be left to the government, the state bodies, including the pollution control board, can make the real-time air quality data public when crackers are burst during festivities. Schools and educational institutions can use this data to educate students on the issue. Just a handful of NGOs alone will not be able to drive home the campaign for noiseless Diwali./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Activists expect pollution level to come down further,"LUDHIANA: As the air pollution in the city on Diwali has witnessed a gradual fall over the years, the organizations working for green Diwali hope that the pollution would further come down this year given the increased awareness among residents against smoke-producing crackers.As per the data of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) on pollution on Diwali day during the last few years, RSPM (respirable suspended particulate matter) witnessed a gradual decrease from 390 parts per million (ppm) in residential areas in 2012 to 148 ppm in 2015. The SO2 (sulfur dioxide) in residential areas too witnessed a fall from 30 ppm in 2012 to 12 ppm in 2015. The NOx (mono nitrogen oxides) too witnessed a decrease on Diwali day from 45 ppm in 2012 to 31ppm in 2014.There had been a fall in air pollution in commercial areas too on Diwali day. RSPM value which was 648 ppm in 2012 came down to 289 ppm in 2015. Similarly, SO2 and NOx values in commercial areas too had witnessed a fall. SO2 in such areas decreased from 24 ppm in 2012 to 18 ppm in 2015 whereas NOx decreased from 51 ppm to 40 ppm on Diwali day during the same time.The noise level for the city too has witnessed a decrease from 73.2 dB in 2011 to 69.1 dB in 2015. PPCB authorities too expressed satisfaction over the fall in the pollution on Diwali.""Though air pollution on Diwali continues to be a bit more than normal values, but it has witnessed a fall on Diwali over the last few years. /Our reports suggested that that there is decrease in the use of crackers in the city on Diwali. The credit for this goes to residents especially the ones who have created awareness about green Diwali,"" said Gulshan Rai, chief environmental engineer, Ludhiana, PPCB.The organizations which create awareness about green Diwali said there has been quite a change in people's mindset regarding crackers.""It is a great achievement for residents especially youngsters who have brought the change in attitude among the people. Instead of bursting crackers, more and more residents are switching over to green Diwali and diyas. We also have been educating youngsters to go for green Diwali,"" said Ravi Arora, founder member of Transformation of City, a group of NGOs and social groups working for city. Positive changeFrom being the most polluted city in the state, Ludhiana witnessed a positive change as the efforts of green activists have borne fruit and city has dropped down to number three in air pollution on Diwali last year. The noise levels in the city too were recorded less than Patiala, but higher than Amritsar and Jalandhar./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Cloaked in haze all year as rules to curb pollution bite the dust,"GURGAON: Residents of the city's most-sought after address face another trying winter as the dusty haze created by the twin infrastructure projects on Golf Course Road adds to pollution levels that are already in the year's worst phase. Both projects, one to upgrade Golf Course Road into a 16-lane expressway and the other the second phase of Rapid Metro, have involved large-scale excavation, demolition and construction, driving up pollution levels and creating traffic bottlenecks. And with both projects overshooting deadlines, residents say their patience is running thin. /Air quality in NCR plummets in winter but Golf Course Road is cloaked in a dusty haze all year. In that aspect, winter is a dreaded time for local residents. Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) data shows the average level of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in Gurgaon has increased from 350 \xB5g/m3 in 2015 to 415 \xB5g/m3 in 2016. The board has attributed it to construction activities in new sectors of Gurgaon. ""That is why large parts of the city remain covered in a layer of dust,"" said a senior HSPCB official. Golf Course Road's makeover has also been a contributor to this, the official added. Most construction sites in Gurgaon do not follow guidelines issued by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) and the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to check dust pollution. Unfortunately, Golf Course Road has been no different. The most elementary of the norms - covering construction material like sand or mounds of earth with sheets to prevent particles from flying - is the most widely flouted.""None of the construction sites is covered as the norms mandate,"" said Rajkumar Saini, a resident of Alaknanda society in Sector 56, abutting Golf Course Road. ""The area is filled with dust as roads are dug up and construction material on trucks is not covered. Sometimes, it is difficult to breathe."" Manoj Pandey, a resident of Sukh Shanti Apartments nearby, said a permanent haze has hung over neighbourhoods around the road for several years now since both projects took off. ""Traffic jams are rampant too. There has been no effort to mitigate that while construction is under way,"" he said. Mahesh Dayma, councillor in MCG House whose term came to an end this May, said his office was flooded with complaints from residents about pollution, but no action has been taken by any government agency. Yet, with both the new expressway and Rapid Metro corridor nearing the finish line, the situation isn't as bad this year as last year or the year before. In places where construction is still on, environmentalists say following the guidelines can reduce pollution even if they can't completely stop it in projects of this magnitude. ""There are several factors that contribute to air pollution. Dust from construction sites is a major contributor in this region,"" said environmentalist Vivek Kamboj./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Punjab says no money for technology to stop crop burning,"CHANDIGARH: There is little chance of any let-up in air pollution in Punjab and the states of Delhi and Haryana post-Diwali as Punjab has expressed its inability to provide farmers money for alternative technology, citing lack of funds.Following a rebuke from National Green Tribunal (NGT) on paddy burning last week, a cash-starved Punjab government has told the Centre that it does not have the money to implement its orders .The Delhi government released a NASA image dated October 26 showing a haze blanket across north India due to crop residue burning in Haryana and Punjab, saying it was having a major adverse effect on the city's air quality.A note sent by the Punjab government to the Centre, accessed by TOI, says, ""The finance department observes that to implement the National Green Tribunal orders of October 19, 2015, on making agricultural equipment and machinery available to all concerned farmers by the state government... the expenditure is around Rs 1,583 crore. It is difficult for the finance department to make these funds available.""It is therefore advised that the administrative department may approach the central government for providing a grant and the state can only provide nominal share if required."" The machines needed to stop paddy burning are paddy straw, chopper shredder (16,000), happy seeder (13,400), rotavator (10,000), M B Plough (11,450), rake (5,400) and baler (5,400).In 2014 and 2015, the Punjab government could provide only 14,173 rotavators, 392 happy seeders and 5086 zero till drills.The Akali Dal government is now mopping up funds by fining the farmers caught burning the stubble anything between Rs 2,500 and Rs 15,000.Despite repeated attempts, agriculture minister Tota Singh or finance minister Parminder Dhindsa were not available for comment.Congress spokesperson Sunil Jakhar says the note ex poses the Parkash Singh Badal government. /""This is an admission that they are bankrupt, and are unconcerned about the farmers' welfare or about protecting the environment"".Punjab is facing a debt of Rs 1.34 lakh crore and had recently pledged 12 state-owned properties for a loan of Rs 2,100 crore to support its subsidies and state schemes.""Burning of paddy residue causes smog and air pollution.It also poses a significant threat as it leads to breathing difficulty, allergies and asthma attacks.

Extreme Rise in Air pollution in Patna: 16 times above WHO safe limits,"PATNA: The city had witnessed 'Severe' air quality, which may cause severe respiratory and cardiac ailments to healthy person on prolonged exposure. Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) on Monday released data from the 24 hour monitoring of the ambient air quality during Pre-Diwali and Diwali days.Despite the awareness drive on 'Say No To Crackers' undertaken by the Bihar Government, the recent data for Diwali suggests that the government must issue health warnings and regulate certain sources of pollution.The data says that the ambient air quality of Patna has deteriorated alarmingly on the night of Diwali. The levels of PM 10 and PM 2.5 spiked maximum 1.4 and 3 times higher than the concentration noted during days (October 25 -29, 16) before Diwali at the same duration, said CEED programme manager Ankita Jyoti.""The concentration of particulate matter (PM 2.5) has shot up to 6.6 times above the prescribed national ambient air quality standard and 15.8 times above World Health Organization safety limits"", Jyoti who analysed the data told TOI on Monday. /Diwali is the auspicious festival of light and crackers but every year it leads to the deposition of immense amount of toxic pollutant in the atmosphere. A comprehensive and vigilant data was monitored in Patna at four different areas, namely Dak Bungalow, Patna City, Sultanganj and Bhikhna Pahari. The air quality at Dak Bungalow on the day of Diwali was noted to be the worst among all the areas.The particulate matter (PM)concentrations compared during the pre-Diwali and Diwali days within a time frame of 18:00 pm to 22:00 pm had shown an increase of 67.2% in PM 2.5 level. ""The continuous evaluation of the pollution level on Diwali indicates the air quality in severe zone and which will continue to remain in the coming two days"", Jyoti said..The general trend showed that the concentration of particulate matter started rising after 6 pm on Diwali night and reached to the worst at late night hours. The pollution level found highest in time range of 22:01 PM- 00:00 AM, while the hours during late Morning and Noon is comparatively less polluted. The data computed clearly explains how the smoke caused by fireworks completely blanketed the city by midnight, data says.Ankita Jyoti elucidates that due to the excessive use of fireworks on Diwali, a lethal cocktail of smoke is formed over Patna which remains trapped for days since the atmospheric holding capacity of pollutant has increased with stagnant wind and high humidity./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"In Delhi, air quality deteriorates to 'severe' levels on Diwali night","NEW DELHI: As predicted by pollution monitoring agencies, the air quality on Diwali (Sunday) recorded 'severe' levels. Thick smog and a smell of smoke in the air around midnight made it obvious that air quality had deteriorated drastically compared to the day and early evening before firecrackers were burst. (SAFAR PM 2.5 running average at midnight)System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting Research (SAFAR) under the ministry of earth sciences (MoES) website (monitors 8 locations) at around 12.30 am on Monday showed a running PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) average of 283 micrograms per cubic metres for the city which is more than 4 times the national standard and about eleven times the World Health Organisation (WHO) standard. /(At Anand Vihar PM 2.5 levels peaked to more than 800 micrograms per cubic metres after 1 am on Monday morning)Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) website which monitors six locations showed huge peaks in both PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels after 9 pm on most locations they monitor. For example, in RK Puram PM 2.5 concentrations peaked to 647 micrograms per cubic matter following which there was a gap in their monitoring until midnight when again levels were around 690 micrograms per cubic metres, at Anand Vihar PM 2.5 levels peaked to more than 800 micrograms per cubic metres after 1 am on Monday morning. PM 10 (coarse, pollution particles) peaked to as high as 1600 micrograms per cubic metres at Anand Vihar at around 3 am on Monday, about 1400 micrograms per cubic metres at 3 am on Monday at RK Puram, this about 28 times the WHO 24 hour guideline. The wind speed which was well over 1.50 metres per second at most locations on Sunday morning and afternoon fell to 0 or 0.3 metres per second which made it even more difficult for emissions from firecrackers to disperse. DPCC, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and SAFAR are likely to release air pollution analysis for Diwali either today or on Tuesday./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Delayed monsoon ensures dry Diwali, but air quality takes a hit","A delayed northeast monsoon not only gives jitters to the city's water managers, but can also worry those monitoring its air quality index. Rainfall reduced pollution levels last Diwali but this year, with no rain, it has gone up again. The respirable suspended particulate matter count, an indicator of air pollution, almost doubled in overcrowded neighbourhoods like Triplicane and Sowcarpet, according to data released by Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.All neighbourhoods, where air quality was surveyed, recorded pollution levels way above the permissible limit. /Besant Nagar and T Nagar recorded the lowest count of PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 micrometres in diameter) on Diwali. The two neighbourhoods recorded 102 micrograms per cubic metre and 113 micrograms per cubic metre, marginally above the permissible limit (100 micrograms per cubic metre) recommended as per the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.Apart from increasing the presence of particulate matter in the air, the explosion of crackers sent the sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions shooting up. They were, however, within the permissible limit of 80 micrograms per cubic metre. Nungambakkam and Triplicane recorded the highest SO2 and NO2 levels.Former TNPCB member-secretary K Karthikeyan attributed the drop in pollution last Diwali to rainfall. ""While the rain reduced use of firecrackers, it also helped disperse clouds of smoke that would have otherwise lingered and poisoned the air.Rain droplets helped in turning SO2 to sulphate aerosol and its subsequent dispersion,"" he said.Keeping with the high pollution levels, the number of cases of respiratory illnesses reported at city clinics and hospitals went up. Asthma specialist Dr R Sridharan reported a 50% increase in the number of patients at his clinic Mylapore. Dr Sridharan said the cases could increase in numbers and intensity in the coming weeks as the north east monsoon has set in.""There will be an increase in the fungal spores count due to humidity which builds up after rainfall. Moreover moisture-rich air keeps allergens tightly suspended in the air for a long time. This will flare up ailments leading to acute asthma, sinus and nasal allergies, apart from aggravation of skin abnormalities,"" Dr Sridharan said.The risk of respiratory infections will peak during December when the air is still and particulate matter is suspended for longer duration, he said.Noise levels this Diwali were similar to the previous two years, recording slight variations.Last year, T Nagar recorded 126 decibels (dB) noise, almost three times higher than the permissible limit (45dB). It came down to 81 dB this time. Triplicane was the loudest this Diwali where the noise level went up from 73 dB on Saturday to 88 dB on Sunday ./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution behind 1 in 10 under-5 deaths',"A report by the United Nations Children's agency , Unicef, released on Monday has confirmed the worst fears of people living in polluted areas -that bad air is contributing to death of many children even before they celebrate their fifth birthday.Outdoor and indoor pollution, the agency noted, are directly linked to respiratory diseases that account for almost one in 10 under-five deaths, making air pollution one of the leading dangers to children's health. ""Children are more susceptible than adults to air pollution as their lungs, brains and immune systems are still developing and their respiratory tracks are more permeable. Young children also breathe faster than adults, and take in more air relative to their body weight,"" Unicef stated.According to the UN agency, which used satellite imagery to assess the impact of toxic air on children, around two billion children live in areas where outdoor air pollution, caused by factors such as vehicle emissions, heavy use of fossil fuels, dust and burning of waste, exceeds minimum air quality guidelines set by the World Health Organisation.South Asia has the largest number of children living in these areas, at 620 million, with Africa following at 520 million children. /The East Asia and Pacific region has 450 million children living in areas that exceed guideline limits. The findings come a week ahead of the COP 22 in Morocco, where Unicef is calling on world leaders to take urgent action to cut air pollution.""Air pollution is a major contributing factor in the deaths of around 600,000 children under five every year \xAD and it threatens the lives and futures of millions more every day ,"" said Unicef executive director Anthony Lake. In Delhi, experts fear, the health impact of air pollution could be higher due to heavy density of particulate matter.

"What are you smoking? - Less noise, more smoke: Diwali leaves Delhi gasping for breath","The city government's anti-firecracker campaign went up in smoke on Diwali night. With just a slight dip in fireworks but more adverse weather than last year, Diwali celebrations exposed Delhiites to alarmingly high pollution levels.Early Monday saw PM 2.5 (fine pollution particles) and PM 10 (coarse particles) peaking at unbelievable levels. PM 2.5 hit 500-900 micrograms per cubic metre at some places.While CPCB recorded a slight reduction in noise levels from last Diwali, it said low wind speeds and lower mixing height this year trapped pollutants near the surface. The Delhi Pollution Control Board (DPCC), how ever, observed a slight increase in noise levels this year.RK Puram and Anand Vihar recorded PM 2.5 peaks of 748 and 883 micrograms per cubic metres at 2.30am on Monday . DPCC's analysis showed there was a jump in levels of almost all pollutants compared to last Diwali.The 24-hour PM2.5 average range for six locations monitored by DPCC was between 180 and 440 micrograms per cubic metres with minimum recorded at IGI and maximum at Anand Vihar. /This is about 7 to 17 times the WHO norms. Last year the range was 184 to 369 micrograms per cubic metres. Thus, maximum pollution levels were more than seven times the national standard of 60 micrograms per cubic metres and higher than last Diwali.There was a jump in gaseous pollutants as well. For example, 24-hour average nitrogen dioxide concentration this time ranged from 70 to 123 micrograms per cubic metres com pared to 37 to 79 last Diwali, average sulphur dioxide concentrations ranged from 20 to 131 micrograms per cubic metres compared to 26-64. Carbon monoxide levels, which are otherwise on a decline in the city , ranged between 2,000 and 4,200 microgram per cubic metres as opposed to 1,100-4,000 last year.While there was a sense among residents of certain colonies that bursting of firecrackers had reduced this year, there was just a slight reduction in noise levels.""Centre for Science and Environment has also tracked the real time air pollution data reported in the DPCC website.This shows rapid build-up of pollution after 5pm and very high peak levels during night.Calm weather with nearly no wind blocked quick dispersal of smoke and pollutants,"" an analysis by CSE said.Noise levels recorded a range of 66.1 Db (A) to 75.8 Db (A) compared to 65.9 db (A) to 74.8 db (A) last year, states DPCC.According to monitoring by SAFAR, the PM 2.5 average on Diwali Day was 302 micrograms per cubic metres com pared to 217 last Diwali. But air quality average deteriorated even further to 624 micrograms per cubic metres on October 31, which is about 10 times the national safe standard.""Major reasons for the significantly high air pollution was lower wind speed (less than 1kmhr), low temperature (about 15 degree C) and the atmospheric boundary layer (lowest part of atmosphere) falling to 40-60 metres between October 30 midnight and October 31 morning,"" said Gufran Beig, project director at SAFAR.The US Embassy's air now site, which displays data from the embassy's monitoring station at relatively clean Chanakyapuri, showed ""severe"" levels since 4pm.

A quiet Diwali sees air pollution in Bengaluru remain 'moderate',"BENGALURU: All of two years old, Ira decided to step out of her flat in an apartment complex in Yeshwantpur to go down and meet her friends, who were busy bursting crackers. However, the smoke-filled air reverberating with the cacophonous din, and the plight of the dogs and the pigeons made her averse to crackers. Ira is in the habit of keeping rice and water in her balcony for the pigeons. /Interestingly enough, her mother, Madhurima Das, a research associate at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), has not burst a cracker for more than a decade. ""We had a quiet Diwali. Neither I nor my spouse burst crackers. Also, being asthmatic doesn't help. Although the festival gets over, its effects linger for a while. But, I felt that the situation was a tad better this year,"" she said.Across Bengaluru, a large number of citizens made a conscious choice to celebrate a quiet Deepavali. Sarita Gupta, a resident of Malleswaram, said, ""We had a fabulous puja, which was attended by family and friends. We lit mud lamps and placed flowers everywhere in the house. We also wanted to brighten the lives of others and so sent food, sweets and clothes to an orphanage.""Noting a perceptible decline in the amount of crackers burst this year, Sarita added, ""We had a designated area in the building for bursting crackers. The amount of dirt there was much lesser compared to the previous years.""Concurring with the observations made by the residents, officials of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) said that pollution levels were much lesser in comparison to last year.The National Air Quality index, which provides real-time data on air pollution indicated that particulates that could travel deep into the respiratory tract were the prominent pollutants on Sunday. Exposure to these particles could lead to short-term health problems in the eye, nose, lungs and throat. While the maximum level of particulate matter touched 436g/m3 and the average was 11 g/ m3. On Sunday, the carbon-mono-oxide remained the major pollutant, touching 103g/ m3 in the morning. The average CO levels remained at 56g/ m3. Particulate matter was the main pollutant in Peenya, while the air quality index (AQI) was 199 on Saturday. It remained the same on Sunday as well. PM 2.5 levels are commonly used as the best indicator of severe air pollution, while PM 10 particles are a cause of public health concern, but less lethal.In the other air quality monitoring centres, at City Railway Station and SG Halli, particulate matter, CO and Nitrogen Dioxide were the main pollutants over the past three days./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

At Rajendra Nagar, it was recorded at 788.23g/m3 against the 167.8g/m3 of RSPM on a normal day while at Civil Lines, it was 891.28g/m3 against the 179.3g/m3. The recordings were made over a 24-hour period from 3 pm to 3 am./Speaking with TOI, Dinesh K Saxena, professor, Botany department, Bareilly College, said, “Toxic fumes from firecrackers worsen killer particles in the air that have already increased by eight times than the safe standards. They also deposit deadly chemicals in our environment that remain for days.” This harms health of not only those who suffer from respiratory and cardiac problems but even normal healthy people, he added./Noise pollution was also recorded at all time high in these areas of the city. The ambient noise level was recorded at 79 decibles on Diwali at IVRI against the 20 decibles on any normal day and at Rajendra Nagar, it was 91 decibles against 39 decibles while, the noise level at Civil Lines was recorded at 83 decibles against 45 decibles on the normal day./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Action plan: Nothing on buses, odd-even","NEW DELHI: The Delhi government on Tuesday announced an action plan to deal with the severe pollution this winter. This includes a crackdown on construction sites violating norms, reviving the Swachch Delhi app, re-starting vacuum cleaning of streets and sprinkling of water on arterial roads to tamp down the dust.Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, however, didn't mention any plan to upgrade public transport like getting buses to meet the deficit. Besides, he didn't comment on whether the odd-even strategy or any other emergency step would be implemented again when air quality worsened further. ""We will re-start vacuum cleaning of roads. /It was stopped during the monsoon. We are facing some problems in the tendering process to procure machines. For now, we will use whatever we have,"" said Sisodia.Currently, there are only two vacuum cleaners with corporations. According to officials, these machines do not function well on colony roads. A senior official said that initially, the South Corporation had outsourced the work to three private agencies, but later on, retained only two of them. ""We have two mechanical sweepers and they work during night. The problem with these machines is that they don't work properly on uneven surface and most of the roads are not well maintained,"" the official added. In 2010, the erstwhile MCD had outsourced the vacuum-cleaning of arterial roads to a private firm, which deployed 29 sweeping machines across the city. But the project failed to make any progress.Sisodia said initiatives were being taken to ensure residents can complain against the 61 construction sites (more than 20,000sq m in size), which are being monitored by the environment department. He added that people can also complain against smaller construction projects through an app. The Swachch Delhi app may be re-launched for this purpose. The government will penalise officials who are not able to check waste burning in their areas. The superintending officers of various parks will be challaned if there is any waste burning in parks while sanitary inspectors will be fined if this menace is detected on roads.""We will to reduce emissions from the cremation grounds as well. Since a large number of people use wood for cremation, a lot of emissions come from crematoriums. We plan to get chimneys installed so that smoke can be tapped. This will be done in coordination with municipal corporations,"" Sisodia added. Other measures to tackle air pollution include sprinkling of water on certain roads as well as installing mist fountains and air purifiers at five major intersections.But the government didn't announce any timeline for these actions to be taken. Experts say the government's focus should be on combustion sources such as vehicles and waste burning since emissions from these are the highest in winter while road dust is a significant polluter in summer. ""What about controlling emissions from vehicles? Where is the initiative for public transport? Emissions from the Badarpur power plant also needs to be addressed. They need to issue health advisories and determine how they will tackle pollution peaking episodes. They also need to monitor impact of their actions on air quality and calibrate action accordingly,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of CSE's clean air campaign.The government announced these measures following a high-level meeting, which was attended by health minister Satyendar Jain, environment minister Imran Hussain, chief secretary K K Sharma and senior officials from PWD, DPCC, DJB and the environment department./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
One in every ten child dies of air pollution,"Outdoor and indoor pollution, the agency noted, are directly linked to respiratory diseases that account for almost one in 10 under-five deaths, making air pollution one of the leading dangers to children's health.

Simple ways to purify your indoor air,"Nine out of 10 people globally are breathing poor quality air. Yet, oblivious to the dangers of indoor pollution, when we speak of pollution we only refer to outdoor pollution. Jayati Singh, Business Head, Air, Philips India adds, ""Indoor air is 3-5 times more polluted than the outdoor air because it is a mix of outdoor pollution that comes in through windows and doors as well as indoor pollutants like dust, cooking fumes, allergens, incense, cigarette smoke and pet dander.""According to a recent survey conducted by Artemis Hospital under the Clean Air India Movement, due to unhealthy indoor air quality, about 31 per cent of the survey respondents had some kind of airway disease and 46 per cent people were found to have symptoms suggesting a respiratory disease.Dr Amol Kumar, Pulmonologist, from iCliniq says, ""Indoor air pollution is wreaking havoc on the sleeping patterns of people, thus leading to multiple ailments. /The right home air purifier can help us sleep better and prevent sinus and breathing problems as it will remove dust and allergens from the air and leave us breathing easier and even reduce snoring.""Here are some easy ways to prevent your indoor air from getting worse: Monitor indoor pollutionYou can download a pollution mapping mobile application to monitor air inside your house. Also, keep your windows and doors closed in the wee hours and early morning, as that is the time when pollution is at its worst.Use chimney to filter cooking fumesResearchers have established that cooking fumes are cancerous and contribute greatly to contaminating indoor air. While cooking, always keep the exhaust fan on (and use chimney). Also, it is important to clean grease traps on regular intervals. Avoid smoking indoorsSmoking is a big health hazard and it can permeate into your environment. So it's best to avoid smoking indoors and you are also advised to wash your hands and face after smoking.Keep air-purifying plantsHouseplants can help you purify indoor air. They absorb particulates in the air and then process it into oxygen via photosynthesis. Plants like chrysanthemum (Garden mum), spider plant, weeping fig and peace lily are some of the indoor plants you can consider keeping at your home.Change bed linen regularlyChange your bed sheet and pillow covers at least twice a week and always use clean blankets. Regularly washing curtains is also a healthy practice to prevent indoor air pollution. Avoid moisture from getting trappedClean your house well and prevent moisture since dust and mites strive on moisture. High moisture inside the house leads to mold growth and is also associated with respiratory issues. Use exhaust fan while cooking and even in the bathroom after shower; put the clothes' dryer outside, don't put too much water in houseplants and make sure there are no leaky plumbing to prevent mold. Get your electronic devices, especially air conditioners serviced regularly and use dehumidifier./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Health ministry's plan to focus on lung disorder,"NEW DELHI: The Union health ministry will soon release, what is being called the ""New Delhi declaration on mitigating effects of air pollution"". This will offer a time-bound action plan to different ministries to address various sources of air pollution. The health ministry has also decided to include chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD)-a health condition closely associated with exposure to toxic air-in the non-communicable diseases (NCD) programme.It has recently held a meeting with the steering committee constituted to look into air pollution. The panel released a report in August last year and had been discussing the need to include COPD in NCD programme since then but the ministry finally took the decision to include it only last month. /""All states have been asked to include COPD in the NCD programme. The issue will also be discussed with all BRICS nations during our meetings on November 17 and 18 because all these nations are affected by this problem,"" said Dr Damodar Bachani, deputy commissioner (non-communicable diseases) at the health ministry. This would mean that along with diabetes, cancer, hypertension and others, NCD clinics will start screening people for COPD too from now on. ""All clinics will have spirometers that can measure the lung capacity. Assistance will be provided to make nebulizers, bronchodilators and relevant antibiotics available. We always knew that COPD was the second largest killer after heart disease in the NCD category. Our decision to include it was triggered by the steering committee report on air pollution,"" Dr Bachani added.Experts have hailed this move. ""Declaring COPD as part of non-communicable diseases gives a message to policy makers to take action on environmental factors as well as lifestyle, which would also mean promoting walking and cycling,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of CSE's clean air programme.Representatives of various ministries agreed to release the pollution declaration, which will focus on preventing health problems. ""The fundamental message emerging out of the newly available data is that premature death and disease can be prevented through healthier environments,"" a concept note by the health ministry says. A senior official said that the action plan might be released this week since air pollution levels were already very high.""The declaration will have several points, including the supply of cleaner fuels to urban slums and rural areas, which are dependent on biomass burning and reducing exposure of vulnerable people to bad air in the early morning and evening hours,"" added the official./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Health ministry to release declaration on mitigating impacts of air pollution,"NEW DELHI: The union health ministry will soon be releasing a ""New Delhi declaration on mitigating effects of air pollution"" which will give time bound action points to other ministries to address various sources of air pollution related to their ministry.The health ministry recently held a meeting with the steering committee on air pollution which had released a report on air pollution and health impacts in August last year. The health ministry has also decided to include chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), a health condition closely associated with exposure to severe air pollution, under the non-communicable diseases (NCD) programme. All states have been asked to include COPD under NCD. ""COPD will also be discussed with all BRICS nations in our meeting on NCD on November 17 and 18 because all these nations are affected,"" said Dr Damodar Bachani, deputy commissioner (non-communicable diseases) at the health ministry.The steering committee meeting attended by representatives of all ministries agreed to release the declaration which will focus on preventing air pollution related health impacts. /""Over 6 lakh deaths and about 18 million disability adjusted life years are attributable to air pollution in India...the fundamental message emerging out of the newly available data is that premature death and disease can be prevented through healthier environments,"" a concept note by the health ministry read. ""Most ministries participated and agreed on the action points put forth by the steering committee. Now these points have to be cleared by the secretary, health before we release the declaration.We may release it this week since air pollution levels are very high already,"" said a senior official.The steering committee on air pollution was formed in 2014 and is chaired by Dr K Srinath Reddy, President of Public Health Foundation of India, Ambuj Sagar, IIT Delhi professor and Kirk Smith, professor of Global Environment Health, University of California, Berkeley. The committee's work is being coordinated by Dr Damodar Bachani, deputy commissioner (non-communicable diseases) at the health ministry.""The declaration will have several points. But the top three are to target and curb every source of air pollution, supply of cleaner fuels to urban slums and rural areas that are dependent on biomass burning, reducing exposure of vulnerable persons by avoiding early morning and evening hours when air quality is very poor,"" added the official.The steering committee's 2015 report also focused on reducing exposure to air pollution. It collated evidence on health impacts from outdoor and indoor air pollution and suggested measures for each source of pollution like-vehicles, biomass burning, diesel generator sets, road and construction dust, brick kilns, industries and power plants. Since the committee's mandate is health, it also stresses on monitoring exposure of individuals rather than depending on the ambient air quality data. The recommendations of the steering committee were accepted by the health ministry last year following which the report was circulated to rest of ministries and their comments were sought. ""We have received comments from most ministries. This is the first time that air pollution is being dealt with through health policy,"" explained the official.Recommendations that will be immediately rolled out are to campaign against certain kinds of Diwali crackers, LPG supply to slums, reliable power supply to slums, an health advisory for the vulnerable population (pregnant women, children below five years, elders above 60 and those who are sick). ""If FM radio can tell you which roads to avoid due to traffic, it can also tell you the air quality in different parts of the city. We are urging that data dissemination is more transparent so that people can reduce their exposure to toxic air. We are also considering developing an health advisory,"" the official added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Bhubaneswar witnesses less pollution this Diwali,"BHUBANESWAR: Even as images of a smog-filled Delhi did the rounds, this year Odisha's capital city witnessed a dip in air pollution in the aftermath of the Diwali celebrations. The air pollution reading taken on Sunday by the Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB) showed a significant decrease as against last year.The pollution panel has installed six pollution monitoring devices at Patrapada, IRC village, OSPCB office at Nayapalli, Capital police station, Rasulgarh and OSPCB laboratory at Chandrasekharpur to monitor pollution on a regular basis. Pollution board sources said last year in Diwali, the particulate matter (PM-10) in ambient air was as high as 700 micrograms per metre cube. /But this year it has been found to be 324 micrograms per metre cube in IRC village area. The pollution panel felt due to reduction in the sale of Chinese crackers, which emanates more smoke, the ambient air pollution has come down. ""Although the ambient air quality continued to be beyond the permissible limit, this Diwali it is far less compared to the previous year,"" said OSPCB regional officer (Bhubaneswar), Hadibandhu Panigrahi. During last year's Diwali, air pollution (PM-10) near OSPCB office (Nayapalli) was found to be 511 micrograms per metre cube while this year it was 190. The ambient air this year was found to meet the standard parameter at OSPCB regional laboratory with the monitoring device recording PM-10 as 100 micrograms per metre cube. Last year, it was 274. The noise level this Diwali was also comparatively less as it was found to be in the region of 80 decibels compared to 85 last year. On normal days it remains between 65 and 70 decibels, which is on the higher side. In September, the pollution panel had issued an advisory to the Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) to submit a plan of action to check air pollution.The pollution panel had said in its letter that BDA should prevent parking of vehicles in non-designated areas to check concentration of vehicular emission. It had also asked the BDA to plan de-congesting the roads. ""The suspension and suppression of dust on the roads is an important factor that has to be taken into account to minimize air pollution. For this, the open spaces in the city will have to be turned into a green canopy,"" said an OSPCB officer./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air, noise pollution only a tad higher this Diwali","TRICHY: The city witnessed a slight increase in air and noise pollution levels on the night of Diwali compared to the previous year.The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) had installed air quality monitors at three places in the city. Air quality is monitored in terms of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5) count and SO2 and NO2 levels in the air.Woraiyur recorded the highest PM 10 in the city at 154 micrograms per cubic metre against the national permissible limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre. Gandhi market was not far behind with 115 micrograms per cubic metre followed by Bishop Heber College at 71 micrograms per cubic metre. /However, the level of SO2 and NO2 were well within the limits in the city. Officials attributed the rise in pollution to the lack of rain this Diwali, unlike last year. Experts said that a person exposed to such suspended particulates could face respiratory diseases, asthma and wheezing. They said that elders and children were more vulnerable to dust and air pollution which affects their lungs resulting in respiratory problems. Dust reduces the capacity of lungs to inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. In terms of noise pollution, the city recorded 82.3 decibels noise compared to 81.2 decibels last year. The permissible limit of noise level in residential areas is 55 and 45 decibels during the day and the night respectively. The TNPCB had installed sound level meter at Thillai Nagar in the city. Founder of Voice Trust A Gregory said that while western countries have largely shunned high decibel crackers during festivals, things have not changed in India. Planting of trees will help in stopping dust particles from entering the house and also bring down the amount of particles in the air./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution highest since 2013 this Diwali,"PUNE: Air pollution in the city during Diwali festivities was at its worst this year since 2013, scientists at System for Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said on Wednesday after an analysis. They also found the air quality index high on October 30, 31 and November 1, the main days of the festival.A study for the period between 2013 and 2016 shows that there was maximum emission of smoke from the use of fire crackers on Laxmi Puja day and a day after. /This year, a nip in the air added to the pollution.If the air quality index is between 201-300, it is categorized as poor and if it is between 301-400, it is considered very poor, indicating health risks for people sensitive to air pollution. This year, it was 192 and fell under the moderate level, but was the highest since 2013. ""Pune's air quality levels have ranged from moderate to very poor during Diwali. However, it is expected to improve over the next three days with a rise in the minimum temperatures,'' SAFAR's senior programme officer Neha Parkhi said. A dip in minimum temperatures, low wind speed and emissions from fire crackers on Diwali day has pushed up the air quality index, an indicator to measure pollution levels.The PM 2.5 and PM 10 (coarser particles) levels for Mumbai were also on the higher side touching 145.9 as against 60 microgrammes per cubic meter./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Diwali revelry: Varanasi choked, sky covered with smog","VARANASI: The temple city's air pollution levels reached alarming levels following the celebrations on the day after Diwali, and enveloped the city in a thick cover of smog. As per the figures revealed by Care4Air, a campaign by Whistle Blower Trust, the level of particulate matter in the air on Monday was 15-20 times more than the level set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Talking to reporters on Wednesday, chief campaigner of Care4Air, Ekta Shekhar said ""Pollution levels were monitored with the help of a real time monitoring mechanism at as many as 13 places across the city, the morning after Diwali. The air quality was found highly toxic and has triggered concerns about public health. /The device was jointly prepared by IndiaSpend and experts of IIT-Kanpur.""As per their monitoring mechanism, the ultra pollutant, PM 2.5 (particles that measure less than 2.5 microns in diameter), breached the standard by over 20 times at Sonarpura crossing. The levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10 were recorded to be 990 and 687.9 micrograms per cubic metres respectively. The prescribed standard for PM 2.5 is 60 while for PM 10, which is slightly bigger than PM 2.5 but very harmful for the respiratory system, is 100. Burning of firecrackers and burning of waste in open air were held responsible for the rise in air pollution in Varanasi.Many other areas including the densely populated Godowlia crossing and Lanka had nearly similar readings between 6-10am on October 31 morning, when vehicular pollution was minimal. Shekhar said, ""According to CPCB's findings, air pollution was marginally higher than last year as PM 2.5 and PM 10 ranged between 380 micrograms per cubic metre and 341 micrograms per cubic metre, while last year (November 12, 2015), it was recorded at 305 and 256 micrograms per cubic metre respectively"".""On Monday morning, Varanasi woke up to a highly polluted air, as smoke from Diwali fireworks, coupled with moisture and nearly stagnant wind movement, shrouded the city in a thick cover of smog at a time when the vehicular emission was minimal,"" she said, adding that air samples at tourist places like Sarnath, too, was alarmingly high with PM 2.5 and 10 being recorded at 463 and 419 micrograms per cubic metre respectively while Chowk area recorded lowest pollution levels. City-based pulmonologist and physician, Dr. RN Vajpayee, said ""Prolonged exposure to PM 2.5 and PM 10 can harm the respiratory system as the ultra fine particulates can find their way deep into the lungs and also enter the bloodstream"".

Gurgaon: You can't see and you can't breathe,"GURGAON: The city was blanketed in thick smog on a grey, brooding Wednesday that saw pollution levels reach nearly 14 times the safe standard. An overcast sky added to the general gloominess with visibility so poor that it completely engulfed the city's impressive skyline and buildings as little as 200 metres away went beyond a cloak of haze. Concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 touched the 800 mark in the afternoon, which was almost 14 times higher the national safe standard. The average 24-hour level of PM 2.5 (measured between 4pm on Tuesday and 4pm on Wednesday) was 423.62 micrograms per cubic metre (\xB5g/m\xB3), still seven times higher than the safe standard of 60. According to officials at the Met department, the situation is going to get worse in the coming days. /""If it doesn't rain or wind speed doesn't increase, the situation is likely to get worse. Better sunshine can also make a difference. It is expected that sunshine will be a little better on Sunday onwards,"" said an official of Met department.According to the data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), concentration of PM2.5 has constantly increased since Diwali (October 31). While the 24-hour average concentration of PM2.5 was 212.96\xB5g/m\xB3 on October 30 (from 2pm on October 29 to 2pm on October 30), it increased to 217.45\xB5g/m\xB3 on October 31. The level further rose to 328.15\xB5g/m\xB3 on November 1 and reached 381.50\xB5g/m\xB3 on November 2. As per WHO, concentration of PM2.5 shouldn't be more than 60\xB5g/m\xB3.However, other air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and ozone remained below the prescribed limit. While Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) blamed rise in air pollution in Delhi for conditions in Millennium City, experts said the authorities have not taken enough measures to deal with the problem, primarily by not being able to check stubble burning at farms.""There are emergency measures which authorities should have taken after Gurgaon and its neighbouring cities reported an increase in concentration of PM2.5. These could have included closing down polluting industries for 15-20 days, reducing vehicular traffic in the city, making changes in school timings and issuing precautionary advice to children, the elderly and pregnant women,"" said Niranjan Raje, a former member of the expert appraisal committee at the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change, and a member of Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA).""If you look at the average PM2.5 concentration in Gurgaon on October 30 and 31, it was below 250\xB5g/m\xB3. However, the level was much higher in Delhi. The level is increasing in Gurgaon since October 31. It indicates that particulate matter has travelled from Delhi to Gurgaon,"" said an HSPCB official.Refuting that claim, professor Sushil Dayal, a city-based environmental scientist, said, ""Wind speed is already very low. It is unlikely that particulate matter could travel so easily. Like Delhi, Gurgaon too reported a rise in air pollution owing to burning of firecrackers, along with stubble burning.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Diwali air over north India was world's worst,"Over the Diwali weekend of 2016, India’s air quality was among the world’s worst and between 40% and 100% worse in five north Indian cities than at the same time the preceding year, according to global air pollution data and an IndiaSpend analysis of national data and our #Breathe network of sensors./On October 30 and 31, 2016, from 9 pm to the wee hours of the next morning, North India–especially parts of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar–recorded PM 2.5 levels of over 500 µg/m³–exhibiting “beyond scale” pollution values, according to the database run by Berkeley Earth, an independent US research organisation./PM 2.5 is fine particulate matter about 30 times finer than a human hair. These particles can be inhaled deep into the lungs, causing heart attacks, strokes, lung cancer and respiratory diseases, and are known to pose the greatest risk to human health. Their measurement is considered to be the best indicator of the level of health risks from air pollution, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)./For this analysis, IndiaSpend compared 2016 Diwali air-quality data (October 23 to November 1) from our #Breathe monitors–in Lucknow, Agra and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Patna in Bihar, and two locations in Delhi–with air-pollution data recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in similar locations over the same Diwali period (November 4 to 13) in 2015./South Delhi’s 24-hour average PM 2.5 levels in 2016 were 38% higher than on Diwali night 2015. The next day, these levels were twice as high as the day after Diwali in 2015, crossing 650 µg/m³, 26 times above the WHO’s guideline levels, or levels considered safe. On the morning of November 1, 2016, citizens in Delhi woke up to an average PM 2.5 level of over 700 µg/m³–some of the highest levels recorded the world over and 29 times above WHO standards./The WHO guideline for 24-hour average PM 2.5 levels is 25 µg/m³. With an annual average PM 2.5 level of 122 µg/m³, Delhi’s air is the worst among global megacities with dense populations, as IndiaSpend reported in October 2016 based on WHO data./The CPCB sensors were located within a 5-km radius of our #Breathe. We observed that for the week ending October 30, 2016, PM 2.5 levels recorded by the CPCB monitors were lower than those recorded by #Breathe sensors in many instances. This variance could be attributed to the difference in location and other local climatic factors. However, the trends of variation in PM 2.5 levels over the week are similar, as the graph below indicates./Away from the national capital region, Patna recorded a 24-hour average PM 2.5 level of 437.3 µg/m³– nearly 95% higher than the levels recorded last year (224.9 µg/m³) and 17 times above WHO guideline levels. In Varanasi, while Diwali day itself recorded a 40% higher average of PM 2.5 at 247.1 µg/m³, the next day’s levels continued to soar to an average of 578.6 µg/m³, 23 times above WHO guideline levels. Agra recorded rising pollution levels progressively up to the morning of November 1, 2016, more than double the values recorded last year. Lucknow recorded a 37% increase in PM 2.5 levels in 2016 over 2015./Air before Diwali 2016 was cleaner than in 2015, then it deteriorated, swiftly/The escalation in pollution levels this year was swifter and sharper, according to our analysis./On October 23, 2016–one week before Diwali–Varanasi recorded a 24-hour average PM 2.5 level of 96 µg/m³, nearly half the level recorded last year. Similarly, average pollution levels in Agra and the Delhi were 38% and 30% lower, respectively, than those recorded on the corresponding day in 2015 (November 4, 2015). Lucknow was 11% less polluted this year, while only Patna recorded 38% higher levels, compared to November 4, 2015./Lower wind speeds and a shorter vertical mixing layer–the height at which air turbulence can disperse pollutants–caused particulate matter to remain trapped near the surface level, according to the CPCB. With the festival arriving earlier this year, the recorded mean wind speed was 61% lower. Last year, Diwali night also registered a mean mixing height twice as high./“The level of pollutants has increased significantly in all places irrespective of parameters attributed to unfavorable meteorological conditions during the entire period,” the CPCB said in this report./By Alison Saldanha & Karthik Madhavapeddi/(By IndiaSpend.org, a data-driven, non-profit and public interest journalism platform with whom Alison Saldanha is an assistant editor and Karthik Madhavapeddi is a desk editor.)/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Delhi chokes on worst Nov smog in many years,"NEW DELHI: Delhiites woke up to apocalyptic grey skies as a heavy smog hung over the city on Wednesday, reducing visibility to its lowest for the month of November in many years. The air quality was so poor that it was comparable to the post-Di wali spike in pollution. The air quality index for 4pm on November 2 was 432, in the ""severe"" category, while the index on October 31 (the day after Diwali) was 445.The Met office said visibility at the IGI Airport was in the range of 300-500m -on a par with dense-fog days in December and January which was the worst the city has witnessed in November in many years. /An official said Wednesday's visibility was poorer than in November 2012, when the city had the worst smog (for the month) in recent years.The smog thickened by nightfall and at 9pm, visibility at IGI had dropped to 250m. Experts called for an ""emgency response"" as the air ergency response"" as the air quality has been in ""severe"" or ""very poor"" levels for more than a week now. On Wednesday , PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) concentrations peaked to ""dangerous"" levels in the morning. PM 2.5 levels crossed highs of more than 700 micrograms per cubic metres at various lo cations such as R K Puram, Punjabi Bagh and Anand Vihar on Wednesday morning after 7.30 am. The PM 10 (coarse pollution particles) levels peaked to 1,600 micrograms per cubic metres at these locations and remained higher than 1,000 micrograms per cubic metres for most of the day.Scientists at air quality monitoring agencies said the very high levels of pollution were due to the cumulative impact of crop residue burning in neighbouring states and pollutants emitted on Diwali. ""Look at the largescale crop stubble burning in Punjab. NASA images show smoke has spread all over the region. The pollutants cannot disperse because of the calm conditions,"" said a scientist from DPCC.""The crop fires have been going on for weeks now. Also, the firecrackers burst on Diwali are still hanging in the air. There is no immediate intervention to address this. We need the government to take emergency action now. How else will the levels come down?"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury from the Centre for Science and Environment.Some scientists in pollution monitoring agencies even suggested that primary schools should be closed so that children are not exposed to such high pollution levels.In Beijing, as part of their four-tier pollution alarm system, this kind of severe air pollution on three consecutive days would result in a ""red alert"", where schools and kindergartens are closed, power plants directed to cut emissions, car use regulated according to number plates (restrictions similar to odd-even). SAFAR under MoES on its website said when firecracker emissions were about to dissipate, wind direction on November 1 evening became north-westerly for a few hours before settling down to north-easterly./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Sadly, despite Gurgaon having to deal with a thicker smog than neighbouring Delhi, one can still spot polluting vehicles on its roads. In fact, many of these vehicles have been flouting norms, being well past their age limits.According to National Green Tribunal (NGT) orders, petrol vehicles older than 15 years and diesel vehicles older than 10 years (as on February 29, 2016) should not be allowed to ply in the NCR. /The deadline to de-register old vehicles from Gurgaon RTA was set for October 31. On Friday, it was extended to November 15. This applies to vehicles registered under series HR55, HR55A, HR55B, HR55C, HR55D.Afterwards, no objection certificates were issued by the RTA to 8,000 vehicles with All India Tourist Permits, so that they could be registered outside NCR. That still leaves at least 50,000 vehicles in Gurgaon which need to be phased out, revealed sources in the RTA. The process of cancelling registration of these vehicles will start from November 16. Most of these are autos, private cabs and goods carriers. Regular checks are being carried out on trucks, buses and other heavy vehicles by the RTA. In fact, over 400 buses have been impounded and challaned by the officials this year. Due to this, transporters no longer send older heavy vehicles out on NCR routes. As a result, public transport is a headache for authorities and increasingly becoming a health hazard for residents due to the harmful fumes they emit.In Gurgaon, around 10,000 diesel cabs have exceeded their age limit set by NGT. In addition, there are over 15,000 diesel-run shared autos, which can be seen on the roads emitting thick black smoke while ferrying passengers. However, there is no clampdown on them yet. The deadline is over, but RTA officials are still preparing a list of vehicles that are older than the NGT age limit. A senior RTA official told TOI ""this list will be completed only by early next week, when it will be submitted to NGT"".Unfortunately, so far traffic police is challaning and impounding vehicles only during enforcement drives. Sources revealed a comprehensive programme, that includes challaning, impounding and notifying RTA, needs Authority approval to be carried out by police. After de-registration, the RTA is to issue a public notice and supply a list of such vehicles to traffic cops, who will then take appropriate steps as per NGT directions. ""Once we get the information from the RTA, we'll take all necessary steps as per law,"" said joint commissioner of police, Y Puran Kumar.But with officials busy in paperwork, residents continue to breathe poison.Experts believe while Diwali crackers are burst once a year and stubble burning is carried out periodically, vehicular emission is a 24x7 year-round issue. ""The diesel smoke include respirable particles which gets into the lungs. They are carcinogenic and cause deadly diseases. So we can't ignore the threat,"" said environmentalist Niranjan Raje./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Demand for air purifier in Delhi-NCR perks up by 50% post Diwali: Assocham survey,"MANGALURU: Air purifier market in India has seen a spike of about 50% in its demand in wake of poor air quality in Delhi-NCR post-Diwali, noted a quick ASSOCHAM survey.The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) conducted a survey to gauge the hike in demand for air purifying kits across 200 electronic and general stores in Delhi-NCR in past four days.""There has been an explosion in demand for air purifiers which has jumped nearly 50 per cent as air quality in and around Delhi has become hazardous post-Diwali festival,"" said majority of electronic and general stores' representatives selling such items.""The demand for air purifier in India has been growing rapidly across metros in India but as the smog problem became severe in Delhi after Diwali the demand for such kits has become really huge and is likely to grow steadily,"" said many of the store managers.However, many of these said that people looking to install air purifiers in their homes get disappointed owing to high costs and term it more of a luxury product. As such most of such customers are only enquiring and their number is growing by the day.The demand is more from offices, industrial and commercial establishments, said many of these.As per market experts, the air purifier market in India is still in nascent stage and is estimated at about Rs 250 crore but has been growing by leaps and bounds since past one year owing to rising awareness about impact of air pollution.""The national capital has been facing problem of haze for quite some time, pollution, allergens and firecrackers together have further caused significant deterioration in Delhi's air quality,"" said D S Rawat, secretary general of ASSOCHAM while releasing the findings of the chamber's survey.""All these factors together with growth in infrastructure development activities, growing sales of automobiles, urabnisation and industrialisation provide a lucrative market for air purifiers to enhance overall quality of air in commercial, industrial as well as residential settings across the region,"" said Rawat.""Demand for air purifier installations is likely to grow exponentially as they become popular and would be installed in shopping complexes, malls, offices and homes and almost everywhere, more so as health problems like asthma and other lung related diseases are also growing rapidly,"" he added.""Significant rise in per capita disposable income of consumers is also likely to drive air purifier sales,"" further said Mr Rawat./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"NGT slams Centre, Delhi govt for not taking adequate measures to tackle pollution","NEW DELHI: The National Green Tribunal on Friday slammed the centre and Delhi government for not taking adequate steps to tackle air pollution problem in the capital, the result being the current conditions, the worst in 17 years. Criticizing the Union and state government for indulging in a blame game, the bench headed by NGT chairperson Swatanter Kumar said, ""For you, the people of Delhi do not matter. Just look at what we are giving our children for the future. /This is terrible"".The green bench reiterated its direction to Delhi government to stop diesel vehicles over 10 years old from plying in the capital and wondered why there was no compliance on the order. However, the Delhi government counsel told the tribunal while challans were indeed being issued, the authorities did not have adequate space to park impounded vehicles.When the counsel added that stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan was also a reason why the pollution was so high at the moment, the bench retorted, ""Crop burning is not the sole reason. There is no wind nowadays, so the smoke and pollutants are not coming from those states.""The panel was infuriated that no action plan had been drafted to be discussed at a meeting on Thursday of Delhi's chief secretary, Central Pollution Control Board and the ministry of environment and forests. NGT has now summoned the environment secretaries of Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab, UP and Haryana to present an action plan on November 8, when the panel next meets.""We understand there is a conflict of administration among the civic agencies, Delhi government and the Centre, but you can tell us who is not doing his work,"" said the bench.""It is unfair to the people of Delhi. The authorities are just throwing up their hands. We have to do something. You cannot say that time will do it.""The bench also highlighted the issue of waste burning, saying they were receiving numerous complaints from people, along with photographs showing leaves and municipal trash being burnt in the open. ""There are other sources of pollution like dust, burning of leaves and construction waste.Why are you not taking any steps? Mounds of waste are being burnt at landfill sites and this alone is enough to kill the people of Delhi,"" the bench observed, while hearing a petition filed by scientist Mahendra Pandey through advocate Gaurav Bansal on the high incidence of dengue and chikungunya in the capital./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Planting hope of clean air,"NEW DELHI: Delhi's severe air quality is a cause for concern. Globally, bad air has been confirmed as a leading cause of heart diseases, and the World Health Organization attributes more than 6 lakh deaths nationally to foul air every year. While countering this bane requires addressing every source of emission in and outside the city, we plan to develop city forests inthe capital that can help sequester air pollutants in future years.Along with Hero MotoCorp and Delhi Development Authority (DDA), TOI will undertake plantations at Tughlaqabad Biodiversity Park, Tilpat valley and Neela Hauz.TOI ran a month-long plantation campaign called the TOI Green Drive with Hero MotoCorp and DDA in August last year when more than a lakh saplings were planted in Tilpat Valley Biodiversity Park near the Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary and in other areas such as Bakoli village, Sidhola village, Vishal Bagh to Ghoga crossing, Sector 28 Rohini, Sector 28-II also in Rohini in north Delhi and at Sanjay Lake, Sector 16, Dwarka and District Park Kalkaji in south Delhi.The Hero TOI Green Drive will take place at Tughlaqabad Biodiversity Park on November 5, Tilpat valley on November 6 and Neela Hauz on November 11. ""The plantation drive will be similar to what we did last year at Tilpat valley, with only native Aravali species being planted to recreate the original biodiversity of this region. /About 10,000 saplings will be planted at Neela Hauz and 30,000 in Tughlaqabad,"" said CR Babu, professor emeritus, DU, and head of the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE), which is executing the biodiversity park projects for DDA.The idea is to improve the city's green cover to help address air pollution, bring back birds and animals that have disappeared from the city, improve and revive native biodiversity in a highly degraded area like the Tilpat valley, which is a part of Delhi Ridge, and counter the urban heat island effects where certain areas record higher temperature than other parts due to excessive concretisation. More than 40,000 people turned up at Tilpat valley on August 30 to plant over 1 lakh saplings. Volunteers from 40 NGOs under the Teach India programme, 2,800 NIE school students and 16 spiritual organisations representing all religions participated.Tilpat valley is already on its way to recovery now. A carpet of native grass now covers the land. More than 85% of the saplings planted not only survived, but have grown to a height of 1-3 metres. The plantation drive at Tilpat valley was planned meticulously to replicate native forests of the Aravali.The biodiversity park will start providing ecological benefits to the city in 10 years when the canopy height reaches around 25 feet./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
