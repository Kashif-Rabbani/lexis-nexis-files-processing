"Indoor air pollution 10 times more harmful, say experts","Chennai: Indoor air pollution (IAP) is ten times more harmful than outdoor air pollution but more attention is given to the latter, participants from leading technology and research institutions said while discussing indoor air quality management in tropical climatic conditions on Friday.""Toxins remain trapped inside an enclosed room, depending on the ventilation, which make it worse. Factors causing IAP lead to release and accumulation of pollutants like formaldehyde, radon, asbestos, heavy metals, tobacco smoke, and those released by burning of cooking fuel and biomass,"" said Dr Chitra of Madras Medical College.She said even though LPG causes lower pollution than the burning of biomass it is not safe. ""It is slightly better. /Also, IAP depends not only on what is being burnt but also the way cooking is done,"" she added.The summit on air quality management saw the participation of scientists and leading professionals from IIT Madras, State and Central Pollution Control Board, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute and private companies in the technology sector. Issues affecting air quality in urban and rural settings were discussed.""The problem in urban settings is the dearth of open spaces. Another problem is the shortage of green cover which, to a large extent, reduces the toxins in the air,"" said Dr R Sivacoumar, principal scientist at CSIR-NEERI.He emphasised that while choosing residential spaces, one must ensure that the floor space index (FSI) is not more than 1.5.

"Nerul residents complain of rise in air pollution, MPCB to look into issue","NAVI MUMBAI: Residents of Nerul, along Dr. D Y Patil Marg, Sector 13, have been complaining of pollution issues. Due to this, residents are forced to keep their windows shut all through the day. Some locals have even complained to environmentalist D Stalin about this. ""I visited the place and was surprised to see black soot like film on the walls, curtains and flooring of flats. /This could be caused possibly due to the nearby MIDC TTC industrial zone or the quarries. This is a serious issue and needs to be reported to the Navi Mumbai office of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) since it concerns the health of the citizens in Nerul,"" said Stalin.When TOI visited the affected areas, one resident said, ""The MIDC industrial units are barely a kilometer away from the main Sion-Panvel Road. Sometimes we can see black smoke emanating from the industrial chimneys. That is why we try to keep our windows shut all the time to avoid breathing this pollution.""Meanwhile, MPCB regional official P Wankhede in-charge of the Nerul area said, ""The MIDC TTC industrial zone in Nerul has been there for over three decades while the residential complexes came up much later. However, if there is any pollution problem we will look into it and also send out notices if required.""According to another MPCB official, the quarries seen beyond the MIDC TTC zone are currently inactive as they were earlier ordered to shutdown. However, since there is hardly any 'buffer zone' between the industrial region and the residential colonies, locals are likely to face some problems due to poor localized air quality index. ""Between the MIDC industrial units and residential complexes there is just the main Sion-Panvel road. So that can hardly be termed as a buffer zone. Also, while the quarries are reportedly inactive, some of the locals have said that they can hea r distant sounds of blasts from the quarry sites. Hence that too needs to be investigated,"" said Stalin.Nerul-based activist Anarjit Chauhan said, ""Under Article 47 of the Constitution of India, the state is duty bound to raise the standard of living and public health of its people. So, if in the past notices have been issued to the polluting units by MPCB then the authority must eventually shut down such units if they continue to belch out pollutants in the air.""

"Focus on indoor air too, study claims it could be far worse","NEW DELHI: You might be aware about the pollution levels outside, but do you know that the indoor air you inhale might be far worse? Track the pollution level in your city A study by the environmental studies department of Delhi University shows that poor ventilation and structural designs can trap volatile organic compounds (VOCs), bioaerosols and particulate matter inside that can lead to various health ailments, including acute respiratory illnesses and impairment of lung function.The nearly five year-long research, conducted on 900 people across several households of varied income groups, pointed out that the high and low level groups were most vulnerable to respiratory diseases due to the lifestyle and design flaw of their houses.Chirashree Ghosh, associate professor, DU environmental science department, said it is difficult to measure the actual impact of indoor air pollution owing to an absence of indoor air policy in the country.""The study aims to bust the myth that the air quality indoors is safe. In fact, it could be even worse because the outside pollutants gets trapped inside. /In addition, there are several pollutants and sources indoors that can cause pollution levels to rise gradually, unless there is proper ventilation,"" Ghosh told TOI.The research found that most houses had high volatile organic compounds - dust, radon, CO2 and high concentration of bioaerosols (organisms or dust that consists of pathogens, viruses, fungi, allergens and pollen).Poor ventilation was the primary source of indoor air pollution. ""Using any form of spray or room freshener releases high amount of volatile organic compounds in the air, which stays for several weeks without proper ventilation. VOCs are carcinogenic and can cause long-term damage to people,"" said Ghosh.The study found that in low-income households, the pollution levels were highest around evening when cooking begins and family members return home. For higher income households, mornings and nights were most polluted, Ghosh said, adding that the poor indoor air quality can lead to increased instances of chronic bronchitis, acute respiratory illnesses and impairment of lung function, among other hazards.The next phase of the study would focus on household structures within DU to analyse different sources of indoor pollution and components according to seasons. ""The ministry of earth sciences has asked us to find the source and solution to the problem. We will look at five different types of structures within DU and analyse the architectural component and design that may be causing the problem,"" said Ghosh. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Report sought on maintenance of govt buses,"Madurai: Non-maintenance of the state-run Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (Madurai) buses is resulting in unwanted smoke emanating from the vehicles and thus impacting the environment and public, a petition filed before the Madras high court Madurai bench has said.To this, a division bench headed by justice M Sathyanarayanan on Friday directed the additional secretary, home (transport) department to file a report before it on March 19, pertaining to steps taken to prevent air pollution caused by vehicles.The petitioner, V R Vickram from Madurai said that in Madurai 1,116 buses are in operation, for which 84,000 lt of diesel is required per day. Of those buses, many are not maintained properly. /The condition of air buses, introduced in the city in April 2010 seems to be affected the most. When the engines release a thick black smoke, it should be understood that there is some problem. The transport corporation is supposed to set them right, but is not doing it. Proper maintenance of buses will also help save fuel. Interestingly, the petitioner sought information regarding the maintenance of buses under the RTI, for which the general manager replied that maintenance takes place everyday. Seeking to maintain buses properly, the petitioner sent a representation to the managing director of TNSTC (Madurai) on January 13 and 24 this year. But, there was no action on their part.

Holika Dahan worsens city's air quality index,"Nagpur: After being ""moderately clean"" for last few weeks, the city's air quality slipped to poor level on the day of Holi, thanks to the 'Holika Dahan' fires that were burned on the previous evening. Air pollution in the city saw a significant increase on Thursday and Friday with particulate matter (PM) 2.5 rising almost five to six times more than the permissible limit of 60 microgram per cubic metre (mpcm). On the intervening night of March 1 and 2, the prominent pollutant PM2.5 entered the danger zone and was recorded 329 mpcm. Post midnight, its value spiked to 396 mpcm and kept fluctuating between 390 and 300 mpcm till about 8am on the festive day. /It was only at noon that the PM2.5 levels came under moderate levels. PM 2.5 is an atmospheric particulate matter of diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. It can easily enter the circulatory system and cause chronic diseases and respiratory problems.Due to the increase in PM2.5 levels, the overall air quality of the city deteriorated drastically. The pollutant measuring indicator air quality index (AQI), on March 1, was recorded 103 which falls under 'moderate' category. The next day, the AQI shot up to 231, bringing the city's air quality under 'poor' category. According to environmentalists, Holika Dahan bonfires have turned into a trash burning exercise. ""This time, we saw many people burning all kinds of waste including tyres, tubes and polythene bags in the name of bonfires. This not only increases the concentration of particulate matter but also emits hazardous gases like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere. Burning of wood also generates nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds which is very harmful for human health,"" said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of NGO Green Vigil Foudnation. Community celebrations can help in reducing the quantum of air pollution. ""It makes no sense in having bonfires in every lane. Instead, people living in the area should gather and organize a common bonfire. Also, burning any kind of waste should be avoided. If needed, alternate options like cow dung should be used for the fires,"" added Chatterjee. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Strict building norms to curb air pollution,"Panaji: In an effort to tackle air pollution in towns and cities, the central government has set out to ensure that dust mitigation measures for construction and demolition activities are compulsorily implemented. The measures apply to projects that require environmental clearances (EC). The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) on January 25 issued and notified amended rules, called the Environment (Protection) Amendment Rules 2018, seeking to lay down guidelines for mandatory implementation of dust mitigation measures.""Big projects with a built-up area of more than 20,000 sqm, such as government projects, private housing projects and others requiring EC will have to comply with the guidelines laid down by the MoEFCC,"" an official said. This suggests that promoters of all such buildings or infrastructure projects will be required to provide an environmental management plan, inclusive of dust mitigation measures, before they receive approval.As per the new serial number 107 that has been inserted in the Environment (Protection) Rules 1986, grinding and cutting of building materials in open areas will not be allowed. /It also stipulates that construction material and waste has to be deposited only within a earmarked area and that any storage of such materials by the roadside will be prohibited. Transportation of construction material and waste in an open vehicle will also be prohibited.""A construction and demolition waste processing and disposal site shall be identified and required dust mitigation measures shall be notified at the site,"" the provisions in the amended rules state.The new serial numbers 106 and 107 apply to cities and towns where the value of PM10 and PM2.5 exceed the prescribed limits in national ambient air quality standards. Essentially, PM10 denotes particulate matter that is 10 micrometres or less in diameter, while PM2.5 represents matter that is 2.5 micrometres or less in diameter. A breach in PM10 and PM2.5 limits could affect respiration in healthy people and could have serious impacts on those already afflicted with lung and heart disease.The Goa State Pollution Control Board monitors ambient air quality in Panaji, Vasco, Assonora, Amona, Bicholim, Honda, Codli, Curchorem, Kundaim, Mapusa, Margao, Ponda, Sanguem, and Tilamol (Quepem). Its annual reports indicate that the value of PM10 has exceeded the prescribed limit in some instances. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Kolkata mayor tables Rs 127 crore deficit budget, focuses on infra development","KOLKATA: Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee on Saturday placed an Rs 127 crore deficit budget of Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) for the financial year 2018-19 in which he put infrastructure development as the top priority. From introducing 24-hour water supply in selected city areas to making Kolkata a 'zero waste' and 'no flooding' city, the promises made by the mayor are galore. This apart, the KMC will also focus on curbing air pollution in the city. /However, the focus will be on strengthening city's infrastructure, conceded city's mayor. Among such projects, water supply will be placed on the top of the civic body's endeavor. Embarrassed by the recent outbreak of enteric diseases in city's eight wards which include large areas off Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, Jadavpur, Dhakuria and Santoshpur, the KMC water supply department has decided to augment the capacity of Jai Hind Water Treatment Plant at Dhapa and to build a water booster pumping station within the plant area to supply more filtered water to the these areas where more than four thousand people were affected by the outbreak of diarrhea. The civic body has already taken up several projects to eliminate use of ground water in different parts of the city. Keeping in view different areas in Tollygunge where people still depend on ground water a water pipeline has been laid from James Long Sarani via New Alipore Road and Deshapran Sashmal Road intersection for transmitting water to Ranikuthi and Layelka booster pumping stations.Another work of laying of 72"" diameter transmission main project by trenchless technology from Garden Reach Water Works through James long Sarani is nearing completion. ""Once this project is complete, residents of Tollygunge will get more filtered water and won't have to depend on tube-wells,"" said a KMC water supply department official. The civic body water supply department has undertaken a massive augmentation project at Garden Reach water treatment plant to ban use of ground water in large parts of south Kolkata. Similarly, the KMC will try to introduce a 12-hour uninterrupted water supply in Cossipore-Dum Dum area which will later be upgraded to 24/7 water supply.Similarly, one of the civic body's ambitious projects will be in the field of cleaning up the city. The KMC aims at making city's major thoroughfares no waste zones. ""We will install thousands of bins alongside all major roads for use of shop owners and pedestrians. Around 6000 such bins have already been installed across the city to prevent littering on roads,"" said a KMC official. In order to modernise primary garbage collection system, the KMC has procured 100 battery-operated hydraulic dumpers which will be deployed in different wards. In addition to these measures, the KMC has plans to set up more compactor stations in next one year. The city already has 76 such stations.The KMC sewerage and drainage department has decided to take more help of machine driven equipment and advanced technologies for desilting of city's clogged sewer lines. Machine driven equipment like automated gully pit emptier, jetting machines, suction machines, blow-vac machines will be purchased in large numbers to free waterlogging-prone areas from flooding, said a KMC official said.

Major fire breaks out at scrap godown near Icchapore,"SURAT: A major fire erupted in a scrap godown near Icchapore on Hajira road on Tuesday afternoon. The godown in an open space near Iccapore was full of tyre and other scrape. /The reason for the fire was not unknown and even the ownership of the godown was unclear. Sources say that scrape belongs to a multinational company located on Hajira road. After the fire broke out at around 2.30 pm on Tuesday, thick black smoke covered the sky which could be seen from areas like Vesu and Surat-Dumas road about 10km away. ""The godown had a pile of waste material like tyre scape and as a result huge black smoke was emanating from it. There was no loss of life or injury,"" said Vasant Parikh, fire officer, Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) fire department. It took five hours to douse the fire. Two fire tenders form SMC, one from nearby KRIBHCO plant and one from Reliance are pressed into service. ""We are finding it very difficult to douse the fire due to lack of water. There is no source of water nearby so water is being brought form KRIBHCO plant,"" said Parikh. ""The fire created a lot of air pollution for the people living in the area. Until tyres or material that is present there is burnt completely, it would continue to emanate black smoke,"" said ST Dhobi, a fire official. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Smoke testing units in TNSTC to be checked,"Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court, which heard a case pertaining to stop air pollution caused by public transport vehicles appointed an advocate commissioner to check whether the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) (Madurai region) has smoke testing units.The division bench headed by justice M Sathyanarayanan gave this direction on Monday on a batch of cases.The petitioners told the court that the state-run TNSTC (Madurai) is not maintaining its buses properly. Due to poor maintenance, unwanted smoke is coming out from buses while they are plying, ultimately affecting the environment and causing health hazards to the people.The transport corporation is supposed to set them right, but did not do it. Proper maintenance of buses will not only help to save fuel, but people also. When the corporation was asked about maintenance of buses under the RTI, its general manager replied that maintenance of buses was taking place daily. But, it was not true, the court was told.

Breathing city's toxic air is like smoking: Doctors,"KOLKATA: Leading doctors from various hospitals have pressed the alarm bell on Kolkata's toxic air and warned it had turned so fatal that it warranted health emergency.""The air has become so bad that breathing it is as good as smoking cigarettes. Air pollution is a key factor that causes respiratory diseases and lung cancer,"" Narayana Super Specialist Hospital clinical director and chief of radiation oncology Suman Mallik said at news meet on Thursday. It was organised by Kolkata Clean Air, an umbrella organization of environment activist groups in the city.This is the first time doctors have openly held the city's poor air quality responsible for the high mortality rate and ailments among non-smoker and teetotaller patients.While Kolkata's air quality is often compared to that of Delhi-considered one of the most polluted cities in the world-pulmonoligist and respiratory physicist at Fortis Raja Dhar said it was meaningless as 28 automated air quality monitoring stations functioned in Delhi, providing a clear picture of the city's ambient air quality, while the only two stations that Kolkata had did not even function. /""Citizens' health issue has been severely compromised. People have a right to know how foul is the air that they are breathing,"" said Ajay Mittal of Kolkata Clean Air.Kolkata has earned the notoriety of being the India's lung cancer capital. As many as 70% citizens suffer from respiratory disorders due to air pollution. Besides, there are cases of haematological abnormalities, impaired liver function, genetic changes and neuro-behavioral problems. According to Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and National Centre for Atmospheric Research, air pollution has reduced life expectancy of Kolkatans by 6.1years, second to Delhi's decline by 6.4 years.Arup Halder, consultant pulmonologist at Colombia Asia and Woodlands Hospital, wondered why the city so patiently accepted the grave situation without even a murmur of protest. ""Do we really care for our kids? If we do, how can we allow them to breathe poison every minute?"" he said.Air pollution can change the genetic expression of the next generation by epigenetic mechanism, cautioned Prakash Kumar Hazra, cardiologist at AMRI. ""Air pollution is playing havoc on our health and the ecosystem,"" he said.Besides respiratory diseases, such as COPD, air pollution leads to interstitial lung disease and increases the risk of cancer in lungs, head and neck, bladder and blood.

Better traffic management will reduce pollution: Experts,"Hundreds of vehicles caught for several minutes in every signal and traffic bottleneck pollute the air by spewing smoke. Better traffic management and redesigning of road may reduce this air pollution in the city, said experts. If a seamless traffic is ensured, effectively reducing the time taken by a vehicle to reach the destination, air pollution will come down.""A ride from Thudiyalur to Gandhipuram, which took 15 minutes earlier, now takes 90 minutes during the peak hours. /The Kavundampalayam junction, which has immensely developed with various markets, shops, temples and restaurants, is no more a suburb but almost a part of the city. The road near the signal also narrows adding only more to the traffic snarls,"" said Ramesh R, a commuter. M Anandhi, a flower vendor on the street, said the situation was pathetic during rain. ""Half the road will be covered with potholes and waterlogged,"" she said.Various international surveys have pointed out that commuters spend 2% of their travel time at signals and the amount of particulate matter released at the signals is 30% more than the regular travel. Road design, junction design and road maintenance play a crucial role in traffic congestion which in turn leads to pollution.Calling for better traffic management, industrialists and residents have urged urban planners to come up with ways to ensure travel time is reduced. ""Cities like London and New Delhi are coming up with various measures to reduce pollution. We are much ahead of them in that aspect. We should learn from their mistakes,"" said an industrialist.Senior programme manager, south India, ITDP, Ashwathy Dilip said, ""Traffic signals synchronization was done in New Delhi to reduce air pollution. It will definitely help to a certain extent. But it is not a long term solution. We need other modes of transportation. No matter how well our roads are designed or traffic signals are placed, the number of two wheelers and four wheelers will continue to grow. We need to increase good quality public transport."" Apart from this, environmentalists also called for planting of more trees in junctions. Yoganathan, a bus conductor and environmentalist, said: ""There are several fabrication industries on the Kavundampalayam-Thudiyalur Road. Before the road expansion, the trees used to absorb the pollution. Several trees were cut down for development. Also, the agricultural lands have been converted into real estate in the last 10 years."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Crossing Kavundampalayam & Ukkadam can leave you gasping,"Put on your masks when you cross Kavundampalayam and Ukkadam junctions in the city as they are the most polluted areas in the city, as per data from the Coimbatore Corporation's air pollution monitoring devices. The city corporation set up smart air quality monitoring meters in 30 locations in June, 2017. While Ukkadam is a mix of commercial and residential areas and grew in population over the years, Kavundampalayam is a quaint suburb that developed rapidly in the past 10 years. With various industries also located in Kavundampalayam, the carbon-monoxide levels were at an average of 54.6ppm (parts per million) and particulate matter at 50.3 ppm. At Ukkadam, the levels were 55.2 and 47.9 respectively. /According to the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, Kavundampalayam has always remained the most polluted area in the city during Diwali festivals. Ganapathy, Thudiyalur, Gandhipuram and Sarvanampatti are the other polluted areas in the city.At Kavundampalayam or Ukkadam junctions, every 10 minutes, hundreds of vehicles zip past spewing black smoke. Pollutants from the kitchens of the newly set up bakeries, restaurants and small and medium industries add to the woes. At Ukkadam junction, where three major markets, a bus stand and a toll plaza are located, there is no distinction between peak and non-peak hours anymore.Even the least polluted locations in the city as per the meters were highly polluted as per the central government and World Health Organization norms. As per standards, the CO levels should not exceed 8.73ppm but the least polluted area in Coimbatore is Podanur which is three times polluted than the required standards.Associate professor of department of environmental management, Bharathidasan University, R Mohanraj said he had also conducted various pollution studies in the city. ""One of the major causes of carbon monoxide levels in the air is vehicular pollution. And particulate matter increases due to the pollution from industries, restaurants, bakeries and construction activities,"" he said.Dinesh Manickam, executive of citysenze.in, who monitors the pollution levels, said that they plan to come up with devices that will provide a count of vehicles at major junctions in the city. ""We have realized that the pollution levels have only been increasing by the day,"" he said.Scientific officer at TNPCB Suresh said that they had also noted alarming levels of pollution at various occasions. ""Somehow, due to dilution, the effect of pollution is lesser in Coimbatore. The industries need to modernize their technology and measures should be taken to phase out older vehicles from the city,"" he said. Mohanraj said that the city of London is also taking steps to reduce pollution and we should learn from their model. ""Stringent measures such as congestion tax, pollution certificate for vehicles and public awareness have resulted in making their air cleaner. We can also do the same if people are aware that they will be affected by their actions,"" he said.Corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan said air quality monitoring metres were set up in 30 prominent locations to create a database so that adaptation and mitigation activities can be planned accordingly. ""This data will help us set up more non-motorized corridor and green spaces. We can also implement regulations to check if there are major polluters in these areas. At Kavundampalayam, we will assess and plan some projects. But in Ukkadam, non-motorized corridor, green spaces and other projects have already been planned to reduce pollution,"" he said.

Heart ailment risk doubles with exposure to polluted air,"Air pollution is being increasingly recognised to be a major risk factor for various cardiovascular disorders including heart attack, heart failure, stroke, arrhythmia etc. Doctors say that air pollution also increases the risk of respiratory diseases and worsens the situation in a pre-existing respiratory disease like bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive airway disease. In a recent study, it has been found that even spikes in air pollution can aggravate heart risk as much as sustained exposure. Senior interventional cardiologist Dr Nilesh Gautam and cardiac-electrophysiologist Dr Santosh Kumar Dora give us a lowdown on the various aspects of pollution and cardiovascular diseases.Rampant air pollutionAir pollution is mainly due to increased concentration of particulate matters lesser than 2.5 micron and 10 micron, increased concentration of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone etc, say experts. Various sources of the air pollution are heavy vehicular traffic, industrial units, forest fire etc. Pollution can come from traffic, factories, power generation, wildfires or even cooking with a wood stove. One of the most common indoor sources is smoking - a danger to the person lighting up and to those nearby.Short-term effects of air pollutionAcute short-term effects of air pollution are seen in elderly individuals who are already struggling with heart disease. An individual with heart blocks or having fatty deposits on the inner lining of the arteries, experiences immediate trouble when pollutants play a role in causing plaque in a blood vessel to rupture, leading to a heart attack.Pollution and cardiovascular disordersStudies have shown increases in deaths and hospitalisations when there are high concentrations of air pollutants. /Pollution leads to inflammatory effects on the blood vessels and heart, causing chronic cardiovascular problems.Pollution particles which are smaller than 2.5 microns, which are usually related to fuel combustion are most toxic and cause irritation of the lungs and blood vessels around the heart.Short-term exposure can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, arrhythmias and heart failure. The risk of death is greater from long-term exposure. It also may play a role in high blood pressure and diabetes.The various gaseous toxins and PM2.5 pollutants can easily pass to the alveoli and diffuse into blood. These toxins can lead to endothelium damage and increased fat deposit in the arteries of heart. These toxins also can cause plaque rupture leading to heart attack and stroke.Spikes of air pollution suddenly increase the blood toxin levels. This in turn lead to plaque rupture and heart attack or stroke. This may lead to arrhythmia, a heart rate disorder, which can be sometimes fatal.Working of the heart is affected by air pollution spikesBreathing polluted air causes an increase in the blood levels of stress hormones. Thus long-term exposure to pollution is associated with heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and a shorter life span.Patient's levels of the stress hormones like cortisol, cortisone, epinephrine and norepinephrine have been shown to rise with increase in levels of air pollutants causing an increase in levels of blood sugar, fatty acids and lipids. This caused higher blood pressure, a worse response to insulin, and an increase in markers of molecular stress on body tissues - all of which can, over time, increase the risk for heart disease, diabetes and other problems.Dealing with air pollutionTrying our best to reduce the sources of air pollution is the least we can do. Here are a few things we must keep in mind...Make sure that residential units are far from highways and industrial areas.Public transport should be maximised, which helps reduce vehicle density on the roads.We should avoid outdoor exercises on the bad air quality days. Nowadays air quality index is available in many cities and we should try to use that to time our outdoor exercise activities.Sensitive groups such as elderly people, children, people who already suffer from cardiac disease and respiratory diseases should avoid excessive outdoor activities, if the air quality is poor.Wear masks. Consult your doctor; seek medical attention immediately for any breathing disorders.Identify the risks in your area, where there is more exposure to air pollutants.Avoid jobs with high exposures to pollutants.Remain indoors during severe pollution.Avoid situations where you are exposed to a high level of air pollution.

Mirror check: Your roads are clean. What about your lungs?,"The sight of clean roads may make you want to laud the efforts of the civic body's sanitation workers. But before that, take a look at the sides of the road. Chances are you may find a heap of ash in some corner. That is what remains of the pile of waste the sanitation workers swept off the roads. /The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation may have banned burning of garbage, but that has not stopped its own workers from doing so. Mirror Check across the city revealed blatant violation of garbage disposal norms. At many places in the city, burning remains the major method of garbage disposal. Displaying complete nonchalance towards health hazards due to poisonous fumes and oblivious to the norms laid down by the civic body, the workers make piles of waste, including dry leaves, plastic, rubber and paper among other things, on the roadside and set them on fire. Air pollution is a major concern, but not the only one arising out of such a practice. There are chances of accidents as well even due to smouldering fires on the roadsides. Last week, an airport shuttle bus had caught fire near Karnavati Club on SG Highway. Read Also Environmentally racist? As per a primary report, the cause of the accident was the garbage bile burning near the parked bus. AMC has issued a circular with clear instructions to its sanitation workers to collect dry and wet garbage and dispose of it in a proper manner instead of burning. Unfortunately, its instructions more often than not fall on deaf ears. Parivar society, Bodakdev Geeta and her husband clean the road near Parivar Society, Bodakdev. When the Mirror team visited the place, she had gathered dry waste, including leaves and plastics, on the side of the road. Her husband came and set the pile and another one nearby on fire. When questioned, Geeta said that since they did not have a container, her husband had to burn the garbage. Her husband intervened and said that they were not the only ones to burn garbage and there were others who too did the same. They then hurriedly left from the spot. Bhaikaka road, Thaltej Mirror found another female sanitation worker, Bela, collecting garbage and burning it all on the roadside. On being questioned, she said she has no any idea about the ban on burning dry garbage. However, she immediately rushed to put off the fire. A local trader said, ""She is not the only one to burn garbage. There is another worker here who too does the same."" Bopal approach road When Mirror reached the spot, Jyoti, who is tasked with cleaning the road, was setting two piles of garbage on fire. ""My family members have been doing this work for a long time,"" she told Mirror. Claiming ignorance of any rule by AMC, she said, ""We all set the garbage, comprising dry leaves and other stuff, on fire."" Vikramanagar, Iskcon crossroads A sanitation worker had gathered a large pile of waste on the roadside and set it on fire but as soon as he saw Mirror reporters and the lensman approaching, he fled the scene. ""I have often explained to sanitation workers, especially in morning, that burning waste cause severe air pollution, but in vain,"" said a tea-stall owner who operates in the area. Mirror found another spot with burnt waste, cleaned by the same sanitation worker. Manekbaug crossroads Burnt waste was lying on the roadside near Manekbaug crossroads when Mirror reached the spot. A local trader said that it was a regular practice in the area. SOME NAMES CHANGED Little awareness about ill-effects Talking about the health hazards due to burning of smoke, Hitesh Patel, critical care specialist and pulmonologist in Thaltej, said, ""The smoke from burning of garbage can result in lung infection and allergies. The allergies are as bad as smoking cigarette. If plastic is burnt along with dry waste, it produces carbon monoxide which can lead to death if inhaled from aclose distance."" Advocate Asha Thakkar said, ""I regularly go for morning walks in and around Anandnagar. Many a time, I have seen sanitation workers and teastall owners burning waste on the roadside."" Environmentalist Mahesh Pandya said, ""The National Green Tribunal has completely banned burning of dry waste, yet government and local people continue to do so as they are not aware of its hazards. I have found several government employees burning waste regularly in Vanchetna in Vastrapur area. We informed the authorities, but nothing happened."" He added, ""We will set up a Green Catalyst team of 30 youths from various colleges of Ahmedabad. The team will survey the areas where sanitation workers set garbage on fire. We will take pictures of the spots and attach them with letters to environment department of central and state governments."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"India, China account for over half of global deaths due to air pollution","NEW DELHI: A US-study has estimated that India and China together account for more than half of global deaths due to air pollution. The US-based Health Effects Institute's State of Global Air study, released in Boston on Tuesday, has also found that increasing exposure to air pollution combined with an ageing population has led to India rivalling China in health burden from bad air. The report states that China's PM2.5 pollution levels have started stabilising and people's exposure to particulate pollution has also started declining but it's on a steep rise in India. /The death rate (deaths per lakh), however, is seeing a declining trend in both the countries. In 1990, China saw 146 air pollution-related deaths per lakh of its population. This decreased to 80 for 2016. India on the other hand saw a steady decline in death rate between 1990 and 2010, when it fell from 150 to 123. The rate, however, has marginally increased in six years between 2010 and 2016 - the year for which the latest data is available. ""Although China experienced substantial increases in population-weighted exposures (PM 2.5) before 2010 - reflecting in part the dramatic scale of economic development in recent decades - since then the exposures have stabilised...,"" the report states. The burden of non-communicable diseases among the ageing population is increasing in developing countries. For example, among those of 70 years of age or older, PM2.5-attributable ischemic heart disease alone accounted for 16.2% of life years lost due to disease or what medical experts call disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in China, 17.8% in India and more than 20% in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East in 2016. The report further states that Indian and China could be experiencing a ""double burden"" due to combined exposure to outdoor air pollution and household air pollution. In 2016, a total of 2.45 billion people (33.7% of the global population) were exposed to household air pollution. ""India and China - with 43% and 30% of their populations, respectively, using solid fuels -had the largest numbers of people exposed to household air pollution in 2016: 560 million in India and 416 million in China,"" the report reads. ""Impact and benefits of action are showing up in health indicators in China. Scale and stringency of action have certainly made a difference,"" Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said in reaction to the study. The report acknowledges that the Indian government has begun taking action to improve air quality. But it says India needs to take aggressive action on reducing emissions from household biomass combustion, coal burning and dust pollution. Overall, the report stated that seven billion people - more than 95 per cent of the world's population - live in areas with unhealthy air. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Clean up, Or the environment will clean us out!","What will happen to Chennai's topography 10 years hence? Will we lose our green cover? Will the sea level rise and submerge Chennai? What about pollution? Agriculture and environment? Experts paint a bleak picture, unless we take up cudgels and do something drastic to save the city... with some even hinting at the possible introduction of oxygen cylinder stations, on the lines of bus stops, in the city by 2028, to let us breathe in the required amount of oxygen to survive... loss of flora and fauna, and more... But our agriculturists are looking ahead, hoping 2028 would bring more technology into this sector. /The future is going to be bleak, unless we commit to changeSays environmentalist Nityanand Jayaraman, ""I am not talking only about environment. It is not a standalone issue. Environment cuts across various aspects that decide whether or not life can be sustained in the city. I don't know if 10 years is enough to kill the city, but at least, there will be irreversible damage if things go as it is now. If the second scenario is where things are little more aggressive, well, in another 10 years, we will have a dead city. What I mean is, economy would have collapsed, and instead of planned downsizing of the city, we'll have a crash downsizing. By doing what we have been doing in a more aggressive way, which is what we're planning to do with the expanded Chennai city, the city would have ended its life as a dynamic place and economic powerhouse even before that nightmare of expanded city becomes a reality. The third one is the good-news scenario, where we develop a commitment and do something to heal the environment, especially by reducing the inflow of people into the city and making other places of Tamil Nadu attractive as places of habitation, work, etc. Also, we need to have defined policies on solid waste management, sewage, water harvesting/conservation and zero tolerance to encroachments of waterbodies and coastal areas. In that case, we will be able to repair most of the damage and move towards being a pretty cool city.""We will have to use oxygen stations To a great extent, the reason for many fatal diseases these days is because of the lack of oxygen. So, what we need is enough green cover for good oxygen supply, says green crusader, K Abdul Ghani. ""Any city needs to have 33.3% green cover. But Chennai has only 6% green cover. A decade from now, if things continue to be the same, the city's green cover would have depleted further. We'd have come to a stage where we will have to use oxygen stations just like how people are using in China these days; we will have to pay for oxygen, too. Now, we're fighting for water, soon we will be fighting for fresh air. And what's next stage of drought? It's acid rain. That's impending.""Chennai will become a global modelDue to recent natural calamities, everybody in Chennai is aware of what nature is capable of. So, there's a lot of positive energy in Chennai about how we can participate to resurrect the city from its current environmental mire, says Arun Krishnamurthy, founder, Environmentalist Foundation of India. ""But the question is, will Chennai translate its positive energy into action? If it does, we will be the water capital of the world in 10 years. We're a city of three rivers, 300-plus lakes, a large marshland and a fine coast. There's no other city with such water intensity. What Chennai does with her experience and knowledge to safeguard its water resources can become a global model. And if we don't do it, then, too, we would have become a model for other cities. So, what happens in Chennai in the next decade will have a global impact.""We would have optimised waste water management Professor Sudhir Chella Rajan, Project Scientist at Indo-German Centre for Sustainability (IGCS) who also teaches Department of Humanities and Social Sciences at IIT Madras says, ""Chennai would have integrated transport planning with land-use planning. Existing and new areas of the city would have been built around high density, diversity of land-uses and destination accessibility involving plenty of opportunity for using non-motorised modes such as walking and cycling, while vastly improving the efficiency and scope of bus infrastructure while expanding other public transit networks such as the Metro and BRTS, he says, and adds, ""Water and wastewater management would have improved through the expanded use of decentralised neighbourhood-scale technologies that emphasise the usage of recycled water, and we would be generating value from waste, using low levels of energy. And hopefully, we would have in place, land-use planning and management strategies for expanding biodiversity regions, maintaining water bodies, protecting the shoreline and river channels.""We would have an all-inclusive wildlife policyWildlife researchers, however, do not see a bright future for the city. ""I don't want to be pessimistic about the scenario 10 years from now. But we have already lost quite a few species; several others have been displaced. Fresh water aquatic fauna are the most threatened, especially, the fauna of our rivers. We have so little information on them, that we do not know how much we have lost,"" says Hopeland P, wildlife researcher and consultant. He adds, ""We would have hopefully drawn up a plan to safe keep wildlife and encourage more private entities like apartment complexes, community blocks and corporates to work in this direction.""People's attitude would have changedD Suresh, popularly known as Solar Suresh, tells us, ""Awareness has been increasing, but that hasn't translated into implementation and execution. In the next decade I hope to see people's attitude change, even though I don't expect to see a dramatic change, I do expect all of us, the government and the people, to find a solution."" ""I have done about 20 biogas installations, 40 solar installations, 15 terrace kitchen gardens out of 3,000 enquiries. The government should also step in to give helping hands by creating awareness, giving recognition to people who are involved into this,"" he adds.We will go back to the villagesAthher Ahmed, former IT professional and founder of Chennai Urban Farms, a trending Facebook page, opines, ""I am very positive about it; grow your own food would have caught on as a concept in the next decade. And agriculture would see revolutionary changes - I see drone playing an important role in soil and field analysis, planting systems, decreasing costs by 85 per cent. Drones can also be used for crop monitoring and assessment of crop health, aid disease management and yield."" He also adds that a decade later, he is sees more and more people moving back to the villages and adapting to agriculture. ""Today people visit their farm houses on weekends and holidays, but it is going to reverse a decade later, apartments in cities will become a place to visit on weekends and farmhouses will be places to live in.""Pollution control measures would be in placeThe main contribution to air pollution comes from the increasing number of personal vehicles, say the officials from the Pollution Control Board (PCB). ""We can generate more awareness, provide better public transport so that people use public transportation, and also maintain the health of their personal vehicles,"" says a PCB official. ""But air-pollution will be minimised, because we are contemplating strict measures. We are also in talks to ban vehicles that are more than 15 years old,"" he adds.WISH LIST FOR THE FUTUREChinmayi, singerReclaim Adyar River and stop dumping garbage into itIncrease the green cover of the cityInstall solar panels in every apartmentLead a lifestyle that's gentle on the environmentReclaim our lakes and remove encroachments from the Pallikaranai marshlandDig compost pits in apartments /<a href=""mailto:-Ashish.Joseph1@timesgroup.com"">-Ashish.Joseph1@timesgroup.com</a>/ and /<a href=""mailto:Purnima.Sah@timesgroup.com"">Purnima.Sah@timesgroup.com</a>/ For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Drive to curb respiratory diseases in Haryana kicks off,"GURUGRAM: Governor Kaptan Singh Solanki launched the 'Healthy Lung, Healthy Haryana' initiative in the city on Saturday, which aims to reduce respiratory diseases in the state. Under the initiative, around 200 respiratory physicians from across the state formed Haryana Chest Forum to create awareness about respiratory diseases.Haryana ranks fourth in the nationwide respiratory mortality rate from chronic respiratory diseases, with around 30,000 deaths a year, doctors said. Around 2.5 lakh people were affected with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2016. The most common cause is ou tdoor air pollution, followed by indoor air pollution, tobacco smoking and occupational exposure. The forum aims to create awareness about the adverse impact of smoking in all forms, including bidi and hukka. Meetings and awareness programmes will be held at all district headquarters. It aims to evaluate the lung health of 10 lakh people in the state. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Twin forest fires reported in 2 days,"Navi Mumbai: Two major forest fires were reported in Kharghar and Belapur, ironically within 48 hours of the Earth Day celebrations. While the first fire was observed atop Kharghar hill on Monday, the second fire broke out on Tuesday evening at Parsik Hills in Belapur CBD.Fire brigade personnel from CBD fire station were rushed to the site after calls from a few citizens. /""It took almost two hours for the flames to be put off since there was a lot of dry grass on the hill slope,"" said a duty officer at CBD fire station.""The smoke of the latest Parsik Hill fire could be seen beyond Nerul. It is terrible how and why these fires happen as it is causing a lot of air pollution,"" said activist Anarjit Chauhan.In the past one month, several forest fires have been reported in various parts of Khargar and Panvel. Forest officials have also stated that since most of them are seen at great heights it becomes difficult to control them.Environmentalists and officials have noted that most of the forest fires are caused due to human activities. Raigad-based deputy conservator of forests, Maneesh Kumar, said: ""If any local leaves behind a lit cigarette inside the forest, the flames are only seen after a few hours. Hence it becomes difficult to nab the culprits. Also, some tribals believe that if they burn the dry grass on the forest hills, there will be a better crop harvest for their animals then next year."" Meanwhile, citizens are advised to call up the state forest helpline number, 1926, if they see a forest fire in their localities. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Poor air quality gives rise to respiratory ailments',"Nashik: A section of the city-based pulmonologists have blamed the declining quality of air pollution for the increase in respiratory diseases among the people living in the city.They have advocated that the concerned authorities take firm steps to improve the quality of air. According to Samir Chandratre, a doctor, there has been an increase in the number of patients suffering from respiratory problems in the city. ""Air pollution is a major contributing factor for ailments like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD),"" said Chandratre. /While COPD is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs, ILD refers to a broad range of progressive lung disorders characterized by inflammation and scarring of the lungs.""Cases of people suffering from COPD and ILD are on the rise in the city. And in many cases ILD could be fatal,"" he added. Apart from the air pollution, smoking and use of chemicals are major contributors for lung ailments. He added that he has been examining more patients having respiratory diseases at present than it was few years back. ""There is a need to tackle the problem of air pollution in the city. We must ensure that the people get the right kind of air to breathe. Or else respiratory diseases would continue to rise,"" he warned. Chandratre suggested that there should be strict vigil on erring industries in different sectors that pollute the air by not adhering to the pollution norms. Echoing similar views another pulmonologist Ravindra Shinde, said poor air quality can aggravate the problems of having history of respiratory problems. ""There are several cases where city patients suffering from COPD have to be admitted in hospitals for treatment as their condition had worsened due to poor air quality. There is a need to have proper air quality in the city,"" stressed Shinde. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Haze in air: Maharashtra tops states with most number of polluted cities,"NAGPUR: The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has sounded the death knell for 94 cities in the country where pollution levels are not meeting the set standards. Topping the chart is Maharashtra with 17 cities and Uttar Pradesh with 15 cities. The board has pinned the blame on civic bodies for ""not sharing responsibilities"" to curb air pollution.""If civic bodies can provide clean water, why can't they provide air,"" CPCB questioned, while referring to the list of 94 cities and districts that was tabled in the Parliament earlier this month. /Speaking exclusively to TOI, Dipankar Saha, additional director, head of Air Laboratory and Air Quality at CPCB analysed the data of cities which crossed dangerous PM10 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels between 2011 and 2015.Based on the ambient air quality monitoring, the data of 22 'non-attainment' states which have failed to meet the prescribed parameters was compiled by the board. ""Any parameter which is not within the prescribed parameters for five consecutive years is referred to as non-attainment,"" said Saha.The data reveals that nitrogen dioxide levels were dangerously high in three districts in Maharashtra-Badlapur, Pune and Ulhasnagar. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), NO2 is a toxic gas which can lead to respiratory ailments. The board has blamed encroachments and haphazard parking for high nitrogen dioxide emissions in urban areas. ""Slower the traffic, higher the unburnt emissions, especially nitrogen dioxide from vehicles. Local authorities are responsible for safeguarding environment and should ensure free movement of traffic to avoid toxic emissions,"" said Saha.According to CPCB, unscientific disposal of waste has led to major air pollution in almost all 94 cities. ""It is ridiculous that burning of waste has become a huge source of air pollution in almost all the cities. Local bodies, which are responsible for waste management, are allowing it,"" said Saha. Out of the 94, there is not a single city which meets the standards for PM10. ""Construction activities without mitigation measures and open burning are responsible for increasing PM10 levels,"" said Saha. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air quality fails to meet nat'l standard in 5 cities,"Jaipur: Pollution level has spiked in five cities of Rajasthan and air quality has failed to meet National Air Quality Standards as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report. Prominent cities from the state, including Alwar, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota and Udaipur, are among the 94 cities in the country where pollution levels are not meeting the set standards. As per the board, not a single city in the state meets the standards for PM10 (coarse particles). The fear for residents of these cities of having respiratory disease is on rise as these particles penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract and therefore constitute a risk for health by increasing mortality from respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and selected cardiovascular diseases.Additional superintendent at SMS hospital, Ajit Singh who is specialised allergy doctor says, ""PM10 particles include dust from roads and industries as well as toxic particles and from vehicular emission including carbon monoxide etc. Depending on their size, they can lodge in the trachea (windpipe) or in the bronchi (airway passages in the respiratory tract). Moreover they are also dangerous for the skin,"" he said.CPCB has analysed the data of Rajasthan cities crossed dangerous PM10 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels between 2011 and 2015.Based on the ambient air quality monitoring, Rajasthan was among 22 'non-attainment' other states which have failed to meet the prescribed parameters was compiled by the board. /""The state is considered as non-attainment after it failed to meet the parameters for five consecutive years,"" informed an official at Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. As urbanization is rapidly increasing in the state, the board has blamed encroachments and haphazard parking for high nitrogen dioxide emissions in urban areas. Moreover, increase in number of vehicles especially in Jaipur, state capital has also raised worries for civic authorities and environmental experts.""The city already has about 2 million vehicles and adds nearly 400 vehicles a day to its existing fleet,"" said a transport department official.A Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) official on the condition of anonymity, said, ""In absence of any state government's policy to control the increase of vehicles on many arterial roads, the traffic volume has exceeded the designed capacity and service level of the road. The mass transportation project such as Metro are biting dust since many years."" A survey conducted by JDA indicated that the rise in the number of private vehicles has affected the traffic speed with the average plummeting to 19 kmph or even slower at certain stretches. "" This clearly shows in Jaipur, the number of vehicles has increased manifolds , which has resulted high pollution,""According to CPCB, unscientific disposal of waste has led to major air pollution in almost all 94 cities including the cities of Rajasthan .

"Burning waste, vehicle fumes turn air toxic","CLEARED SKHERNashik: Once know for its salubrious climate and scenic beauty, the city now frequently has a haze in the air. Burning of waste, large number of private vehicles on the streets spewing toxic air and unkept public transport buses have triggered deterioration of the air quality in the city.Nashik was among the 94 cities across the country where PM10 (particulate matter 10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels were dangerously higher than the prescribed standards.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which tabled the list of cities in Parliament earlier this month, analysed the data of PM10 and NO2 levels between 2011 and 2015. Maharashtra leads the pack with most polluted cities (17) in the country, followed by Uttar Pradesh (15). Based on the ambient air quality monitoring, the data of 22 'non-attainment' states which have failed to meet the prescribed parameters was compiled by the board. Any parameter which is not within the prescribed parameters for five consecutive years is referred to as non-attainment.According to CPCB, unscientific disposal of waste has led to major air pollution in almost all 94 cities. Out of the 94, there is not a single city which meets the standards for PM10. The CPCB noted that construction activities without mitigation measures and open burning were responsible for increasing PM10 levels.The Nashik Municipal Corporation officials admitted that improper management of waste and rampant burning of garbage had vitiated the air quality in the city during that period. /""The air quality had suffered due to improper waste management and burning of garbage, both, by our conservancy workers and a section of citizens,"" said a source from NMC.NMC's health department officials said waste management in the city was not up to the mark during the period in question. ""There was rampant waste burning in the city. The municipal solid waste management plant was not fully operational and waste treatment was not optimal till 2016. There was no responsibility fixed for burning of waste,"" said an official from the health department.Even the environment status report placed by the civic administration before the general body last year showed that the areas near the civic body's headquarters, RTO Colony and Satpur MIDC had poorest air quality. ""The major pollutants were high traffic movement coupled with industrial and construction activities,"" the report stated. The report further pointed out that although Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) were within the permissible limits in the city, the Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) had exceeded the desirable limits in different parts of the city. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), NO2 is a toxic gas which can lead to respiratory ailments. The board has blamed encroachments and haphazard parking for high nitrogen dioxide emissions in urban areas.Constant rise in the number of vehicles in the city has not helped curb the pollution levels. The public transport system is in complete disarray as Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) is operating with skeleton fleet, forcing citizens to use their own vehicles.The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) said it will soon take steps to inform all municipal corporations in the state about the air quality of cities on a regular basis to address the problem. ""The MPCB will get in touch with the municipal corporations in Maharashtra to address the issue,"" said member secretary of MPCB, P Anbalagan.Activist Jagbir Singh, whose non-government organisation has been working against burning of waste, plastic for a decade, blamed the local MPCB office of doing precious little to tackle the city's air pollution.""It seems that MPCB officials in Nashik are not keen to address this grave problem. They are not even creating awareness among the citizens against burning of garbage,"" he alleged.Few years back, Jagbir and his volunteers created awareness among conservancy workers against waste burning by meeting them at the attendance sheds across the city early in the morning.

"Bhandewadi on fire yet again, residents choke","Nagpur: This summer is proving to be deadly for residents living near the Nagpur Municipal Corporation's (NMC) dumping ground in Bhandewadi which is continuously on fire since the temperatures started shooting up.According to the staffers of NMC's fire and emergency services department, around four to five fire tenders are being sent to Bhandewadi every day. ""Fire-fighting operations are being carried out day and night to ensure that the fire doesn't spread,"" they said.Since last two weeks, TOI received calls from residents of different localities, some staying even as far as 5-6 kilometres away from the dumping ground. They were complaining about the severe air pollution and health ailments. /On Thursday, TOI visited the spot and found that a large number of heaps of solid waste spread over different locations were smouldering.Apart from leading to massive air pollution with burning of all kinds of municipal solid waste including plastic, the fires pose a serious threat to human lives. At one location, TOI spotted a high-tension wire very close to burning heaps of garbage. ""Polythene bags often spread fire when they flow in air. We fear that if a burning polythene comes in contact with the HT line, it can lead to a serious mishap,"" said a resident.At another location, some houses were hardly 10 meters away from the burning waste. The smoke released from the fires is so thick that within five minutes it becomes difficult to breathe. ""Though we are constantly exposed to smoke, its intensity has increased in the last few weeks. Our rooms are filled with it, we are unable to sleep because of the stench. Everything looks hazy,"" the residents said.While TOI was interacting with the residents around 7pm, a motorist met with an accident after colliding with another vehicle. ""Accidents have become very frequent as there is hardly any visibility due to the thick layer of smoke,"" said a motorist.Anil Tripathi, who stays around 2 kilometres away from the dumping ground, said that a dense layer of smog engulfs the surrounding areas in the night, making it impossible to breathe. ""The smoke is accompanied by a strong smell. Since weeks we are facing breathlessness,"" he said. Since the last two days, residents living around the periphery of the ground have been staging protest at Bhandewadi, demanding immediate action from the civic body. NMC officials said that the civic body is under the process of implementing bio-mining for clearing the waste lying at Bhandewadi. Since last three years, TOI has been reporting on the frequent fires at the dumping ground. The unregulated trash burning is endangering urban lives by pumping cancer-causing gases into the atmosphere. Apart from significantly increasing the levels of particulate matter, various toxic gases like dioxins and furans are emitted by burning plastic material. Experts say these gases are believed to cause cancer. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
A workshop on air pollution awareness,"A seminar cum workshop on air pollution was recently organised by Bihar Industries Association. Abhishek Pratap, one of the moderators of seminar, said, ""It's high time we check air pollution. It has been observed that with the rise of air pollution, the number of chronic diseases increased. The Gangetic belt is considered to be the highest polluted area. Pragya Shankar, an environmentalist, said, ""The level of air pollution has reached to an alarming stage and not only the government, but youngsters too should come forward and solve this problem.""- Saurav Singh For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Large parts of India dotted with fires: Nasa images,"NEW DELHI: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) images of the past ten days show large parts of India are dotted with fires, stretching across Uttar Pradesh (UP), Madhya Pradesh (MP), Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and even some southern states. In sweltering summer, these fires are intensifying heat and causing black carbon (a component of soot with high global warming effect) pollution.Some of these dots may be forest fires but Hiren Jethva, research scientist at Nasa Goddard Space Flight Center, says fires in central India may be mostly crop fires as forest fires are usually uncontrolled and, therefore, produce more smoke and haze.Agricultural scientists are linking the massive rise in the incidence of crop fires in recent years to the dependence of farmers on combine harvesters, which leave a short stubble behind. The practice of crop stubble burning is not limited to the northern states of Haryana and Punjab, where the problem is rampant.While burning of paddy stubble has been a common practice among farmers since it is unsuitable as fodder, increasing incidence of wheat stubble burning is a relatively new trend. States with crop fires seen in Nasa maps have a dominant rice-wheat cropping system. /There are two choices of harvesting for farmers-manual or by combine harvester. But with acute shortage of labour, combine harvesters are turning out to be the quickest and cheapest mode of harvesting and preparing the soil for paddy.""I suspect that the use of combine harvesters is increasing across the country. During my research, I found that the single most important determinant of burning crop residue is the use of combine harvesters. Farmers just find it cheaper to burn residue than to clear it manually by employing labour. I also suspect that farmers are finding it harder to maintain animals or that fodder practices have changed, leading to farmers burning off even wheat residue. But this requires to be backed by research,"" says Ridhima Gupta, Indian School of Business (ISB) researcher, who studied the economics of farm fires in Punjab. During her research, she found that using manual labour is twice as expensive as using a harvester.According to Ridhima, crop stubble burning accounts for nearly 14 per cent of the country's black carbon emissions.The highest number of fires is being seen in MP. About 10 farmers have already been detained this year in Sehore for burning wheat stubble that spread fire to nearby farms. Earlier in April, flames from stubble fire spread on almost 1,500 ha in Harda and Betul districts. A woman in the state died after catching fire in a farm.State's junior agriculture minister Balkrishna Patidar tells TOI, ""We have been asking farmers to not burn crop residue as it is harmful not only for themselves, but also for the soil and environment. Still, the practice continues.""There is no official data linking increase in combine harvester use with crop fires. But the Economic Survey 2018 highlights how farm mechanisation has increased tremendously. In 1960-61, about 93 per cent of farm power was from animate sources, which has reduced to 10 per cent now. Mechanical and electrical sources have increased from 7 per cent to 90 per cent.""Multiple cropping and shortened cropping intervals leave little time to prepare for the next crop. It is too expensive to hire labour to clear stubble left behind by harvesters. Rural economy cannot absorb straw anymore for roofing of houses or granaries. Low commercial and economic value coupled with high costs of processing of residue reduce its usefulness for farmers. Burning it is cheaper and easier,"" adds Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).The Centre has allocated Rs 1,140.30 crore for a sub-mission on agriculture mechanisation in this year's Union budget, substantially hiking the funds from Rs 525 crore in 2017-18. This is mainly to deal with crop stubble burning in NCR states, where the practice is one of the major reasons for severe air pollution.""There should be ergonomic ways of managing stubble which will have to be supported by the government. In summer, fire spreads quickly, often burning the harvest itself and causing fire accidents,"" explains GV Ramajaneyulu, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture.(With inputs from /<a href=""mailto:Deshdeep.Saxena@timesgroup.com"">Deshdeep.Saxena@timesgroup.com</a>/ in Bhopal) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Doctors raise concern over air pollution,"Jaipur: With Jaipur falling among one of the 14 most polluted cities in the country as per the WHO survey, city-based pulmonologists have expressed concern over rising lung and respiratory illnesses.In an appeal, they have asked the state government to bring out a one-point agenda to ensure clean air to breath for coming generations. Claiming that children are most vulnerable to lung diseases, Dr Ashok Gupta, medical superintendent, JK Lon Hospital, said, ""Increased air pollution is associated with higher incidence of respiratory, cardiac and skin disorders. Children have a higher breathing rate compared to adults. /Hence, they are more prone to air pollution-related disorders. Among respiratory diseases, children have increased chances of having allergic rhinitis, asthma, pneumonia and chronic cough. These are more often seen in children doing physical exercise in highly polluted environment."" Former superintendent Sawai Man Singh Hospital, Dr Virendra Singh said, ""The figures by WHO indicate that a one-point programme should be launched by the government to ensure that the next generation gets clean air to breath. We do not want our cities to turn into gas chambers."" However, pulmonologists claimed that the situation has become even more grave. ""Now, we frequently see patients with refractory asthma (which remains uncontrolled despite taking medicines) and allergy due to the increase in air irritants. In recent years, there is an increase in patients with respiratory allergy due to urbanisation and increased air pollution,"" said Dr K K Sharma, pulmonologist at a private hospital.Besides, specialists claimed that their patients have said that they get respite from their ailments when they go out of the polluted atmosphere of Jaipur. ""There have been so many cases of patients telling us that that they get better as soon as they leave Jaipur and can live without medicines. Dust (in Jaipur) and air pollution together are a very lethal combination for people suffering from respiratory problems. However, in Jaipur, due to air pollution, respiratory diseases are on the rise,"" said Dr Adil Aziz, consultant medical practitioner at a private hospital.For timely relief, doctors suggest patients to take proper precautions. ""To reduce the detrimental effects of air pollution, patients, especially those with COPD or asthma, should be aware of the air quality and take extra measures such as reducing time outdoor and wear masks if necessary. For reducing air pollutants indoors, people should use clean fuels and improve stoves so as to burn fuel more efficiently and vent emissions to outside,"" said Dr Narendra Khippal, professor, department of chest and respiratory diseases, Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Medical College. Because of higher levels of air pollution, the most susceptible group of patients are those with lung diseases, pregnant, young and elderly populations. ""Rising levels of vehicular and industrial exhaust has led to dangerous levels of air pollution. The WHO has set a limit of 10\xB5g/m3 and the Indian government has set a limit of 40 \xB5g/m3 for PM2.5 levels. These dangerous particles enter the human body through breathing. Air pollutants cause an irreversible respiratory disease called COPD,"" said Dr Sheetu Singh, assistant professor, Institute of Respiratory Disease, SMS Medical College.

"Mumbai 4th most polluted megacity in world, 9 in 10 people breathe bad air","In an alarming reflection of the city's air pollution levels, the WHO's global air pollution database has ranked Mumbai as the fourth most polluted megacity in the world, up from last year's fifth place. The state capital has also been ranked the 63rd most polluted city among 859 considered by the WHO around the world. The study considered PM2.5 (particulate matter of diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) and PM10. PM2.5 is more dangerous than PM10. The period considered for the study was 2010 to 2016.Among 10 global megacities (habitation of above 14 million), Mumbai, with an average PM10 level of 104\xECg/m3 (microgram per cubic metre), came after Delhi (which topped the list), Cairo and Dhaka. /Shockingly, it was found to be more polluted than Beijing, which is always in news for its terrible smog-laden days, accompanied with pictures of people moving around in masks. The WHO's report stated that 9 in 10 people in the world breathe polluted air. In a statement, it said 7 million people die every year because of outdoor and household air pollution. ""Ambient air pollution alone caused some 4.2 million deaths in 2016, while household air pollution from cooking with polluting fuels and technologies caused an estimated 3.8 million deaths in the same period,"" it said.""Mumbai's air pollution is nearly as bad as Beijing's, but the city is not paying the required attention to this problem and that is alarming. It is time Mumbai woke up to the situation and took responsibility and react with the sort of urgency Bejing has reacted and how even Delhi is preparing to respond to its growing pollution,"" said Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner, Greenpeace. Quite a few factors contribute to Mumbai's high air pollution levels. ""Construction activity accounts for about 30% of dust particles, followed by vehicular emissions. In addition, open burning of garbage occurs in the city, adding to pollution,"" said Rakesh Kumar, director, National Environmental Engineering and Research Institute (NEERI).""Nevertheless, the Indian subcontinent cannot be directly compared with other regions of the world. Being in a tropical country, Indian cities have a lot of background pollutants like natural dust. This is why Indian cities have recorded higher level of pollutants (on the WHO list).""In Maharashtra, polluted cities include Pune, Navi Mumbai and Nagpur (not in that order; the global rank of a city based on its average PM2.5 level is different from that based on PM10). For Mumbai, WHO used data provided by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board from its monitoring stations in Sion and Bandra and monitoring stations by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).More than 90% of air pollution-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, mainly in Asia and Africa, followed by low- and middle-income countries in the eastern Mediterranean region, Europe and the Americas. WHO highlighted that air pollution is mainly responsible for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), causing an estimated one-quarter (24%) of all adult deaths from heart disease, 25% from stroke, 43% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 29% from lung cancer.

"Patna 5th, Gaya 3rd most polluted: WHO","PATNA: Patna is the fifth most polluted city in the world in terms of PM 2.5 concentration, according to a global air pollution datebase released by the World Health Organisation (WHO).PM 2.5 is the level of ultra-fine particles of less than 2.5 microns which invade human lungs and cause serious health problems, including cancer.Patna's PM 2.5 concentration was recorded at 144 micrograms per cubic metre, while the scenario in Gaya was worse with its PM 2.5 concentration being 149 per cubic metre. Gaya has been declared the third most polluted city of the world.Kanpur tops the global list of most polluted cities with PM 2.5 concentration of 173 micrograms per cubic metre, followed by Faridabad (172), and Varanasi (151). Delhi is sixth on the list.The air quality in Patna has deteriorated rapidly over the past few years. The city occupied 48th position among 1,600 cities in the WHO's database on urban outdoor air pollution released in 2014. It was declared the second most polluted country in India after New Delhi in the 2014 report.The air pollution database released by the WHO in 2016 had declared Patna as the sixth most polluted city in the world.Suspended road dust particles, vehicular emission and smoke billowing out of brick kilns have been linked to higher level of respiratory suspended particulate matter (PM 10) in Patna. /The WHO in the month of October 2013 classified outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic (cancer-causing agents).While admitting air pollution in Gaya and Patna, Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) chairman Dr Ashok Kumar Ghosh, however, challenged the WHO report. ""How can a city be called polluted on the basis of the data related to just one parameter (PM 2.5)? How can you leave out air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, ozone and petrol emission, among others?"" Ghosh asked.Talking about the steps initiated by the BSPCB to curb air pollution, Ghosh said on Wednesday they were working along with the state forest department to carry out plantation along the banks of Ganga, where alluvial topsoil is exposed due to meandering of the river towards the north, causing dust pollution in Patna.""We are also working along with the transport department to ensure stringent vehicle pollution checks through PUC (pollution under control) testing centres at petrol pumps. An estimated 80% brick kilns have adopted green technology, which has lower levels of emissions,"" Ghosh said.The Bihar State Disaster Management Authority has also conducted an assessment of Patna's air quality across 10 microenvironments using a state-of-the-art mobile online laboratory in association with scientists from Indian Institute of Tropical Management (IITM), Pune.According to Dr Subhash C Jha of the PMCH's TB and Chest department, patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and respiratory infections have a high chance of turning ICU cases. ""We often advise COPD patients to move to locations that have lower levels of air pollutants,"" he said. Dr Jha said there had been an increase in the incidence of tonsillitis, allergic pharyngitis and bronchitis. ""If the pollutants enter the lungs, there is an increase in the incidence of bronchiolitis, pneumonia and lung cancer,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
14 of world's 15 most polluted cities in India,"NEW DELHI: Delhi is not the most polluted city in the world. But that's hardly any reason to cheer. The WHO global air pollution database released in Geneva early Wednesday morning reveals that India has 14 out of the 15 most polluted cities in the world in terms of PM 2.5 concentrations, with the worst being Kanpur. Despite public outcry over severe air pollution, and both Centre and Delhi government taking up the issue, WHO's database of more than 4,000 cities in 100 countries shows that Delhi's pollution levels improved only marginally between 2010 and 2014 but started deteriorating again in 2015. In 2016, the latest year in WHO's database, Delhi was in sixth spot, having recorded its highest pollution levels in six years. /The city's PM 2.5 annual average was 143 micrograms per cubic metre, more than three times the national safe standard, while the PM 10 average was 292 micrograms per cubic metre, more than 4.5 times the national standard. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had recently claimed that air pollution levels improved in 2017 as compared to 2016. The board, however, hasn't released the annual average PM 2.5 concentration for 2017 yet. A number of policies came into effect towards the end of 2016 - the graded response action plan (GRAP) in October, doubling of the environment compensation charge (ECC) on trucks in December 2015 and better coordination among NCR states on pollution control.The WHO report, however, doesn't reflect this because it considers annual PM 10 and PM 2.5 averages between 2010 and 2016. Delhi unable to keep pace with Beijing in bad-air fightExperts Not Sure What Led To Sudden Spike In Delhi Pollution In 2015 And 2016.The data sources for Delhi is mainly from CPCB (about 10 stations), although for the years 2015 and 2016 WHO also considered data from ministry of earth sciences (MoES) and US Environment Protection Agency's (EPA) Air Now. This may have also influenced the air pollution concentrations for 2015 and 2016, experts said.Kanpur topped the 2016 list with a PM 2.5 concentration of 173 micrograms per cubic metre, followed by Faridabad, Varanasi and Gaya.Ironically, as India's air pollution monitoring network improved in the past few years with more cities being monitored, the number of Indian cities in the top polluters' list zoomed.""With improved air quality monitoring, we are beginning to understand the depth and spread of the air pollution problem in India. While Delhi is at the crossroads and is expected to bend the curve post 2016, other pollution hot spots are proliferating across the country,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).""This is a national public health crisis and the newly proposed national clean air action plan has to ensure stringent action in all cities to comply with clean air standards,"" Chowdhury said.In 2010, Delhi was the worst polluted city globally followed by Peshawar and Rawalpindi. Agra was the only other Indian city in the top 10 polluted (PM 2.5) cities, in 2011 too Delhi and Agra were the only two Indian cities and Ulaanbaatar was the worst.But this started changing 2012 onward when 14 out of top 20 most polluted were in India. In 2013, 2014 and 2015 too, four to seven Indian cities were in top20. But in the 2016 data released on Wednesday, 14 out of 15 most polluted are in India.As for Delhi, experts are not sure what may have led to a sudden spike in 2015 and 2016. ""In 2015 and 2016, there were northwesterly winds in the crop burning season which brought particulate pollution from neighbouring states. These meteorological factors may have also accentuated air pollution in Delhi,"" said Dipankar Saha, former CPCB air lab head.In contrast, many Chinese cities are improving. In 2016 only four Chinese cities -Baoding, Hengshui, Xingtai and Anyang - were in top 20 compared to 14 Chinese cities, including Beijing, in 2013's top 20.Delhi and Beijing are often compared due to their high air pollution levels and policies like the odd-even road rationing measure or air pollution emergency action plan. However, WHO's recent data shows that Beijing's air pollution levels have been consistently reducing 2013 onwards.In 2016, Beijing's PM 2.5 concentration was 73 micrograms per cubic metre compared to Delhi's 143. ""There are cities that have seen a decrease in PM2.5 level, Beijing and Mexico, if you look at the data. China has put a number of measures since 2013, from a National Action Plan of Air pollution Control, enforcement of environmental standards etc,"" WHO said, responding to TOI's questionnaire.WHO said that 9 out of 10 people in the world breathe air containing high levels of pollutants. ""Updated estimations reveal an alarming death toll of 7 million people every year caused by ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution. Ambient air pollution alone caused some 4.2 million deaths in 2016, while household air pollution from cooking with polluting fuels and technologies caused an estimated 3.8 million deaths,"" it said.WHO also highlighted that air pollution is mainly responsible for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), causing an estimated one-quarter (24%) of all adult deaths from heart disease, 25% from stroke, 43% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 29% from lung cancer.

"India tops world in bad air quality: Kanpur, Delhi among top 15, Mumbai 4th most polluted megacity","NEW DELHI: According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) global air pollution database released in Geneva, India has 14 out of the 15 most polluted cities in the world in terms of PM 2.5 concentrations -- the worst being Kanpur with a PM 2.5 concentration of 173 micrograms per cubic metre, followed by Faridabad, Varanasi and Gaya.Other Indian cities that registered very high levels of PM2.5 pollutants are Delhi, Patna, Agra, Muzaffarpur, Srinagar, Gurgaon, Jaipur, Patiala and Jodhpur, followed by Ali Subah Al-Salem in Kuwait and a few cities in China and Mongolia.India's financial capital Mumbai is the world's fourth most polluted megacity. The study considered PM2.5 (particulate matter of diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) and PM10. PM2.5 is more dangerous than PM10. The period considered for the study was 2010 to 2016.WHAT THE WHO REPORT SAIDThe report states that 9 in 10 people in the world breathe polluted air. In a statement, it said 7 million people die every year because of outdoor and household air pollution. ""Ambient air pollution alone caused some 4.2 million deaths in 2016, while household air pollution from cooking with polluting fuels and technologies caused an estimated 3.8 million deaths in the same period,"" it said. QUICK EDIT: Don't breathe, 14 of 15 most polluted cities in India More than 90% of air pollution-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, mainly in Asia and Africa, followed by low- and middle-income countries in the eastern Mediterranean region, Europe and the Americas. /""Air pollution threatens us all, but the poorest and most marginalised people bear the brunt of the burden,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.WHO highlighted that air pollution is mainly responsible for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), causing an estimated one-quarter (24%) of all adult deaths from heart disease, 25% from stroke, 43% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 29% from lung cancer.The organisation stressed that although its report provides air quality data from more than 4,300 cities and towns in 108 countries, there was an unevenness in the information received, with a dire lack of data from Africa and parts of the Western Pacific region. Only eight of the 47 countries in Africa provided air quality information about one or more of their cities. And while the database listed information on 181 Indian cities, it provided data for only nine Chinese cities.The WHO's collected annual mean concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) includes pollutants, such as sulphate, nitrates and black carbon, which pose the greatest risks to human health. Major sources of air pollution from particulate matter include the inefficient use of energy by households, industry, the agriculture and transport sectors, and coal-fired power plants. In some regions, sand and desert dust, waste burning and deforestation are additional sources of air pollution.DELHI HAS NO REASON NO CHEERWhile Delhi is not the most polluted city in the world, it's hardly reason to cheer. Despite public outcry over severe air pollution, and both Centre and Delhi government taking up the issue, the report shows that Delhi's pollution levels improved only marginally between 2010 and 2014 but started deteriorating again in 2015. In 2016, the latest year in WHO's database, Delhi was in sixth spot, having recorded its highest pollution levels in six years. The city's PM 2.5 annual average was 143 micrograms per cubic metre, more than three times the national safe standard, while the PM 10 average was 292 micrograms per cubic metre, more than 4.5 times the national standard.The data source for Delhi is mainly from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) (about 10 stations), although for the years 2015 and 2016 WHO also considered data from ministry of earth sciences (MoES) and US Environment Protection Agency's (EPA) Air Now. This may have also influenced the air pollution concentrations for 2015 and 2016, experts said.Ironically, as India's air pollution monitoring network improved in the past few years with more cities being monitored, the number of Indian cities in the top polluters' list zoomed.""With improved air quality monitoring, we are beginning to understand the depth and spread of the air pollution problem in India. While Delhi is at the crossroads and is expected to bend the curve post 2016, other pollution hot spots are proliferating across the country,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).""This is a national public health crisis and the newly proposed national clean air action plan has to ensure stringent action in all cities to comply with clean air standards,"" Chowdhury said.In 2010, Delhi was the worst polluted city globally followed by Peshawar and Rawalpindi. Agra was the only other Indian city in the top 10 polluted (PM 2.5) cities, in 2011 too Delhi and Agra were the only two Indian cities and Ulaanbaatar was the worst.But this started changing 2012 onward when 14 out of top 20 most polluted were in India. In 2013, 2014 and 2015 too, four to seven Indian cities were in top 20. But in the 2016 data released on Wednesday, 14 out of 15 most polluted are in India.LEVELS SEE IMPROVEMENT IN 2017The CPCB had recently claimed that Delhi's air pollution levels improved in 2017 as compared to 2016. The board, however, hasn't released the annual average PM 2.5 concentration for 2017 yet.A number of policies came into effect towards the end of 2016 - the graded response action plan (GRAP) in October, doubling of the environment compensation charge (ECC) on trucks in December 2015 and better coordination among NCR states on pollution control.The WHO report, however, doesn't reflect this because it considers annual PM 10 and PM 2.5 averages between 2010 and 2016.DELHI UNABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH BEIJINGExperts are not sure what may have led to a sudden spike in Delhi's pollution levels in 2015 and 2016. ""In 2015 and 2016, there were northwesterly winds in the crop burning season which brought particulate pollution from neighbouring states. These meteorological factors may have also accentuated air pollution in Delhi,"" said Dipankar Saha, former CPCB air lab head.In contrast, many Chinese cities are improving. In 2016 only four Chinese cities -Baoding, Hengshui, Xingtai and Anyang - were in top 20 compared to 14 Chinese cities, including Beijing, in 2013's top 20.Delhi and Beijing are often compared due to their high air pollution levels and policies like the odd-even road rationing measure or air pollution emergency action plan. However, WHO's recent data shows that Beijing's air pollution levels have been consistently reducing 2013 onwards.In 2016, Beijing's PM 2.5 concentration was 73 micrograms per cubic metre compared to Delhi's 143. ""There are cities that have seen a decrease in PM2.5 level, Beijing and Mexico, if you look at the data. China has put a number of measures since 2013, from a National Action Plan of Air pollution Control, enforcement of environmental standards etc,"" WHO said, responding to TOI's questionnaire.MUMBAI IS WORLD'S 4TH MOST POLLUTED CITYIn an alarming reflection of the city's air pollution levels, WHO ranked Mumbai as the fourth most polluted megacity in the world, up from last year's fifth place, also being ranked the 63rd most polluted city among 859 considered by the WHO around the world. Among 10 global megacities (habitation of above 14 million), Mumbai, with an average PM10 level of 104\xECg/m3 (microgram per cubic metre), came after Delhi (which topped the list), Cairo and Dhaka. Shockingly, it was found to be more polluted than Beijing, which is always in news for its terrible smog-laden days, accompanied with pictures of people moving around in masks. Mumbai's air pollution is nearly as bad as Beijing's, but the city is not paying the required attention to this problem and that is alarming. It is time Mumbai woke up to the situation and took responsibility and react with the sort of urgency Bejing has reacted and how even Delhi is preparing to respond to its growing pollution,"" said Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner, Greenpeace. Quite a few factors contribute to Mumbai's high air pollution levels. ""Construction activity accounts for about 30% of dust particles, followed by vehicular emissions. In addition, open burning of garbage occurs in the city, adding to pollution,"" said Rakesh Kumar, director, National Environmental Engineering and Research Institute (NEERI).""Nevertheless, the Indian subcontinent cannot be directly compared with other regions of the world. Being in a tropical country, Indian cities have a lot of background pollutants like natural dust. This is why Indian cities have recorded higher level of pollutants (on the WHO list).""In Maharashtra, polluted cities include Pune, Navi Mumbai and Nagpur (not in that order). For Mumbai, WHO used data provided by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board from its monitoring stations in Sion and Bandra and monitoring stations by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).JAIPUR IS RAJASTHAN'S MOST POLLUTED CITYThe Pink City too is not in the pink of health, according to the WHO report which said Jaipur is the most polluted city in the desert state, followed by Jodhpur, Kota, Alwar and Udaipur. The samples were collected in different years in different districts.Jaipur recorded the highest level of PM10 (Particles smaller than 10 microns) in the state. The international standards of air pollution says that index value of 0-50 (micrograms per cubic meter air) is excellent, 51-100 is good, 101-150 is lightly polluted.""If the PM10 is more than 150, then it is alarming. If PM 10 is up to 100, then it is satisfactory,"" said Dr Ajit Singh, respiratory allergy specialist, department of medicine, Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital.He said, ""The example of PM10 is dust particles, moulds and pollens. These particles easily reach upto the lungs to cause various diseases related to lungs and respiration.""According to the health experts, PM10 particles can penetrate into the lungs and may enter the bloodstream. It can cause heart disease, lung cancer, asthma and acute lower respiratory infection. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Jaipur most polluted city in Rajasthan, says WHO report","JAIPUR: The Pink City is not in the pink of health if the World Health Organisation (WHO) pollution report is to go by.

It is followed by Jodhpur, Kota, Alwar and Udaipur. /The samples were collected in different years in different districts.The WHO has measured Particle Matter 10 (Particles smaller than 10 microns) in different cities of the world.

"Kolkata is 2nd-most polluted metro, air quality worsening faster than Delhi's","KOLKATA: A report by the World Health Organization (WHO) has finally confirmed that Kolkata is the second-most polluted metropolis in the country, next only to Delhi. The study revealed another alarming trend: Kolkata's air quality is declining faster than Delhi's.The latest WHO database of more than 4,000 cities across 100 countries for the year 2016 was released on Wednesday at the organization's headquarters in Geneva. It painted a grim picture for the city. In 2015, the annual mean of PM2.5 (fine particulate matter that leads to high plaque deposits in arteries, which can lead to heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems) of Kolkata was 52\xB5g/m\xB3 (microgram per cubic metre), which climbed to 74\xB5g/m\xB3 in 2016. Significantly, according to WHO, the safe limit of annual mean PM2.5 is 10\xB5g/m\xB3, but by India's standards, it is 40\xB5g/m\xB3. Alarmingly, the annual mean of PM2.5 in Kolkata is 7 times higher than the global safe limit. /According to environmentalists, Kolkata's air quality is now even worse than what the WHO figures suggest.In 2017, the city's pollution rose faster than ever before because of an exponential growth in the number of vehcles, construction activities and biomass burning, three key causes of air pollution. ""The WHO report is a clarion call for all of us to wake from our slumber and do something drastic to improve the city's air quality,"" said environmentalist Subhas Datta, who has kept pricking the conscience of the city by his numerous litigations in the National Green Tribunal (NGT).Even in terms of PM10 (far bigger and coarser particulate matter) count, the degradation of the city's air has been quite steep. In 2015, the annual mean of PM10 count was 95\xB5g/m\xB3, whereas it jumped to 136\xB5g/m\xB3 in 2016. The safe limit, according to WHO, for annual mean of PM10 is 20\xB5g/m\xB3. That, too, has had to be increased to an ""Indian"" safe standard: 60\xB5g/m\xB3.Kanpur, however, topped the 2016 list with a PM2.5 concentration of 173\xB5g/m\xB3, followed by Faridabad, Varanasi and Gaya. Ironically, as India's air pollution monitoring network improved in the past few years with more cities being monitored, the number of Indian cities in the top polluters' list also zoomed.""There is no point in being complacent from the fact that Kolkata is better than the worst polluted cities in India,"" said city-based environmental activist Somendra Mohan Ghosh. ""We are in a thickly populated city, where the impact of the degradation is far worse. Kolkata accounts for the highest number of lung cancer cases. The rate of degradation is steeper than most metros and attempts to check pollution are scarce,"" he added.The WHO report pointed out that 9 out of 10 people in the world breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.

10 reasons why Gurugram is among world's most polluted cities,"Three days after the World Health Organisation (WHO) released its report on the most polluted cities, where Gurgaon ranked 11th, a TOI team visited the most polluted spots in the city to understand the root cause of the problem.Iffco ChowkReason: Vehicular pollution, construction dustThis traffic junction connects three arterial roads in the city - NH-8, Sector 14 road and MG Road - and is one of its busiest stretches. However, the construction of the underpass that is going on at this stretch for the past year and a half, has added to the woes of commuters. Construction dust added with traffic jams has left commuters unhappy and gasping for breath.Rajiv Chowk Reason: Construction dustA recent survey by Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) identified Rajiv Chowk as the city's most polluted spot. Connecting Sohna road with Old Gurgaon and NH-8, there are a number of construction sites on this stretch. /Blatant violations of NGT norms can be seen here, as construction sites are not properly covered leading to clouds of dust spreading across the area. Golf Course Road ExtensionReason: Burning of wasteConnecting Golf Course Road with Sohna road, this road has witnessed a sudden increase in traffic movement in the last three years, with several buildings coming up in sectors 61, 62 and 66, and residents moving in. Waste burning is a major problem here. Residents claimed 2-3 cases of waste burning in this area are reported almost every day. ""We need to keep our apartment doors and windows shut, as black smoke keeps billowing from waste burning nearby,"" said Harish Garg, who lives in a highrise in the area. Dust pollution is also high here due to on-going work at buildings being constructed along the road. The road infrastructure, too, is in bad shape.Sohna roadReason: Vehicular pollution, burning of wasteOver the past 10 years, Sohna road has become an important commercial hub, as several MNCs moved to sectors located along it. Apart from commercial buildings, this stretch houses 10 highrises, six housing societies and three luxury residential projects.As it connects Gurgaon to Sohna, Alwar and SPR, heavy vehicles ply on it day and night, causing vehicular pollution. Residents have also complained about waste being dumped and set afire at vacant spots along the road, leading to air pollution.Old Delhi-Gurgaon RoadReason: Vehicular pollutionMassive encroachment has taken place along the road, leading to traffic congestion. Many a time, authorities have carried out anti-enroachment drives on this stretch, but have failed to stop squatters from re-settling. ""We thought NH-8 would help decongest this stretch, but that didn't happen. Encroachment by commercial establishments adds to traffic snarls in the area.

Alert: 4 DANGEROUS health hazards of DUST STORM (and what you can do)!,"The dust storms that have hit North India have led to damage that has been the worst in the last 20 years! While the death toll is sadly still on a rise and news channels are flashing that the worst is yet to arrive, the country can't stop wondering what can be done to prevent damage. Also, the ecological costs are getting insurmountable as as per the environment ministry, a quarter of the country's land is witnessing desertification. However, if we talk about the health harms that the storm brings along, there are primarily four. /Even if you are sitting inside locked doors and are apparently safe, the quality of air won't give you a respite.What actually is a dust storm?Dust storm is a phenomenon that is common in hot and dry climates. The word dust storm is English for the Arabic word Haboob, meaning violent and gusty winds.Talking simply, it is a large availability of sand or dust along with sustained wind such that the wind can get the particles moving. One common consequence, thus, is poor visibility.The faster the wind blows, the worse repercussions it has. A speesd as less as 25 mph can lead to loosening of the particles. In India, the speed is likely to touch 70 kmph, ranging from 50 to 60 mostly.Dust storms and squalls are commonly accompanied by thunderstorms and rain. The dangers of dust stormThe air quality in North India has worsened in the past days, crossing 250 in the NCR. The main pollutant is PM 2.5, the deadly tiny particle. As per studies, PM 2.5 can lead to various health hazards, including premature death.PM 2.5 is so tiny that it cannot be seen by naked eye. Hence, it can easily enter your body by surpassing your nasal hair and throat. Also, the particles can infiltrate your body's defence system and very badly affect your respiratory system.This can lead to chronic problems such as bronchitis, asthma, heart problems and many respiratory problems. For people who are already suffering from asthma, this can be much worse as it can lead to worsening of the lung function.Besides PM 2.5, the dust storms can also be carriers of heavy metals such as arsenic, fertilisers and pesticides and many other bacteria, fungi and viruses. Dust storms can also lead to dust pneumonia, a condition of excessive exposure to dust which leads to the filling of lungs with dust and the inflammation of the alveoli. It was a very common condition during the Dust Bowl of the United States. Common symptoms of the disease include chest pain, coughing, high fever and breathing difficulty. The disease is often fatal.The flying dust particles can also often get into your eyes, leading to problems such as eye injuries, corneal scratches and depending on what gets into it, the condition can be much severe.How to save yourself?The best bet would be to stay indoors as much as possible while keeping the doors and windows closed. However, make sure that you are purifying the air by using an efficient particulate air filter as often, the air stuck inside homes can be worse than the air outdoors.Wear an air pollution mask and make sure that it is N95 certified as only those ones have been tested for filtration performance. Eat foods that increase your resistance against PM 2.5, such as Vitamin C, E and beta carotene rich foods. They include green leafy vegetables, almonds, carrots and many more. Do not light candles or stay in smoky atmosphere when indoors. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

The word dust storm is English for the Arabic word Haboob, meaning violent and gusty winds.Talking simply, it is a large availability of sand or dust along with sustained wind such that the wind can get the particles moving. One common consequence, thus, is poor visibility.The faster the wind blows, the worse repercussions it has. A speesd as less as 25 mph can lead to loosening of the particles.

The dangers of dust stormThe air quality in North India has worsened in the past days, crossing 250 in the NCR. The main pollutant is PM 2.5, the deadly tiny particle. As per studies, PM 2.5 can lead to various health hazards, including premature death.PM 2.5 is so tiny that it cannot be seen by naked eye. Hence, it can easily enter your body by surpassing your nasal hair and throat. Also, the particles can infiltrate your body's defence system and very badly affect your respiratory system.This can lead to chronic problems such as bronchitis, asthma, heart problems and many respiratory problems. For people who are already suffering from asthma, this can be much worse as it can lead to worsening of the lung function.Besides PM 2.5, the dust storms can also be carriers of heavy metals such as arsenic, fertilisers and pesticides and many other bacteria, fungi and viruses. Dust storms can also lead to dust pneumonia, a condition of excessive exposure to dust which leads to the filling of lungs with dust and the inflammation of the alveoli. It was a very common condition during the Dust Bowl of the United States. Common symptoms of the disease include chest pain, coughing, high fever and breathing difficulty. The disease is often fatal.The flying dust particles can also often get into your eyes, leading to problems such as eye injuries, corneal scratches and depending on what gets into it, the condition can be much severe.How to save yourself?The best bet would be to stay indoors as much as possible while keeping the doors and windows closed. However, make sure that you are purifying the air by using an efficient particulate air filter as often, the air stuck inside homes can be worse than the air outdoors.Wear an air pollution mask and make sure that it is N95 certified as only those ones have been tested for filtration performance. Eat foods that increase your resistance against PM 2.5, such as Vitamin C, E and beta carotene rich foods. They include green leafy vegetables, almonds, carrots and many more.

"India, China account for over half of global deaths due to air pollution: Report","NEW DELHI: A US-study has estimated that India and China together account for more than half of global deaths due to air pollution. The US-based Health Effects Institute's State of Global Air study, released in Boston on Tuesday, has also found that increasing exposure to air pollution combined with an ageing population has led to India rivalling China in health burden from bad air. The report states that China's PM2.5 pollution levels have started stabilising and people's exposure to particulate pollution has also started declining but it's on a steep rise in India. /The death rate (deaths per lakh), however, is seeing a declining trend in both the countries. In 1990, China saw 146 air pollution-related deaths per lakh of its population. This decreased to 80 for 2016. India on the other hand saw a steady decline in death rate between 1990 and 2010, when it fell from 150 to 123. The rate, however, has marginally increased in six years between 2010 and 2016 - the year for which the latest data is available. ""Although China experienced substantial increases in population-weighted exposures (PM 2.5) before 2010 - reflecting in part the dramatic scale of economic development in recent decades - since then the exposures have stabilised...,"" the report states. The burden of non-communicable diseases among the ageing population is increasing in developing countries. For example, among those of 70 years of age or older, PM2.5-attributable ischemic heart disease alone accounted for 16.2% of life years lost due to disease or what medical experts call disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in China, 17.8% in India and more than 20% in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East in 2016. The report further states that Indian and China could be experiencing a ""double burden"" due to combined exposure to outdoor air pollution and household air pollution. In 2016, a total of 2.45 billion people (33.7% of the global population) were exposed to household air pollution. ""India and China - with 43% and 30% of their populations, respectively, using solid fuels -had the largest numbers of people exposed to household air pollution in 2016: 560 million in India and 416 million in China,"" the report reads. ""Impact and benefits of action are showing up in health indicators in China. Scale and stringency of action have certainly made a difference,"" Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said in reaction to the study. The report acknowledges that the Indian government has begun taking action to improve air quality. But it says India needs to take aggressive action on reducing emissions from household biomass combustion, coal burning and dust pollution. Overall, the report stated that seven billion people - more than 95 per cent of the world's population - live in areas with unhealthy air. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air quality near Maurya Lok, vet college very poor","PATNA: The air quality near Maurya Lok Complex, Bihar Veterinary College and Walmi has been found to be ""very poor"", as per 'An Assessment Report of Air Quality of Patna City at Different Micro-Environment' released by deputy CM and minister of environment and forest department Sushil Kumar Modi on Wednesday. The assessment was made by Bihar State Disaster Management Authority (BSDMA) through Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, in collaboration with the Centre for Environment, Energy & Climate Change (CEECC) at ADRI between October 19 and November 28, 2017.The assessment covered major pollutants which were monitored by state-of-the-art mobile air quality monitoring laboratory (MAML) at ten places in the city. As per the report, veterinary college and Walmi reported an AQI of 346 and 307 respectively. /""This level of AQI is reported to cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. The effect may be more pronounced in people with lung and heart diseases,"" the report observed.The area near Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, Pant Bhawan, Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) premises and Aryabhatta Knowledge University had 'poor' air quality with 297, 284, 258 and 234 AQI respectively. That level of AQI may cause breathing discomfort to people with heart diseases.The report observed that Patna's poor air quality was due to particulate matters and high level of fine particles (PM2.5 and PM10) was observed at all locations. ""The traffic sector contributes mainly to high concentration of particulate pollutants and locations like Maurya Lok Complex and Pant Bhawan have concentrations more than the prescribed limit,"" the report said. The level of gaseous pollutants in Patna was found mostly within permissible limit, baring a few exceptions.Modi said the state government would soon write a letter to the central government to make provisions for banning vehicles older than 15 years in big cities such as in Patna to check air pollution. ""The Motor Vehicles Act 1988 has no provision to ban vehicles older than 15 years. NCR region is an exception to this. We, till the time being, will try to make the provisions to obtain pollution control certificate more stringent,"" he said. However, Modi said though air pollution was a big problem, there was no need to panic. ""I have asked BSPCB to install at least three out of the proposed five air quality monitoring stations in the next 6 to 8 months. Data gaps in the air quality assessment by Patna's only monitoring station provides insufficient information,"" he said.Modi also asked BSPCB to come up with a toll-free number for people to register their complaints relating to pollution issues. He also announced plantation of 10,000 trees by the state government in the city and along the banks of the Ganga where the top alluvial soil was exposed leading to an increase in dust particles in the air.

"PM2.5 levels rising in proportion to stubble burning, finds Nasa study","New Delhi: A new study by Nasa scientists has concluded that there is a strong link between agricultural fires in Punjab and Haryana and PM2.5 levels in Delhi during the post-monsoon months of October and November.PM2.5 concentrations in Delhi, which is downwind to Punjab and Haryana, show a coherent increase - rising often from as low as 50 micrograms per cubic metres (\xB5g/m3) before the onset of the burning season to 300\xB5g/m3 at the beginning of November when burning is under way. During the crop burning season of 2016, the seven-day average peaked to a record high of 550\xB5g/m3. This could also explain the severe smog episode in November 2016 when PM2.5 concentration peaked to more than 700\xB5g/m3 on November 5, 2016. But the study also cautions that the impact of emissions from local sources, including more than 9.5 million vehicles, industries and construction activities, cannot be ruled out. However, this study could give the government clues to averting smog episodes. While the link between crop burning and winter pollution peak was being speculated for long, this is the first scientific study to correlate fire counts in Punjab and Haryana with wind direction and parallel rise in PM2.5 concentrations in Delhi. /The study that analysed satellite data for 15 years (2002-2016) also revealed an increasing trend in crop fires. It found that there is a shift in the distribution of fires from October to November. This study, which has been accepted recently to be published in the journal of Aerosols and Air Quality Research (AAQR), uses fire data from satellites, pollution data from Nasa's A-train sensors and PM2.5 concentrations measured at the US Embassy in Chanakyapuri. Scientists also conducted a back trajectory (path taken by air pollution particles in the past) using a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) model. Compared to paddy stubble burning in October-November, fire counts in May (wheat stubble burning season) were found to by lower by a factor of six to eight. As far as post-monsoon pollution is concerned, just by excluding PM2.5 data for October and November, the annual mean concentrations decreased by 10%, 7%, 12% and 13% for 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.""Overall, the fire counts and PM2.5 concentrations showed a linear relationship, which yields an increase in PM2.5 of 33\xB5g/m3, given an increment in fire counts by about 100 ..."" the study concluded. Back-trajectory modelling also gave scientists a clue as to why Delhi may be worst affected by crop fires. Days with extreme levels of PM2.5 were mostly associated with northwesterly winds from crop burning areas, ""suggesting a profound impact of smoke transport on modulating air quality over Delhi"", the study said.While concluding that crop fires are on the rise in Punjab and Haryana, satellite data also reveal that the number of fires was higher in October between 2002 and 2009. But this trend has now changed and a majority of fires are being recorded in November. The number of fire counts detected between 2009 and 2016 was found to be 32% higher than those found between 2002 and 2009 by one of the satellites. But, in 2016, fires were at a record high, which also possibly explains the severe smog episode in 2016 in Delhi. ""The crop burning season of 2016 has been most anomalous with maximum fire hotspots (17,804) detected over the Punjab-Haryana region ... compared to average fire counts (14,310) detected between 2011 and 2015, the total fire counts in 2016 were 24% higher,"" the study added.

"PM2.5 levels rising in proportion to stubble burning, finds Nasa study","NEW DELHI: A new study by Nasa scientists has concluded that there is a strong link between agricultural fires in Punjab and Haryana and PM2.5 levels in Delhi during the post-monsoon months of October and November. PM2.5 concentrations in Delhi, which is downwind to Punjab and Haryana, show a coherent increase - rising often from as low as 50 micrograms per cubic metres (\xB5g/ m3) before the onset of the burning season to 300\xB5g/m3 at the beginning of November when burning is under way. During the crop burning season of 2016, the seven-day average peaked to a record high of 550\xB5g/m3. This could also explain the severe smog episode in November 2016 when PM2.5 concentration peaked to more than 700\xB5g/ m3 on November 5, 2016. But the study also cautions that the impact of emissions from local sources, including more than 9.5 million vehicles, industries and construction activities, cannot be ruled out. However, this study could give the government clues to averting smog episodes. /While the link between crop burning and winter pollution peak was being speculated for long, this is the first scientific study to correlate fire counts in Punjab and Haryana with wind direction and parallel rise in PM2.5 concentrations in Delhi. The study that analysed satellite data for 15 years (2002-2016) also revealed an increasing trend in crop fires. Itfound that there is a shift in the distribution of fires from October to November. This study, which has been accepted recently to be published in the journal of Aerosols and Air Quality Research (AAQR), uses fire data from satellites, pollution data from Nasa's A-train sensors and PM2.5 concentrations measured at the US Embassy in Chanakyapuri. Scientists also conducted aback trajectory (path taken by air pollution particles in the past) using a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) model. Compared to paddy stubble burning in October-November, fire counts in May (wheat stubble burning season) were found to by lower by a factor of six to eight. As far as post-monsoon pollution is concerned, just by excluding PM2.5 data for October and November, the annual mean concentrations decreased by 10%, 7%, 12% and 13% for 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. ""Overall, the fire counts and PM2.5 concentrations showed a linear relationship, which yields an increase in PM2.5 of 33\xB5g/m3, given an increment in fire counts by about 100 ..."" the study concluded. Back-trajectory modelling also gave scientists a clue as to why Delhi may be worst affected by crop fires. Days with extreme levels of PM2.5 were mostly associated with northwesterly winds from crop burning areas, ""suggesting a profound impact of smoke transport on modulating air quality over Delhi"", the study said.While concluding that crop fires are on the rise in Punjab and Haryana, satellite data also reveal that the number of fires was higher in October between 2002 and 2009. But this trend has now changed and a majority of fires are being recorded in November. The number of fire counts detected between 2009 and 2016 was found to be 32% higher than those found between 2002 and 2009 by one of the satellites. But, in 2016, fires were at a record high, which also possibly explains the severe smog episode in 2016 in Delhi.

Safar data shows city's air quality is worse than Delhi's,"Ahmedabad: Data from the Union ministry of earth science's System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) showed on Saturday that the air quality index (AQI) of Ahmedabad was worse among the metro cities monitored by Safar. Among individual localities, Satellite area of Ahmedabad, had the worst AQI, 333. The higher the AQI, the poorer the air quality and particulate matter denser in the air.While Delhi has an AQI of 278, Ahmedabad has 310, making the air quality of the city worse than any other big city in the country monitored by Safar. Cities like Mumbai and Pune have AQI below 90.Almost all the areas in Ahmedabad barring Rakhial, had a high AQI according to Safar. /Rakhial had the lowest AQI in the city, 289, but even this was higher than that of Mathura Road, the most polluted area of Delhi which has an AQI of 282.Safar states that on Sunday, too, the AQI in Ahmedabad is likely to remain over 300. In its health advisory, Safar states, ""Everyone should reduce heavy exertion. People with heart or lung disease, adults and children, should avoid longer or heavy exertion.""In Ahmedabad the western part of the city, which includes Navrangpura, Satellite, Bopal, Chandkheda the AQI was above 300 with Satellite having the highest AQI among individual areas monitored by Safar.Mukesh Kumar, AMC municipal commissioner said, ""Safar mobile app is to alert people. We have an Air Quality Monitoring task force. However, our analysis has shown that in the New West zone areas, air pollution is largely due to real estate construction activity.""A senior officer from Gujarat Pollution Control Board said that in the city there was a dust storm that led to increased pollution readings. Areas that show very poor AQI have a large vehicle population and open spaces that increase the density of dust particles.Interestingly, the Safar monitoring stations are situated among green areas for example the Safar station in Satellite is in ISRO which is surrounded by greenery, while the one in Bopal is again in ISRO Colony. The Safar-Air monitoring station for Ahmedabad's biggest dumpsite, Pirana, is also situated in one of the greenest lungs of the city - Gyaspur forestry plantation.

Water ATM soon at Bhandewadi,"Nagpur: Safe drinking water, which has been a far-off dream for thousands of people living around the Bhandewadi dumping yard, might come true soon.Responding favourably to their pleas, guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule has said that a potable water ATM will be set-up in the area. Speaking to TOI, Bawankule said that the plant would come-up at Bidgaon, which is barely a kilometer away from dumping site of city's municipal solid waste.Bawankule added that he plans to use funds procured from corporate social responsibility of some private companies. ""I have approached some and the final order should get passed in the coming ten days,"" he said. /According to the minister, the plant will cost around Rs 12 lakh and will be based on ultra-filtration technology. Similar to Reverse Osmosis (RO), ultrafiltration is a process which separates suspended solids, solutes and bacteria and viruses to produce water with high purity. Once the plant is set-up, Bawankule plans to hand it over to women self-help groups. ""Drinking water will be sold at a nominal price of Rs 5 for 20 litres. We want to ensure that clean drinking water reaches to every stratum,"" the minister added. In the last one year, Bawankule has dedicated such water filter ATMS at many villages in the region. TOI had earlier reported how against the packaged drinking water, these ATMs are providing safe and low-cost drinking water to many rurals. Bidgaon is one of the areas which is worst affected due to contamination of groundwater. Since years, residents have been suffering from various health problems relating to stomach, kidney, skin and other diseases like jaundice and typhoid.Recently, TOI had collected water samples from few borewells in the area and got them tested in a private laboratory. Results showed that some parameters were higher than permissible limits and the water was unsafe for drinking.On the minister's assurance, residents said that they have been hearing such promises since last 3-4 years. ""Since two years we are being told that a water ATM will come up in our area but nothing happened. Few years back, we demanded a drinking water pipeline but no steps were taken. Ministers only visit our area when elections are near,"" they said.Apart from water contamination, the health of these residents is also at stake due to toxic air. TOI has been repeatedly reporting how the massive air pollution caused due to burning of all kinds of waste. ""The minister's priority should also be to tackle this problem. We deserve to breathe clean air,"" they said.Bawankule was hopeful that the waste-to-energy plant will solve waste management problems at Bhandewadi. The real problem, however, is the existing over 100 crore kilograms of solid waste which is frequently on fire. ""We are exploring ways to get rid of it,"" said Bawankule.

Doctors had discussed NiV threat in Kerala,"KOCHI: Much before Nipah virus killed three persons in Kozhikode, health experts in state had been discussing about the increased threat of emerging, infectious disease, including Nipah virus, in Kerala.""There has been (at least) one new infection every year (since 1970) and 30 new infectious diseases over the past 20 years. The risk of an infectious disease outbreak is increasing in Kerala,"" said Dr Rakesh P S, centre for public health, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Kochi.He said that the probable reason for this situation could be the destruction of forest due to rapid urbanization. This has destroyed the natural habitat of animals and birds, including bats. /CNow, there is increased contact between man and animal. This increases the risk of many zoonotic diseases,"" he added.""This is just the beginning of the problem of infectious diseases the state is going to face,"" said Dr Sajith Kumar R, head, department of infectious diseases, Kottayam Medical College.Due to environmental contamination and ecological damaged, many of the exotic viruses, which can affect the population, is now a reality, he said. ""There are also vulnerabilities associated with overpopulation, overcrowding and migration and the state is battling water and air pollution, besides waste management,"" he added.Take the case of Nipah virus that existed in bats for centuries and this virus had not undergone an evolutionary change but now the infection is spreading due to ecological factors, said doctors. The virus first spread in Malaysia due to unplanned felling of pulp wood, which is the natural habitat for NiV-carrying bats and mismanagement of large piggeries. In Bangladesh and later West Bengal, the outbreak happened due to the increase in human-bat interactions. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
heart ailments,"Indore: About one per cent youngsters in Indore, below 35 years of age, are suffering from cardiac disease, experts say.The alarming figure was released by Indore branch of Cardiological Society of India (CSI) after the death of 21-year-old son of a senior BJP leader in Hyderabad on Wednesday. The incident prompted city-based doctors to shed light on increasing cases of heart attacks in youngsters. The experts highlighted signs and ways to prevent cardiac illness.""Indians suffer heart attack 8-10 years earlier than other ethnic groups. /About 30 lakh people in India die because of cardiovascular disease,"" CSI Indore branch president Dr Ulhas Mahajan told TOI. He said that around one per cent youngsters in Indore are suffering from heart-related ailments.""Tobacco consumption, family history, diabetes mainly lead to premature heart attack. Other important factors responsible for it are unhealthy lifestyle -- junk food, lack of exercise and sleep,"" Dr Mahajan said.Senior cardiologist at MY Hospital Dr AD Bhatnagar said, ""At MYH, we record around 150-200 cases monthly of heart attacks and of this, about 20 per cent people are below 40 years of age. The numbers of youngsters suffering from heart related ailments have increased to multifold in last 10 years and all credit goes to increasing consumption of tobacco, diabetes, hypertension and family history.""""If in young patients, we diagnose familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which is most common cause of pre-mature heart disease of genetic origin, we can prevent it in their siblings and children,"" Dr Bhatnagar added.On World Heart Day, Indus Health Plus had presented a survey, which indicated that there was a threefold rise in cardiovascular disease (CVD) among Indoreans as compared to last three years. Air pollution was leading cause of heart diseases as 35% of people were breathing polluted air, which is harmful to their lungs and indirectly affects the heart.According to Amol Naikawadi, Preventive Healthcare Specialist Indus Health Plus, ""In Indore, average age of heart patients from 40 - 45 years is coming down to late 20s and early 30s. Day-to-day lifestyle modifications and changes like jogging, stair climbing, healthy eating, playing outdoor game, etc. help in reducing risk of heart ailments"".

Gas chamber? Rising mercury drives ozone beyond safe limit,"New Delhi: Not just extreme heat, air pollution levels are also peaking in many parts of the city. Even ozone (O3) levels are beginning to cross the safe standard - PM2.5 concentrations are already nearly twice the safe limit at most locations. While the winter smog is visible to the naked eye, high O3 levels may be an indicator that concentrations of invisible gaseous pollutants like oxides of nitrogen (NOx) may be very high at many locations.TOI tracked eight-hour averages of O3 at various locations monitored by both the Delhi Pollution Control Committee and the Central Pollution Control Board. CPCB data, for example, indicated that average O3 levels peaked to more than 100 micrograms per cubic metres during the day at RK Puram on several days between May 15 and May 23. For example, on May 15, the average between 8 am and 4 pm was 105 \xB5g/m\xB3, 118 \xB5g/m\xB3 on May 20, 111 \xB5g/m\xB3 on May 21 and 119 \xB5g/m\xB3 on May 22. DPCC's line graph shows that at RK Puram, O3 peaks have been as high as 160 \xB5g/m\xB3 and 130 \xB5g/m\xB3; at Wazirpur-an industrial area - O3 levels peaked to 124 \xB5g/m\xB3 on May 16 and 106 \xB5g/m\xB3 on May 22. At Najafgarh, O3 crossed 200 \xB5g/m\xB3 on May 17 and May 22. The 24-hour PM2.5 averages also hovered between 100 and 150 \xB5g/m\xB3 at most locations, including RK Puram, Punjabi Bagh and Anand Vihar, as opposed to the safe standard of 60 \xB5g/m\xB3. Ground-level ozone (O3) that's currently wreaking havoc in certain parts of Delhi is created due to chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOX), volatile organic compounds (VOC) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the presence of sunlight and heat.""This only shows that the level of gaseous emissions is high in the city. /NOx acts as a catalyst in summer to create ozone. In fact, NOx emissions dissipate and cause ozone pollution even in areas that are not close to pollution sources, such as low traffic areas,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment. She added that ""ozone is a highly reactive gas, which can aggravate health complications even at considerably lower levels. Those with respiratory conditions and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder are particularly vulnerable. Across the world, both PM2.5 and O3 are key pollutants for smog alerts. Our research shows O3 levels are rising and even shifting to peripheral areas of the city over the years.""According to the America Lung Association, exposure to O3 can trigger immediate health impacts like shortness of breath, wheezing and coughing, asthma attacks, increased risk of respiratory infections, pulmonary inflammation, among others. Long-term impact include harm to the central nervous system, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and reproductive and developmental harm.A DPCC scientist told TOI, ""We usually see a peak in both PM and Ozone levels during this part of the year. It's a combined effect of local emissions, high temperatures and an after-effect of crop and forest fires in the neighbouring states. Those with respiratory discomfort should take care."" Locally, combustion sources like vehicles and industries may be contributing to high O3. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Residents urge Cidco, PCMC not to burn green waste","Navi Mumbai: The illegal burning of waste generated from civic gardens, instead of scientifically disposing it has irked the locals and activists in Panvel taluka. On Friday, the staff in charge of the Cidco Five Science Garden in sector 2, Kalamboli, had set a heap of trash inside the park on fire, leading to a lot of smoke and air pollution.""I have requested PCMC and Cidco to ensure that there is proper composting inside the gardens since that is the best way to take care of the solid waste which is mostly organic in nature inside the parks. /However, it is disturbing to see garden waste being burnt leading to smoke and air pollution,"" said activist Anarjit Chauhan.After being informed about the illegal burning of waste at the Five Sciences Garden, the activist was told by the PCMC gardens in-charge, Tejaswini Galande, that the Cidco authorities are looking after this park as it has still not been handed over to PCMC.The Cidco executive engineer at Kalamboli, Girish Raghuvanshi said. ""I will ask my officials to check if the waste had been set on fire. Then we will instruct the staffers to follow the proper procedure."" Chauhan added that composting is done in all NMMC parks and gardens and the same should be undertaken in Cidco and PCMC areas.Composting involves the digging of a pit in one corner of the garden where all the organic waste like leaves, twigs are put and then covered with earth. After a certain period of time, the waste turns into manure, which can again be recycled for the garden thereby leading to an eco-friendly procedure. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Measures to tackle air pollution can reduce 8.58L deaths: Study,"Nagpur: Every year in India, around 26.45% premature deaths (among people above 25 years) are due to air pollution from thermal power plants and industries. While most of the coal-fired plants are violating air pollution standards thanks to the extension on the already-missed deadline given by the central government, the compliance of the standards by the currently operating and under-construction plants can actually avoid 1.24 lakh premature deaths annually. Also, 8.58 lakh premature deaths and 40% pollution levels in India can be reduced if mitigation measures are implemented. This was revealed in the latest study by Louisiana State University (LSU) which pointed out that emission from thermal power plants is the largest single-point source of pollution in India. /At 22.62%, the highest premature mortality due to toxic emissions from power units was found to be in Chhattisgarh - a state which is often called the country's power hub, having the seventh-largest coal-fired power plant in the country (Korba Super Thermal Power Plant). TOI has been reporting on how Indians will continue to suffer for next few years as the power plants have got an extension to comply with environmental norms. While new power plants are all set to come up in various parts the country, the study concludes that cancelling the construction of proposed coal-fired power plants can save 26,000 lives. When it comes to premature mortality due to industrial air pollution, Delhi topped the list. The study attributes around 40% of premature deaths in the Capital to industrial sources. ""Not just the polluting sources in Delhi, even the industrial units in neighbouring areas like Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh contribute to the pre-mature deaths in the capital. Similarly, the power units of Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand are affecting Chattisgarh,"" said Sunil Dahiya, campaigner at Greenpeace India. The environmental group also contributed in the study.Based on a mathematical modelling, the study analysed 13 scenarios (see box) with current emissions in different sectors. ""Emission inventory for various sectors were clubbed with meteorological parameters and were then used to predict the PM2.5 emissions from different sources and their concentrations at various geographies. The PM2.5 data was then clubbed with population data to estimate the health risk,"" added Dahiya.As per the study, premature deaths associated with PM2.5 exposure are mainly due to cerebrovascular disease which takes away around 4.4 lakh lives every year. This is followed by ischemic heart disease which leads to approximately 4 lakh deaths and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which causes 1.8 lakh pre-mature deaths. About 10,000 people die prematurely of lung cancer. The total number of pre-mature deaths due to the deadly PM.25 are 10.04 lakhs in the country.The study further discloses that Uttar Pradesh witnesses the highest number of premature mortality with 2.3 lakh. Bihar and West Bengal are next in line with 1.2 lakh and 1 lakh deaths, respectively. The study substantiates that household air pollution continues to be a major threat to public health. Highest number of pre-mature deaths - 55.45% - are caused due to residential pollution. ""A majority of households in India use solid fuels for cooking instead of gas and electricity,"" the study states.As per the calculations, reducing the use of solid fuel in households by 50%, especially in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and the North-East can avoid 2.58 lakh deaths annually. During the study, concentrations of PM2.5 were found to be the highest in the Indo-Gangetic region, including northern and eastern India.Furthermore, if crop burning is completely abandoned, almost 55,000 premature deaths per year can be avoided. It also focuses on the air pollution caused by burning of municipal solid waste. ""Assuming that waste burning is reduced by 80%, 46,000 lives can be saved across the country,"" said Dahiya.He added that though India has formulated mitigation measures to avoid pollution, its time and target-bound implementation remains a big question mark. ""The need of the hour is to implement all the policies systematically in a time-bound manner,"" he said. Professor Hongliang Zhang, the author of the study, said that major policy measures should include reducing emissions from thermal power plants, instituting strong emissions standards for industries and reducing solid fuel use in households. ""Shifting to zigzag kilns in brickmaking and introducing stronger vehicular emissions standards is also needed,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Rajasthan youths fast losing battle against pollution,"JAIPUR: Delhi might take the centre stage when hazards of air pollution are discussed, but Rajasthan's air too offers people a host of environmental challenges.A recently released, Centre's report, says that Rajasthan is at the top in the list of states which is losing years of healthy life to premature death and suffering due to air pollution.When a 28-year-old person, reached hospital with symptoms of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the doctors were surprised while examining him concluding that his lungs capacity was just 40%. He was a non-smoker. Doctors tried to understand that atthis young age, COPD among non-smoker is an indication of environment getting more polluted causing serious diseases.""His functioning of lungs has gone down up to 40%. COPD is a disease which is irreversible. His condition will deteriorate further. /Earlier, there was a trend of COPD cases in the age above 40 years, but now more cases are reported in early age, which are less than 40 years. It is quite a dangerous sign,"" said Dr Narendra Khippal, professor, department of chest & respiratory diseases, Sawai Man Singh Medical College.COPD is one of the environmental pulmonary diseases result from inhalation of dusts, allergens, chemicals, gases, or environmental pollutants. Due to pollution, the lungs are continually exposed to the external environment and are susceptible to a host of environmental challenges. According to health experts, pathologic processes can involve any part of the lungs, including the airways (occupational asthma, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, toxic inhalations, air pollution-related illness, or byssinosis), lung parenchyma (pneumoconiosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or silicosis), Pleura (asbestos-related diseases).""The WHO estimates the population-attributable fraction of COPD related to occupational and environmental exposures to be about 20% (ie, COPD incidence and mortality would decline by about 20% if environmental exposures were reduced to zero),"" said Dr Khippal.Health experts claimed that death rate due to COPD is highest in the state when comparing with other states of the country. ""The study released by the health ministry on the Health of the Nation's States-a study of how the burden of disease has changed in Indian states from 1990 to 2016, shows that Rajasthan is at the top in the list of states which is losing years of healthy life to premature death and suffering due to air pollution,"" said Dr Virendra Singh, former professor (pulmonary medicine), Sawai Man Singh Medical College.Dr Singh said, ""There are many reasons for air pollution.

"Kolkata second-most polluted metro in country, says WHO","KOLKATA: The city is in the grip of severe air pollution that remains largely unassessed and so is its health impact. In 2017-18, the city's pollution levels rose faster than ever before because of an exponential growth in the number of vehicles, construction activities and biomass burning.A recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that Kolkata is the second-most polluted metropolis in the country, next only to Delhi. The study revealed another alarming trend - Kolkata's air quality is declining faster than Delhi's.The biggest threat to citizens' health is posed by particulate matter pollution, particularly PM2.5. There has been a tremendous rise in number of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases) patients in the city. /It causes much of fatalities. Dr Arup Halder, consultant pulmonologist, wondered why the city so patiently accepted the grave situation without even a murmur of protest. ""Do we really care for our kids? If we do, how can we allow them to breathe poison every minute?"" he said.Kolkata has earned the notoriety of being the India's lung cancer capital. As many as 70% citizens suffer from respiratory disorders due to air pollution. Besides, there are cases of haematological abnormalities, impaired liver function, genetic changes and neuro-behavioral problems. According to Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and National Centre for Atmospheric Research, air pollution has reduced life expectancy of Kolkatans by 6.1years, second to Delhi's 6.4 years.However, there is hardly any detailed study to assess the impact of degrading ambient air on Kolkatans' health. A joint study by Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, state's department of environment and Central Pollution Control Board in 1995 had estimated 10, 647 premature deaths due to air pollution in Kolkata.The recent study said nitrogen oxide, another major pollutant, exceeds standards by1.8 times. This also contributes to ozone pollution. ""These two pollutants are responsible for major increase in mortality from chronic bronchitis and pneumonia,"" said Dr Debasish Basu, a preventive medicine expert.While Kolkata's air quality is often compared to that of Delhi - considered one of the most polluted cities in the world - pulmonologists and respiratory physicists said it was meaningless as 28 automated air quality monitoring stations functioned in Delhi - giving a clear picture of the city's ambient air quality - whereas the only two stations that Kolkata had did not even function. ""Citizens' health issue has been severely compromised,"" said Ajay Mittal of Kolkata Clean Air Campaign. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Bandra residents reclaim a garden,"Nestled among the jungle of tall buildings, rests a small green, gated park - the MCGM D'Monte Road Garden, Bandra. What makes this space special is that this local citizen initiative endeavours to be a model for sustainable green space in our city.Come Sunday evenings, and you will get to see an enthusiastic group of around 15-20 residents, aged anywhere between seven to 75 years, throng the park. They bring along their shovels, spades, rakes, garden forks, watering cans, shears, axe, sickle and other tools and immerse themselves in working on it.How did it begin?It all began just a couple of months ago, when homemaker and environment enthusiast Marie Paul, under her self-expression leadership programme (SELP) thought of reviving the park next door. ""My intentions were out in the universe and things just fell into place. /I started meeting like-minded individuals and we formed a group - all of us were passionate about doing our bit for the environment.""The residents ALM (area local management) had adopted the park from the BMC 15 years ago but a few years back it went back to the BMC. Recently, the environment-conscious residents went to the officials and got a go-ahead from them. ""The BMC has been extremely supportive. Asif Zakaria, the corporator and Mr Munde from the garden department of Bandra, have been helpful. They have got us red mud, given us a maali and a gurkha to look after the garden daily,"" says Marie.Age no bar at this environment projectAmong the homemakers, children, working professionals and retired people, there are also kids as young as six in this group, and together they pick up the dried leaves from nearby societies and building compounds and get them to the garden. The group is inspired by the Save A Leaf campaign (activists stop dried fallen leaves from being burnt and give the dried leaves back to the soil).What is the project?The volunteers in the last few months have demonstrated that sustainable low-cost green spaces are possible in the city. Premila Martis, an environmentalist (she is a part of the Urban Leaves in Matunga and was active with the saving leaf campaign) who stays near the park in Bandra, is helping the group to use the local natural resources to build soil and grow edibles in the garden. She says, ""By burning dried leaves we only add to the air pollution, greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Bio-degradable waste like leaves should never be treated as garbage nor should they go to landfills. So, we collect dried leaves and layer them on the garden soil. By spreading leaves, we are mimicking forest soil, which is alive with insects, nutrients, moisture and so sustains itself. You don't need to buy fertiliser when nature is already giving it. We have been feeding the soil here, cow dung solution and slurry, for microbes. Now in the rains, nature will do its job... ""Environmentalists like her believe that leaves that fall from trees protect the roots, keep the tree free from diseases and are necessary to create a soil that is rich in nutrients. ""We put leaves back to where they belong - on the ground, into the soil,"" adds Marie. Dipti Jhangiani, who is studying urban farming since the last couple of years, says, ""I am all for utilising the biomass which is wasted in our city e.g. the hay in mango boxes, sugarcane bagasse, and dried leaves. These can build soil.""Working as a teamOnce they gather in the garden, they divide into groups and take up specific jobs - while some trim branches and cut down bamboo trees, others make trellises for creepers. A few get together to make a slurry with cow dung and water that is used to feed the soil around the trees. There are some who clean the stacks of dried leaves brought in by others to make sure it is plastic and garbage free. There are a few who create beds for community vegetables while others harvest fruits and vegetable trees and plants.This project is not just about the garden...For Ayesha Atar, a teacher and a resident of D'Monte Park Road, Bandra, who joined this group along with her husband and twins Myrah and Ana, this weekend activity means more. ""This is a great way to meet and interact with different people. Kids get to meet other children their age. We learn so much about the environment.""The residents support this activity as a community act. Most of the young parents in the group want to let their kids know what it takes to grow their own food - digging in the dirt, layering biomass on the soil, mulching, composting and basically having fun without gadgets.Jai Martis, 17, a tenth grader, loves to come to the park because of multiple reasons, the primary one being, that it is a hard project. ""In our city, we are not used to doing things like these. And that is the reason why I admire everyone who comes to work in the park and gives their time. The other reasons are that this rather quiet part of Bandra, gets quite fun and noisy on Sunday evenings because all of us gather here and work at the garden. We meet people of all ages, the work is fun and invigorating.""Mani Patel, who lives in a bungalow nearby, says she likes to learn about different ways to use garden waste and gardening in this project. This silver-haired sprightly lady loves to meet different people, ""What I really like is that I see a lot of kids coming here and learning, just like I am. And that is fun.""Hemlata Malani, another local resident adds, ""We do our bit of gardening and composting at home but this project was on a bigger scale. It is about putting everything that comes from the trees back into the soil and make it better.""The group is also into harvesting of the fruits and vegetables that they grow there. ""We pluck the mulberry, Bilimbi, banana and share it. People get fruits or snacks also from home and after a hard days work in the garden, they sit down and devour the snacks.""People are eager to be a part of this project because of this great community feeling and Zeba, a Bandra resident since the last eight years, joined recently for the same reason. She says, ""I was working on the Carter Road clean-up project which stopped a few months ago and I really wanted to meet people and be a part of the community here. I am into healthy eating and growing my own herbs and vegetables.""Unique ways adopted to build the green spaceEvery weekend, the group, which is in touch on Whatsapp over the week, gathers at the park to go about their plan of turning this garden into an organic, natural, self-sufficient, green space that yields multiple kinds of fruits and vegetables for the residents nearby. They have tugged around large bedsheets full of dried, discarded leaves and brought them to the garden. Ayesha says, ""One day I was tugging the green garbage trolley stuffed with dried leaves towards the garden, and had people staring at me. I then realised that I was still in my salsa shoes!""Keeping in mind the fact that shortage of water is a big issue - the residents have made their garden self-reliant. Due to their efforts, their 'Dream Grove' as they have named it, does not need extra water, nor chemical fertilisers or pesticides. This garden survives on much less water, has healthier trees and plants.Every building in the city can do thisAfter a few months of hard work and the positive results, the enthusiastic volunteers feel that every building and bungalow owner can do this - cover the open soil with leaves. People can avoid burning dried leaves or throwing biomass in the garbage. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Shahjahani Park garbage dump row reaches NGT,"BHOPAL: The principal bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) based at New Delhi has issued notices to the state government, MP Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) and Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) seeking response to a petition against the use of historic Yadgar-e-Shahjahani Park for garbage dumping and proposal to set up a bio-gas plant in the park. Aagney Sail, counsel for activist Abdul Jabbar, who has filed the petition, not only sought that garbage dumping in the park be stopped immediately and construction of bio-gas plant stalled, but also asked the tribunal to impose exemplary fine on the respondents for not only shirking their duty to maintain the park of historical relevance and creating health hazard to the residents of surrounding areas, including patients of two hospitals located just across the road.The petition further said that BMC workers burn solid waste dumped in the park causing air pollution in the area, leading to choking, eye irritation, skin rashes and other diseases. Besides, food cooked at Deendayal Kitchen may also get severely contaminated by the smoke arising out of burning of waste.Apart from this, two major hospitals - Sultania Zanana and Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital are also affected by the noxious fumes emanating from the waste heap, counsel for the petitioner contended.The petitioner also pointed out that the garbage dumping site, where the construction of a bio-gas plant is being carried out, was a playground and it was duly declared so, when a night shelter home (rainbasera), Deendayal Kitchen and a public toilet was constructed on the north side of the plant and authorities had assured him that the playground would be shifted to the open space. /But, the bio-gas plant is now being constructed at the spot without proper notification and amendments in land use.Sail further contended that there has been a non-adherence to the existing guidelines provided under Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules, 2016, while selecting the dump site and bio-gas plant project. He also said that no scientific research was carried out to test the feasibility of solid waste dumping and even the minimum professional standards have been maintained.The petition alleged that no prior permission under the Municipal Solid Waste Rules 2016; Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981; Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 have been sought for setting up of the bio-gas plant.Besides, respondents have been oblivious to various representations and reminders given to them, urging to shift the dumping site and bio-gas plant to arrest the environmental degradation.

Docs have hands full as city gasps for air,"New Delhi: The spike in pollution levels in the city over the last few days has left many people, especially those with pre-existing respiratory problems, gasping for air. Many of them, doctors told TOI, had been calling them to ask for ways to deal with the situation.""I have been getting four to five calls daily this week. Patients complain about difficulty breathing, sore throat and wheezing,"" Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, respiratory medicine at Apollo hospital, said. /He added that many ""healthy"" people were also complaining about difficulty in breathing and chest tightness.The most common advice doctors offer to such patients is to remain indoors when the air outside is dangerously polluted. ""Earlier, it was said that air pollution peaks in winter or on Diwali, but now it has become a year-long problem for Delhi. If urgent action is not taken to tackle the situation, we might have to leave the city to save life,"" said Piyush Sharma, a resident of Malviya Nagar. His six-year-old daughter, Sharma said, had been down with sore throat and fever for two days.Dr R K Singhal, principal consultant and director of internal medicine division at BLK Super Speciality hospital, said for people with respiratory conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), even small increases in dust concentration could make their symptoms worse.Dust particles small enough to be inhaled may cause irritation of the eyes, coughing, sneezing, hay fever and asthma attacks, he added. Dr Vikramjeet Singh, senior consultant, Internal Medicine, Aakash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital, said to prevent the effects of dust pollution, it was recommended that people wore masks when going out.The acute effects of high pollution are visible. But its chronic effects are invisible and more disastrous in the long term. It is known to affect lung growth in children, chronic bronchitis and increase incidence of heart diseases among others, say experts. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Haze in Punjab causes worst air quality in last 10 years,"PATIALA: Punjab is experiencing its worst air quality in the last 10 years as cyclonic circulation over northwest Madhya Pradesh coupled with a trough extending from northwest Rajasthan to Bihar has thrown up dust from the Thar desert into the atmosphere.Taking cognisance of severe air pollution, Haryana, too has issued an advisory.Dust particles that engulfed the entire region from Wednesday afternoon has pushed the state's Ambient Air Quality (AQI) to the severest category, even higher than the pollution levels that persist during the stubble burning ahead of winters, every year.Going by the figures recorded at the continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations across the state, most parts of Punjab have an AQI between 459 micrograms/m3 to over 500 micrograms/m3. The AQI of Amritsar has been recorded at 459 micrograms/m3 and in Khanna at 491 micrograms/ m3. At Ludhiana, the AQI was 488 micrograms/m3 and at Mandi Gobindgarh at 500 micrograms/m3.Dust particles in air causing major respiratory problemsAt Ropar, AQI was 471 micrograms/m3 and the CAAQMS at Patiala and Jalandhar could not collect even data to compute the AQI.The PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels were also found to be alarmingly high since Wednesday afternoon. The figures reveal that the air pollution across the state is worse than the days when paddy stubble is set on fire ahead of the winters, each year. /In November 2017, when paddy residue was being burnt across the state, the AQI monitors were reflecting readings of 320 micrograms/m3 at Amritsar, 332 micrograms/m3 at Ludhiana and 371 micrograms/m3 at Mandi Gobindgarh, which was in a very poor category.Before the dust storm, the AQI at Amritsar was recorded at 131 micrograms/m3, at Khanna it was 111, at Jalandhar it was 96 and at Ludhiana, it was 139 micrograms/m3. At Mandi Gobindgarh, the reading was 258 micrograms/m3 and in Patiala and Ropar it was recorded at 80 and 106 micrograms/m3, respectively.The dust particles hanging in the atmosphere are also causing respiratory problems. As per WHO, the AQI up to 50 micrograms/m3 is considered to be good with minimal impact on human health, up to 100 micrograms/m3 it can cause minor breathing problems to sensitive people. An AQI in the range of 101 to 200 micrograms/m3 is kept in the moderate category and can cause breathing discomfort to people with respiratory issues and up to 300, the AQI is said to be poor which can cause problems for healthy people on prolonged exposure. When the AQI rises above 301 to 400 micrograms/ m3 it can cause respiratory problems amongst health individuals and above 400 micrograms/m3, it starts having a serious impact on the human health.KS Pannu, the chairman of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), said the rise in pollution had been caused by a natural phenomenon. He said inputs received from the meteorological department suggest that the dust would settle down by Friday afternoon as the region is expected to receive rains. He said the PPCB had already issued an advisory to the residents that people with acute respiratory problems should avoid venturing out during the poor air quality and they should also avoid sporting and other activities till the weather returns to normal.

Gurugram sees most polluted day since November haze,"GURUGRAM: The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) issued a temporary ban on all construction activity in the city for the following 48 hours, after Gurugram was declared the most polluted city in the Delhi-NCR region on Thursday, following steep rise in pollution over the past three days in the wake of dust storms from Rajasthan and beyond.The city witnessed unusually high levels of PM2.5. The highest level of PM2.5 recorded was 617 micrograms per cubic metre (\xB5g/m\xB3), while air quality index (AQI) hit 485 (considered 'Severe'). The AQI in Delhi, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Noida, in comparison, were 431 (Severe), 317 (Very Poor), 384 (Very Poor) and 390 (Very Poor) respectively.Thursday was not only the most polluted day of the year so far, but also the most polluted since November 2017. The pollution was so high, it was 100% more than that recorded during Diwali every year since they began to be recorded. For example, PM2.5 was 301\xB5g/m\xB3 on Diwali, October 19. The city witnessed its highest PM2.5 level ever, at 727\xB5g/m\xB3, on November 3 the same year.According to HSPCB officials, this is an emergency situation and they have implemented the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). ""Sudden increase in PM10 and PM2.5 has raised air pollution level to 'Severe Plus' category in the past 24 hours, as has been observed by our monitoring network. /It is learnt that this is an outcome of the dust storm and winds coming from regions of Rajasthan and beyond. We have, therefore, issued instructions to shut all construction activities in the city for the next 48 hours,"" said Shakti Singh, regional officer, HSPCB (south).HSPCB has also sent an advisory to the district administration, MCG and other civic authorities to implement GRAP measures. ""Ensure frequent sprinkling of water in all places that require it, to help the dust settle; deploy special teams to ensure strict vigil on garbage burning activities; increase frequency of mechanised cleaning of roads and ensure that operations of all hot mix plants and stone crushers under your jurisdiction are stopped for the next 48 hours,"" states a letter (a copy is with TOI) sent by HSPCB to the civic authorities and district administration.Experts called for immediate action at both local and regional levels. ""Very strong winds are blowing over large expanse of area, which is leading to a sudden spike in the level of particulate matter. There is a need to take action at both levels. While local authorities should implement dust suppression measures and all norms stated under GRAP, it is important for the regional authorities to protect forests and increase green cover, as vegetation helps prevent sand drifting from Rajasthan to Delhi-NCR areas,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhary, executive director (policy and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment.

City's air pollution at hazardous levels,"Surat: Residents in the Diamond City run the risk of serious health problems from the high levels of particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere thanks to industrial emissions and noxious fumes of vehicles, particularly in the last two years. Gujarat Pollution Control Board's (GPCB) annual PM10 data of 2017-18 shows that the particle pollution recorded from 10 locations in the city was much higher than national average. The mean of particulate matter at two locations at Pandesara, which houses the textile mills, is 174 and 184 per micrograms per cubic meter of air (ug/m3) per annum as against the national average of 100 ug/m3. Sachin, which houses over 50 textile mills, has the highest mean of 188 UG/M3 followed by Delhi Gate at 164 ug/m3, Garden Silk Mills at 184 ug/m3 etc. The PM10 levels in the Diamond City in 2015-16 was in the average of 90 ug/m3.GPCB officials said apart from vehicular pollution, air pollution from textile mills was mainly responsible for higher particle pollution in the Diamond City. Anil Patel, vigilance officer, GPCB, told TOI, ""We have made emission monitoring system mandatory for all textile units. It is directly connected to GPCB. /The moment the pollution exceeds the prescribed limit, we come to know. I have issued notices to 36 textile mills in the past six months for violating pollution norms. Textile mills causing air pollution must be moved out of residential zones to protect the health of the residents.""Many residents living near the textile mills have breathing problems, asthma and lung-related diseases.Paresh Ghaswala is a resident of Rustompura. Krishnaram Textile Mill is located in the area. He said, ""My wife is suffering from severe asthma for the last 10 years. The doctor has advised us to change the house, but there are no buyers."" In the walled city area of Varachha and Pandesara, the PM10 levels are exceedingly high at 184 ug/m3. Particulate matter pollution is made up of tiny particles - the tiniest are about 30 times smaller than the width of hair - that come from vehicles, factories, biomass combustion and construction dust etc. They can penetrate deep into our lungs, and cause heart and lung diseases in us. Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), created by Energy Policy Institute at University of Chicago, presents the effect of particulate matter on lifespans around the world, calculating how many life years could be saved if local governments meet the World Health Organization's (WHO) and their own national standards for air pollution. The AQLI is based on the results of a new study of pollution and life expectancy near Huai River in China, published last year in the proceedings of National Academy of Sciences. The study isolated the effect of air pollution on lifespans, revealing that an increase of 10 micrograms of PM10 (particulate matter that is 10 micrometers or less in diameter) per cubic meter of air (ug/m3) reduces life expectancy by 0.64 years.Also, the WHO has set the standard of PM 2.5 at 10 ug/m3 and its implementation may help increase the lifespan in cities. However, Surat's annual average PM 2.5 level at 50 ug/m3 is frightening. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Guerrilla gardening takes root in Mumbai,"Exhausted with the overbearing grey concrete that is creeping up on the city like some futuristic horror film, a growing number of people have decided to do their bit to cultivate little green utopias, sometimes as rebel gardeners. These 'guerrilla gardeners'-who get activated just before monsoon-range from a dentist who seed-bombs forests neighbouring Mumbai to a yoga instructor who surreptitiously plants tree saplings wherever she can find a free spot in her neighbourhood. Their small interventions are reminiscent of the 'guerrilla gardening' movement that started in London some years ago, where citizens roamed around identifying abandoned spaces and cultivating them when no one was looking.""Just before monsoon, we fly a four-seater aircraft over a 200-mile radius outside Mumbai and scatter seeds over areas that we can see are deforested or strip-mined,"" says Dr Firdaus Batiwala, who has encouraged other members of the Bombay Flying Club to do the same. ""The best way to do it is to create a seed ball of clay and manure embedded with seeds. /When you throw it, and the seed sprouts and the survival rate is much better because it has its nutrition from the ball in the initial few weeks. It's an old Japanese technique.""With the help of Sanctuary Asia magazine and Bhavan's zoology professor Parvish Pandya, Batiwala has been procuring indigenous seeds-kanchan, Indian teak, bor-because they manage to grow in adverse conditions where the top soil is lost or the land is in bad shape, and where the more finicky species may not grow, he says. Many of Mumbai's ubiquitous trees are not native-gulmohar came from Madagascar and rain tree from Jamaica-and were brought by British botanists.The idea of creating new ecosystems around native trees sparked an interest in Malad-based businessman Vikas Mahajan several years ago. He formed an informal group called Friends For Reviving Our Green Earth.Green warriors go in for seed-bombingMembers of Mahajan's group regularly seed-bomb outside the city. Mahajan also conducts free workshops to teach children how to wash and dry seeds after they have eaten fruits-oranges, lemons, chikoos and mangoes. ""We show them how seeds can be a treasure, not garbage,"" says Mahajan, who designs school science labs. ""Basically everyone has to work for nature.""While seed-bombing works best outside the city, guerrilla gardeners working within Mumbai take the slightly more involved saplings route. A few weeks ago, eco-entrepreneur Savitha Rao planted the first of a mini-city forest in a park in Goregaon. Her organisation Keshav Srushti aims to create 100 city forests using native species of trees, shrubs and herbs, which tend to be more resistant to pests and disease. ""We plant them intelligently so that two trees do not compete for the same resources. The idea is to make them self-sufficient ecosystems. These also bring in diverse species of birds, not just crows and pigeons,"" says Rao.""Air pollution has become a serious problem and trees are the best air purifiers. You can choose the food and water you consume, but you cannot choose the air you will breathe. As human beings we can still take precautions, but what about animals and birds? Can a puppy or a sparrow put on an air mask? When a cow breathes polluted air all the time, will it not impact the quality of milk which is then consumed by us?"" asks Rao.Breach Candy-based guerilla gardener Nisha Mulchandani, a yoga instructor, has been planting trees for years, many of which have now grown to towering heights. ""Every year, when Nana Chudasama used to distribute free saplings just before monsoon, I would just go and pick them up, pile them into my car, and plant them wherever I saw a spot of earth. The problem is that now every thing is cemented so it is difficult to find spaces,"" she says, bemoaning the number of trees that are being indiscriminately hacked. ""A tree takes time to come up but it takes a minute to chop it. The tree pose (vrukshasana) is an important posture in yoga... we forget that we are so intimately connected to nature.""Indeed, if trees are viewed not as impediments to human civilisation but as interactive beings that follow their own woody etiquette, the similarities are endless. German forester Peter Wohlleben, who wrote the enchanting book 'The Hidden Life of Trees', suggests that trees communicate with one another just like people. There are mature well-behaved ones who are the ""upright members of ancient forests"" and there are those that hog resources. But unlike human beings in their current destructive avatar, trees believe in community, help each other via their network of roots or through scent or signals sent out via leaves, and are part of a woodwide web that may have somewhat more lasting significance than the worldwide web.As environmentalist Bittu Sahgal says, ""In the wild, the best seed-planters are the creatures large and small. In our cities, where we have edged out the natural seed dispersers, we must step in. Guerrilla gardening is just the thing our cities need and where we are likely to find the least resistance is on the largest vacant spaces available-the thousands of desertified rooftops of our green-starved cities.""

Guerrilla gardening takes root in Mumbai,"Exhausted with the overbearing grey concrete that is creeping up on the city like some futuristic horror film, a growing number of people have decided to do their bit to cultivate little green utopias, sometimes as rebel gardeners. These 'guerrilla gardeners'-who get activated just before monsoon-range from a dentist who seed-bombs forests neighbouring Mumbai to a yoga instructor who surreptitiously plants tree saplings wherever she can find a free spot in her neighbourhood. Their small interventions are reminiscent of the 'guerrilla gardening' movement that started in London some years ago, where citizens roamed around identifying abandoned spaces and cultivating them when no one was looking.""Just before monsoon, we fly a four-seater aircraft over a 200-mile radius outside Mumbai and scatter seeds over areas that we can see are deforested or strip-mined,"" says Dr Firdaus Batiwala, who has encouraged other members of the Bombay Flying Club to do the same. ""The best way to do it is to create a seed ball of clay and manure embedded with seeds. /When you throw it, and the seed sprouts and the survival rate is much better because it has its nutrition from the ball in the initial few weeks. It's an old Japanese technique.""With the help of Sanctuary Asia magazine and Bhavan's zoology professor Parvish Pandya, Batiwala has been procuring indigenous seeds-kanchan, Indian teak, bor-because they manage to grow in adverse conditions where the top soil is lost or the land is in bad shape, and where the more finicky species may not grow, he says. Many of Mumbai's ubiquitous trees are not native-gulmohar came from Madagascar and rain tree from Jamaica-and were brought by British botanists.The idea of creating new ecosystems around native trees sparked an interest in Malad-based businessman Vikas Mahajan several years ago. He formed an informal group called Friends For Reviving Our Green Earth.Green warriors go in for seed-bombingMembers of Mahajan's group regularly seed-bomb outside the city. Mahajan also conducts free workshops to teach children how to wash and dry seeds after they have eaten fruits-oranges, lemons, chikoos and mangoes. ""We show them how seeds can be a treasure, not garbage,"" says Mahajan, who designs school science labs. ""Basically everyone has to work for nature.""While seed-bombing works best outside the city, guerrilla gardeners working within Mumbai take the slightly more involved saplings route. A few weeks ago, eco-entrepreneur Savitha Rao planted the first of a mini-city forest in a park in Goregaon. Her organisation Keshav Srushti aims to create 100 city forests using native species of trees, shrubs and herbs, which tend to be more resistant to pests and disease. ""We plant them intelligently so that two trees do not compete for the same resources. The idea is to make them self-sufficient ecosystems. These also bring in diverse species of birds, not just crows and pigeons,"" says Rao.""Air pollution has become a serious problem and trees are the best air purifiers. You can choose the food and water you consume, but you cannot choose the air you will breathe. As human beings we can still take precautions, but what about animals and birds? Can a puppy or a sparrow put on an air mask? When a cow breathes polluted air all the time, will it not impact the quality of milk which is then consumed by us?"" asks Rao.Breach Candy-based guerilla gardener Nisha Mulchandani, a yoga instructor, has been planting trees for years, many of which have now grown to towering heights. ""Every year, when Nana Chudasama used to distribute free saplings just before monsoon, I would just go and pick them up, pile them into my car, and plant them wherever I saw a spot of earth. The problem is that now every thing is cemented so it is difficult to find spaces,"" she says, bemoaning the number of trees that are being indiscriminately hacked. ""A tree takes time to come up but it takes a minute to chop it. The tree pose (vrukshasana) is an important posture in yoga... we forget that we are so intimately connected to nature.""Indeed, if trees are viewed not as impediments to human civilisation but as interactive beings that follow their own woody etiquette, the similarities are endless. German forester Peter Wohlleben, who wrote the enchanting book 'The Hidden Life of Trees', suggests that trees communicate with one another just like people. There are mature well-behaved ones who are the ""upright members of ancient forests"" and there are those that hog resources. But unlike human beings in their current destructive avatar, trees believe in community, help each other via their network of roots or through scent or signals sent out via leaves, and are part of a woodwide web that may have somewhat more lasting significance than the worldwide web.As environmentalist Bittu Sahgal says, ""In the wild, the best seed-planters are the creatures large and small. In our cities, where we have edged out the natural seed dispersers, we must step in. Guerrilla gardening is just the thing our cities need and where we are likely to find the least resistance is on the largest vacant spaces available-the thousands of desertified rooftops of our green-starved cities.""

"Soon, vertical gardens to be developed on flyover pillars","PATNA: The Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited (BRPNNL) will soon develop vertical gardens on the pillars of all flyovers in the city. A beginning in this regard has been made with the development of a vertical garden on pillar number 89 of the Jagdeopath-Sheikhpura Mor flyover.""At least 2,000 varieties of plants, including haze, snake plants, dracaena mahatma, jasmine and song of India, were used in the vertical garden developed on a trial basis on pillar number 89. While the plants were procured from Kolkata, the pots were brought from Pune,"" BRPNNL engineer Sunil Kumar told this newspaper.Vertical gardens are quite common in metropolitan cities like New Delhi and Bengaluru. /They absorb carbon dioxide from the environment, clean the polluted air and act as a natural sound proofing barrier.Plans are afoot to develop vertical gardens on Station Road and Exhibition Road flyovers. ""We will issue expression of interest (EoI) for inviting firms interested in developing vertical gardens on all the pillars of the Jagdedopath-Sheikhpura Mor flyover,"" Sunil said.Patna was marked the fifth most polluted city in the world in terms of PM 2.5 concentration, according to a global air pollution database released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in May this year. PM 2.5 is the level of ultra-fine particles of less than 2.5 microns which invade human lungs and cause serious health problems, including cancer.According to experts, walls on which vertical gardens are erected show a drop of 1-2 degrees, proving that the measure is an effective way of combating temperature.

Delhi HC stays cutting of trees for govt projects till July 4,"NEW DELHI: Stepping into the raging controversy over felling of thousands of trees in south Delhi for redevelopment of government housing projects, the Delhi high court on Monday stayed any further tree-cutting till July 4, when it will hear the matter next.""Can Delhi afford cutting of trees for the development of roads and buildings? We could understand if it was a road-widening work (in) which (treecutting) is inevitable,"" said a bench of Justices Vinod Goel and Rekha Palli, acting on a petition by a city-based orthopaedic, Dr Kaushal Kant Mishra.Claiming that removal of the trees will amount to ""statesponsored death"", the petition said environmental clearances (ECs) granted for the projects had given the go-ahead for ""complete decimation"" of almost 20,000 trees. The Centre, however, argued that the clearances were in accordance with earlier orders of the National Green Tribunal.'Planting of saplings can't substitute for trees killed'The petitioner's lawyers, Shrutanjaya Bharadwaj and Jayant Mehta, also pointed out that that the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act limits the cutting of trees in the city.Standing counsel Ripudaman Bhardwaj, appearing for the ministries of environment and housing, said the ECs for the projects given by the Centre were in accordance with law.Senior counsel J P Seng, appearing for the developer, National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC), informed the court that the corporation had also deposited Rs 8 crore as compensation for felling the trees.During the hearing, the petitioner's counsel said their plea needed to be slightly amended because the issue also involved permission for felling given in November 2017 by the tree authority of the Delhi government and this decision could not be challenged in the NGT.The HC, as a result, gave time to the petitioner till July 4 to amend the plea.The petition was filed through advocate Gopal Sankaranarayan and the two other lawyers. /It argued that the trees slated to be cut were much-needed sources of oxygen and waterrecharge in the city. The ""poor excuse"" of planting saplings at a different location would be absolutely no substitute for the trees ""killed"" today, it added.As per the WHO, the petition claimed, Delhi was ranked 1 on particulate matter levels (PM 10 and PM 2.5) among all mega cities (populations over 14 million) in the world. ""As urban air quality declines, the risk of stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma, increases for the people who live there,"" it said. In this scenario, to further worsen the situation by removing the city's green cover borders not on mere negligence but almost ""state-sponsored death"", it said.Delhi had been declared an ""air pollution-control area"" more than 30 years ago and that all activity needed to bear this in mind, the plea stated. It added that all actions of the Supreme Court, high court and the NGT on improving the city's air quality would be frustrated if such ""state-sanctioned"" destruction were to be permitted.In Sarojini Nagar for example, 11,000 out of 13,128 trees are to be cut, while in Kasturba Nagar, all 520 trees are to be removed, without leaving even one standing. No amount of landscaping and tree planting can properly compensate for the loss of precious green cover, the plea added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Summer heat and 'false hopes of some return',"Calcutta. 22.5726\xB0 north, 88.3639\xB0 east on a map. Less than a hundred kilometres south of the Tropic of Cancer passing through Purulia, Bankura, Burdwan and Nadia. ToC is the most northerly latitude on Earth at which the sun can be directly overhead, occurring on the June solstice, summer solstice, which was a few days ago. /The Tropic itself is a shifting latitude relative to the equator because of the tilt of the Earth's axis over the days. This year our summer was hijacked by rain. The kalbaishakhis which stormed for far too many days than my imperfect memory can remember from years gone by. It is somehow appropriate that even as the monsoon was officially declared to have set in to our lands early this month, we have spent excruciating days in blistering heat since. Nature is constantly doing a juggling, balancing act. Not always in our favour.The online Encyclopaedia Britannica says of Calcutta, ""The low, swampy, hot, and humid riverbank otherwise has little to recommend it."" Trust the Brits to have founded the second city of the Empire in exactly such a place! And now there's no going back. Unpredictable kalbaishakhis, fiery summers, a drowning monsoon and a tepid winter are what we now must live with. Apart from a host of other things.The first private Indian weather monitoring and forecasting company almost gleefully tells us to look forward to Kolkata being the most heat-stressed city in the world for the rest of the century. Heat wave conditions have been progressively rising in India and 2016 was the hottest year since 1901. Global warming and population growth are the leading causes for heat stress which is measured by using the heat index which includes both humidity and air temperature. The real feel. The one saving grace is that this private weather forecaster has been wrong in the past with other predictions. Will that make Calcutta any cooler?Even if the monsoon has meteorologically opened its innings for us, it is kind of stranded in the Bay. But June has always been a severe summer month. So when we moan and groan about the weather this time (as we do every time) let's remember June from four years ago when temperatures reached highs of 40\xB0C over three or four consecutive days. By the look of things, especially things like concrete, steel and glass high-rises being built randomly, illogically, like the filling up of water bodies and the rapidly shrinking tree cover, Calcutta is going to heat stress out much more than we might want in the immediate future. The century-old brick and mortar house where I live in one of the most congested areas of the city is still liveable without an air-conditioner. The new building opposite me which has replaced a similar building like mine has ACs fitted in every room in every apartment. Imagine the unmeasurable pollution conditions being created every summer when almost everyone with an AC is running it at full blast at the same time. Large residential complexes, offices, malls, all over the city, the outskirts, the suburbs... It boggles the mind.Nonetheless, the highest temperature ever recorded at Alipore was 43.9\xB0C in a 1924 June. The 1st, to be precise. This year's almost 41 degrees with a real feel of 50 is a comfort in comparison. And there wasn't any concrete, steel and glass. Air pollution must have been in the nascent stages. Which Rudyard Kipling more or less wrote of in his City of Dreadful Night in 1888, in the first chapter's very first page, ""Calcutta holds out false hopes of some return. The dense smoke hangs low, in the chill of the morning, over an ocean of roofs, and, as the city wakes, there goes up to the smoke a deep, full-throated boom of life and motion and humanity. For this reason does he who sees Calcutta for the first time hang joyously out of the ticca gharri and sniff the smoke, and turn his face toward the tumult, saying: 'This is, at last, some portion of my heritage returned to me. This is a city. There is life here, and there should be all manner of pleasant things for the having, across the river and under the smoke.'""Calcutta gets an average of 13 sunlight hours every day between April and August. We should be learning from that fact. I wonder what?Phu Ning Ding is a legendary altered-folkroots pop artiste and folk instrumentalist from Diphu, Karbi Anglong in the northeast. He formed a folk rock band Warklung in 1999, the first of its kind in that region.

"Long hours, air pollution, no shifts: Who's thinking about traffic cops' health?","GURUGRAM: Six traffic cops huddled to share a meal in a pota cabin on Saturday noon near Iffco Chowk, one of the busiest junctions in the city. Most traffic cops eat brunch, their first meal since 7am when they report to work, around noon. A senior traffic cop said, ""Last night, we had to be part of an anti-drink drive till 3am after managing the heavy Friday traffic till 9pm."" Another cop said, ""We don't get enough sleep, most days. /After coming to work at 7am, we have to stay till the traffic thins out at the end of the day. This can take up to 8.30pm or 9pm."" Traffic cops told TOI they did not have shifts or specific timings for work. On Thursday, a 42-year-old ex-serviceman and traffic cop, posted at the Sector 40 traffic light, died after falling ill on duty. Doctors, who carried out his postmortem, said the cop suffered a heart attack and died on the way to the hospital.""It is a difficult job. But we have to go on,"" said a sub-inspector, who has been deployed for traffic management during rain in the Iffco Chowk area. Donning a Khaki uniform as opposed to the signature white and blue for regular traffic cops, he said, ""I was sent here from Police Lines. Some traffic cops have breathing masks but I haven't procured one yet."" The SI had had persistent throat pain for a few days. Breathing masks, according to doctors, are essential for traffic cops who have prolonged exposure to dust and smoke. ""Prolonged exposure to pollution can cause long-term conditions such as diabetes. It can also cause blocking of blood vessels, triggering cardiac arrests,"" said Dr Amit Bhushan, an interventional cardiologist at Paras Hospital.However, traffic cops are reluctant to wear masks. ""I can't breathe in a mask. I am from a village and was used to fresh air,"" said a traffic cop. On being asked for a solution, Dr Bhushan said newer models of N-95 masks, which monitored pollution levels, could be fitted to the belt of cops and charged to give inter-nasal oxygen.Another traffic cop, posted at the Sirhaul toll, said he had been experiencing back aches for the past two years and it had got worse as he had to stand the whole day. Several cops said that managing the sea of traffic at the Sirhaul toll made it one of the most challenging postings.Doctors said that prolonged standing could cause a condition called deep vain thrombosis in the legs. ""It can lead to clots which can travel to the lungs and cause pulmonary embolism,"" said Dr Bhushan.According to ACP (traffic) Hira Singh, all traffic cops can get healthcare benefits from the government and treatment at empanelled hospitals. ""Health check-up camps are also carried out frequently,"" he said.Sources said the addition of 150 cops to the traffic police force could reduce the workload but experts said there was an urgent need to make a roster and ensure that duties don't exceed beyond certain time.Besides, traffic cops have to constantly engage with commuters. One traffic cop said, ""If there is rain and there is a traffic jam, we get blamed for it."" Another said, ""People give excuses to avoid getting a challan. We have to argue constantly.""""A traffic cop has to do much more than manage traffic. There is a need for a roster so that traffic cops can plan their day. They should work for say, six hours, and have the rest of day to look after family, take rest etc,"" said Dr Bhram Deep Sandhu, a senior psychiatrist at Gurugram's Civil hospital.Traffic cops will work in shifts: DCPTraffic cops will work in shifts across the city, according to a decision taken in a meeting led by DCP (traffic) Sulochana Gajaraj on Saturday. This comes at the backdrop of traffic cop Bansi Lal falling sick on duty and dying of a heart attack on Thursday.Police PRO Subhash Bhokan, said the meeting was organised under instructions of police chief KK Rao. ""Traffic cops will work in shifts to make traffic duties more effective,"" said a police spokesperson. ""Traffic rosters have been prepared so that traffic cops can get enough rest every day as well as at the end of a week,"" said a senior traffic cop.There was also a discussion on traffic management during rain. Rain duties for the season have been allotted and extra police personnel posted at traffic junctions. TNN/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Illegal sand mining causing air pollution in Gaya, say experts","GAYA: Stakeholders and domain experts deliberated on the issue of rising level of air pollution in Gaya at a workshop organised in Bodh Gaya by the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED), a Delhi-based NGO.Incidentally, Gaya was listed as the fourth most polluted city in the world as per recent WHO report.Participating in the discussion, Rai Madan Kishore, retd special secretary in state government said instead of clamouring for new laws, focus should be on strict implementation of existing laws to curb pollution.""The greatest contributor to air pollution in Gaya are suspended dust particles released by unregulated building construction activities and sand mining. Use of coal by local dhabas and smoke-emitting diesel- driven three wheelers also make major contribution to city's air pollution,"" Kishore said.CEED Programme officer Ankita Jyoti, quoted study reports suggesting spurt in chest diseases and pollution related deaths. ""Till about 30 years back, 90% of cancer patients were smokers. /The percentage of smokers among cancer patients has now come down to about 50% and non- smokers inhaling highly polluted air develop cancer,"" said the study.Munger University VC Ranjit Verma, while questioning the credibility of recent WHO report, demanded installation of more pollution monitoring units in Gaya for proper assessment of air quality. ""The present monitoring station was installed at a point, which apparently was the most polluted part of the city and generalisation about the whole town should not be made on the basis of single point data,"" said Verma.Conceding that air pollution offered a real threat for Gayaites, Prof Verma who taught chemistry to PG students in Magadh University before being appointed as Munger University VC said that non-medical use of plaster of paris should be discouraged. ""As on date plaster of paris was indiscriminately used for wall smoothing and other decorative purposes,"" said Verma.Central Bihar Chamber of Commerce president Kaushalendra Pratap said water retention in Falgu river bed was a must to prevent upward movement of Falgu sand dust that significantly added to Gaya's air pollution. ""The business body has already presented a nine point charter of demands to control air pollution,"" said Kaushalendra. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Andhra Pradesh: Two dialysis centres to come up in Palnadu region,"GUNTUR: In what could be a big relief for the kidney patients from backward Palnadu region in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, the state government has granted dialysis centres for Narasaraopet and Macherla towns. The new dialysis centres will be set up in the local government hospitals. While Narasaraopet centre will have eight-bed capacity, Macherla centre will serve seven patients at a time. /At present, two dialysis centres - one each at Government General Hospital (GGH), Guntur city and district government hospital at Tenali - are in operation. The victims of kidney ailments from Palnadu region are compelled to visit Guntur city by travelling at least 150-200 km for treatment as there is no dialysis centre in the vicinity. In fact, getting treatment in Guntur centre too is not that easy as the bed strength is very limited. ""Patients should either wait for their turn at GGH or spend monies to get treatment from the private hospitals. Since, many of the people coming all the way from Macherla, Vinukonda areas are poor, they are forced to wait for their turn at GGH,"" said a senior medical officer at GGH. The launch of new dialysis centres in Narasaraopet and Macherla would be of great help for the poor and also reduce the work load on GGH centre. Sources said that majority of the patients who are undergoing treatment for kidney ailments are from Palnadu region. ""There could be multiple reasons for more number of people from Palnadu region suffering from kidney ailments. Dependence on high fluoride content ground water, high consumption of pesticides in the agriculture fields in addition to the country-made liquor could be the reasons,"" observed senior nephrologist Dr Chinta Ramakrishna. He noted that at least three out of the four patients undergoing treatment in Guntur hospitals are from Palnadu region. About 58 patients were undergoing dialysis in GGH per day. The dialysis centre in GGH had handled about 1659 sessions of dialysis in the last one month. This means that the Centre is treating not less than 50 patients a day from which at least 25-30 are from Palnadu region. Dialysis centres in Narasaraopet and Macherla to be operationalized shortly. Narasaraopet centre to have eight beds and Macherla centre seven beds. With at least 60-70 percent existing patients at GGH, Guntur are from Palnadu region, the new centre would help patients cut down their travel time and also costs. People from Palnadu region are prone to kidney ailments. Experts believe that dependence of high volume fluoride water, usage of high content of pesticides in the agriculture fields could be the reason for kidney diseases. Air-pollution being caused by cement factories and lime kiln units too could be the reason. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"14,800 people died prematurely in Delhi due to fine particulate matter, says new study","Exposure to fine particular matter or PM 2.5 resulted in the premature deaths of 14,800 people in Delhi in 2016, according to a new study on pollution-related mortality in 13 Asian megacities in India, China, Pakistan and Bangladesh.The study, conducted by researchers from Thailand, Singapore and India's IIT Bombay, and revealed that Beijing and Shanghai had the highest number of premature deaths in the world in 2016, numbering 18,200 and 17,600 respectively. Delhi ranked third, and was followed by Mumbai, which had 10,500 premature deaths related to air pollution.The other Indian cities featured in the study included Kolkata with 7,300 deaths, and Bengaluru and Chennai both of which had 4,800 premature deaths. The total mortality in Dhaka and Karachi was 9,100 and 7,700 respectively.Earlier in 2018, 14 Indian cities, including Delhi, Varanasi, Kanpur, Patna, Agra, Jaipur, Muzaffarpur and Jodhpur, had figured in a list of the 20 most polluted cities in the world by the World Health Organisation,The study also calls for more stringent policies, and highlights the ""need for urgency in setting up decisive air quality targets"" by authorities and joint regional efforts to control air pollution. /""Though China has taken initial steps with pollution control targets and strategy, there is an urgent need for government policy in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan,"" it added. The results aren't surprising. PM 2.5, a category of pollutants that are less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter, can penetrate deep into the lungs, and has been linked to cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases, cancer, and most recently, type 2 diabetes. In a 2017 study published in the medical journal The Lancet, 1.81 premature deaths in India were linked to air pollution, surpassing China (1.58 million) as the highest in the world. In 2016, a study by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology revealed that on an average, Indians lost 3.4 years of their life due to air pollution. Delhi was the worst hit among all the states, with air pollution shortening the life expectancy of its residents by 6.3 years, followed by West Bengal (6.1 years) and Bihar (5.7 years).

"In revival mode, harmonica hits the high notes, offers pulmonary relief too","While most musical instruments require time and effort to learn, the rudimentary harmonica (mouth organ) is an easy pick-me-up plaything that relies moderately on lung power. Bits of the harmonica sound were a common feature in Bollywood songs of old - remember Dev Anand in 'Hai apna dil to awara' (Solva Saal) and Dharmendra in 'Yeh dosti...' (Sholay). Then the disco era dawned, electronic sound followed and the harmonica was forgotten.City-based Nandu Belvalkar, who picked up the harmonica when barely 8, felt that the instrument deserved revival. In 2007, he started India's first harmonica club in Pune and the response was heartening. Today, most major cities across the country and even places in Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan have styled harmonica clubs on the Pune chapter.Belvalkar, now 73, strives to not just make the harmonica popular but trains one to play in a structured manner. /People played instinctively in the days of old, minus the grammar or organised training, he points out.With time on his hands after retirement, Belvalkar began conducting harmonica programmes in city auditoriums from 2000. In February this year, he organised Mumbai's first-ever full-fledged harmonica show which drew an audience of 300. And, on Narak Chaturdashi each year, his group plays at the city's old age home, Niwara.The fare on offer during these programmes is purely Bollywood songs. No blues, folk or jazz sounds here, which artistes like Bob Dylan and Stevie Wonder produced on their harmonicas. ""Blues and the like are popular abroad, not here. Personally, I find blues to be unrecognisable music. You hear blues and recollect nothing about it an hour later,"" he says wryly.Affinities for musical genres aside, the harmonica provides a medical remedy too. One of Belvalkar's students, Mandar Gadre (52), had developed a black patch on his lung after inhaling cement dust while working at a construction site seven years ago. The civil engineer, who cycles around 25km every morning, found his pedal power grudgingly taking him up to only 4km.Belvalkar had the solution: a pulmonary harmonica or pulmonica, which has frequencies that are different from the regular instrument. Gadre has been playing the pulmonica for the past six months, for 10 minutes first thing in the morning, and is back on track with his morning workout.Belvalkar explains that the pulmonica is a medically-authenticated instrument in the West for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cases. Devised by a Canadian doctor, notes played on it induce vibrations that increase the elasticity of the diaphragm, break the viscosity of fluids in the chest and help clear them. The instrument does not have a scale as such; it has chords. The pulmonicas used for chronic COPD cases have a partition in between the holes to allow for higher- and lower-pitched notes. The harmonica is all about judgment and feel, says Deepak Vaidya (63), who teaches the instrument as well as keyboards at Dhayari. He says it is easier to learn the keyboards as one can see the keys, unlike the harmonica. He has a collection of 12 harmonicas, the costliest being a Sydel-make at Rs 25,000. Sydel, along with Hohner and Suzuki, are the top three harmonica makers in the world, while cheaper Chinese versions are available a dime a dozen. Vaidya says there are basically two types of harmonicas - diatonic and chromatic. The chromatic instrument has a slider to offer more notes - a 12-hole harmonica will give you 48 notes using the slider. The chromatic harmonica, which doesn't have a slider, is best for Bollywood songs, he says.Madan Kumar Sharma (76), who came to Pune as a four-year-old during Partition, has been playing the harmonica for as long as he can remember. In his vast collection of harmonicas, his favourite one is the top-of-the-line Hohner silver concerto chromatic which he bought in Spain in 1974. This particular instrument costs around Rs 5 lakh today.In his early days, Sharma worked as a building supervisor but, on the side, would provide sound systems to orchestras and even drama shows like the popular 'Teen Paishacha Tamasha'. He cut the first extended play (EP) record of his harmonica renditions in 1968 before going on to cut one super long playing (LP) record, 9 CDs and 8 audio-cassettes. His harmonica recordings have been played on All India Radio and Radio Ceylon (now Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation).The blow-draw concept of the harmonica is stimulant for the lungs, says Belvalkar. He believes the pulmonica will catch momentum quickly because of the prevailing air pollution. ""Pollution causes the lungs and diaphragm to lose elasticity. Haemoglobin formation reduces and immunity, oxygen and energy levels in the body drop. Playing the harmonica is like doing pranayam. It is the only instrument in the world which plays both ways - breathing in and out. Baba Ramdev gives you kapalbhati while the harmonica gives you musical kapalbhati,"" he says.
