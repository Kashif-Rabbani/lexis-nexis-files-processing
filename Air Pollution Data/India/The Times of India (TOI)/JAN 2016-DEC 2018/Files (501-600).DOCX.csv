Delhi kids have lower lung capacity than those in US,"New Delhi: Children in Delhi have a far lower lung capacity and lung growth rate than kids of the same age in the US, according to a recent study by the department of pulmonary medicine at the Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute. While much of this could be attributed to genetics and nutrition, environmental factors like air pollution were also to blame, doctors who conducted the study said.To develop more suitable guidelines for north Indian children, doctors from the Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute and the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University College of Medical Sciences, conducted lung capacity tests on 670 healthy children (boys and girls) in the age group of 6 to 17 years of north Indian parentage and from a Delhi school selected randomly. The study found that, on average, the lung capacity of children in Delhi was 10% lower than those in the US or those of Caucasian origin. The rate of increase or the growth of lungs was also slow for children in Delhi compared to their US counterparts. /Until now, the results of pulmonary, or lung function, tests for children in India were compared with the American Thoracic Society-European Respiratory Centre spirometry guidelines. But according to the authors of the study, a correct interpretation of spirometry results - the most common test for management of lung diseases - comes from comparing the results of Indian children with the guidelines developed for healthy Indian children. Though several such guidelines have been developed for children in different regions of India, ""most of these are now outdated and have limited utility due to technological advances in equipment and revisions in methodology"", the study stated. The study advised pulmonologists and paediatricians to use comparative equations developed in India for correct interpretation of spirometry results. ""Use of equations developed in other populations is not advisable for interpreting data of Indians, as it is likely to lead to substantial errors and, thus, adversely affect management decisions. This occurs because the Caucasian and Indian predictions of normal values differ substantially,"" the study stated.Dr S K Chhabra, who led the study, told TOI: ""We developed our own model to understand lung function among children here. What we found is that by the time they reach 18 years of age, the lung capacity of both boys and girls is about 10% lower than American children. The lungs were also found to be growing at a slower rate; so, the maximum size they were reaching was smaller. A part of this could be attributed to ethnic differences, genetics, frequency of childhood infections and nutrition, but another reason could be environmental factors like pollution. There are many other studies, especially those conducted on Chinese children, which link retarded growth and lower lung capacity to air pollution.""For example, a similar study published in 2010 in the journal of respiratory medicine in Science Direct found that children living in the most polluted district had significantly slower growth rates in lung functions than those from the least-polluted district. Dr Chhabra added that the question on chronic effects of air pollution could be answered in two ways: ""The first is to follow a group of children in two different environments over several years and compare their growth. Such studies have been carried out in several countries and suggest that children growing in polluted air suffer from reduced lung growth. To date, this has never been done in India,"" he said. ""Another way is to compare growth patterns in the population. The US models for lung growth in children have been developed using the national survey, NHANES III. My models, too, predict lung function in north Indian children. A comparison of growth patterns of Indian and US Caucasian children of same heights shows interesting differences. Both have nearly the same size till the age of about 8 years when the lungs complete their normal physical growth. However, subsequent growth in size shows a progressively increasing difference between the two countries with Indian boys and girls having lungs that are about 10% smaller when they become adults.The environment ministry had recently stated that there was no conclusive evidence to establish a direct correlation of death exclusively with air pollution and that international studies should not be cited as reference to the impact of air pollution in India. Experts said it was high time the government paid attention to local health studies that established the dangerous impacts of air pollution. ""These stark evidences prove that we have already compromised health of our future generation. Stop denial and the blame game. Speed up action on all pollution sources to meet clean air standards within a time frame,"" said Anumita RoyChowdhury, head of Centre for Science and Environment's clean air programme./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

'Human activity' again leads to fire at Bhandewadi dump yard,"NAGPUR: The dump yard at Bhandewadi once again caught fire on Sunday. Like previous times, the fire is said to have been caused due to human activity. ""The ragpickers smoke bidi and often leave it here. As the weather is windy, it took no time for the fire to spread,"" said a worker at the site, adding that the fire spread in around half a kilometre area.A fire tender has been permanently deployed at Bhandewadi and by Monday, the fire was reportedly doused. ""We have controlled it but smoke still remains,"" said officials of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) fire and emergency services department.Some days back, TOI had mentioned that NMC needs to take scientific measures to get rid of the waste lying at Bhandewadi dumping yard which is repeatedly on flames since last year. In summer, 200 windrows (heaps of solid waste) spread over an area of 6-7 acres had caught fire, leading to extensive air pollution and health problems for nearby residents.Though NMC had then claimed that entry of ragpickers would be banned, sources at the spot said that situation has not changed./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Study finds chulhas to be the key cause for COPD,"Aurangabad: Doctors at the department of pulmonary medicine, MGM Medical College have found biomass smoke as the key cause of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease (COPD) among non-smokers.The study is significant as environmentalists and air quality experts have long found lack of a city-specific study a major hurdle in implementation of an action plan for air quality.The research aimed at exploring the different causes of non-smoking COPD patients seeking treatment at the department. It also wanted to compare the demographic incidence of COPD in non-smokers.This included testing and evaluation of 126 in-patient and out-patient department's patients above the age of 30 years between August 2012 and October 2014. The subjects of the study underwent spirometry and were diagnosed with COPD.The study was conducted by Shivaprasad Kasat, Hafiz Deshmukh, Nisha Mathew, Zone Xavier, Ashish Deshmukh and Sunil Jadhav. The study kept patients who smoke out of its purview to isolate other risk factors.The study states, 'In the past decade and especially the past five years, results from a growing number of published studies have suggested that risk factors other than smoking are strongly associated with COPD.'According to the detailed medical history of the patients studied, it has emerged that exposure to biomass smoke comprises a major part of the cause of COPD.Environmental tobacco smoke exposure has been found to be the second most prevalent cause of COPD in the study. /Occupational exposure, outdoor and indoor air pollution, long standing bronchial asthma, history of pulmonary tuberculosis and associated co-morbidities are outlined as other causes that lead to instances of COPD.Ninety-seven of the 126 patients studied, that is, 76.98% patients had been exposed to traditional chulha.International air quality expert Geetanjali Kaushik says that the key sources of biomass smoke are burning of cow dung and wood for fuel.She added, ""This smoke has detrimental results on health as the burning of biomass takes place in an enclosed environment and the smoke doesn't have any space to disperse.""As women, children and elderly people stay indoors most of the time they have a prolonged exposure to the emission.Kaushik added that biomass smoke is high in particulate matter, CO2, CO, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Avoid burning tyres in open',"PATNA: With a view to controlling air pollution, the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) has appealed to Patnaites not to burn tyres, biomass, dried leaves and solid waste in the open. It has also advised people to avoid using coal and cow dung in braziers and start using e-rickshaws and cycles.""Burning organic matter like leaves produces a thick white smoke with a high amount of suspended particulate matter (SPM) which is very harmful for lungs. Tyres, on the other hand, release dark, thick smoke that contains cyanide, carbon?/monoxide, sulfur?dioxide and products of butadiene and styrene,"" BSPCB official Navin Kumar said on Saturday.According to Patna Medical College and Hospital's (PMCH) TB and chest department head Dr Ashok Shankar Singh, ""Continued exposure to polluted air can lead to chronic bronchitis, emphysema as well as breathing problems. Some may even develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - a group of lung diseases that block airflow and make it difficult to breathe.""With the beginning of the winter season, the TB and chest department of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) gets nearly 30 to 40 cases every day against 20 to 25 cases in other months of the year. Dr Manish Shankar of IGIMS said, ""High levels of air pollution in the winter season cause asthma as well as viral and respiratory infections. Due to prolonged exposure, these infections usually reach the advanced stage and patients have to undergo lung treatment.""BSPCB public relations officer Birendra Kumar told TOI that awareness camps and street plays will soon be organized in villages and towns to make people aware about the ill-effects of air pollution and how to prevent them./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Punjab, Haryana refuse to take blame as smog envelopes Delhi again","Patiala: With the Delhi government again pointing fingers at Punjab and Haryana for the smog that has returned to the national capital, Punjab on Monday refused to take the blame, citing zero stubble burning cases with wheat fields replacing paddy across the state.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had on Monday came down heavily on the Delhi government for not filing a comprehensive action plan on ways to deal with severe air pollution in the city. The tribunal had also slammed the authorities for holding the India-Sri Lanka cricket Test despite bad air quality when smog returned after showing some signs of improvement over the last few days. The Delhi government, on the other hand, tried to pass the buck to Punjab and Haryana, saying there was too much crop stubble burning happening there.However, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials maintain that not a single straw of paddy was been burnt in the state over the last 15 days. They also point out that over 85% of the paddy fields in the state have now been replaced with wheat crop.PPCB chairman Kahan Singh Pannu said there was no alarming situation in the state and the fields were lush green with wheat sprouting from the ground. /He said the ambient air quality index (AQI) had also improved over the last few days with the monitoring stations in Amritsar, Ludhiana and Mandi Gobindgarh showing readings of 240, 283 and 286 micrograms per cubic metre respectively, as on Monday.Till a few days back, when paddy residue was being put on fire across the state, the AQI monitors were reflecting readings of 320 micrograms per cubic metre in Amritsar, 332 micrograms per cubic metre in Ludhiana and 371 micrograms per cubic metre at Mandi Gobindgarh.Pannu said there has been a considerable fall in the pollution levels across the state, suggesting that stubble burning contributed around 100 micrograms per cubic metre pollutants to the air. However, as the state's air quality is still in the bracket of 'poor', the PPCB chairman attributed the situation to the phenomena of 'winter inversion', in which suspended particulate matter gets concentrated in the lower strata of the atmosphere.The dispersion of pollutants was at an all-time low and thus the state's air quality was yet to improve further as factors like industrial and vehicular pollution continue to add pollutants to the atmosphere, PPCB chairman said. ""However, blaming Punjab for smog in Delhi now was totally out of context,"" he added. Meanwhile, on Monday, the AQI readings for 16 monitoring stations installed in Delhi showed an average reading of 468.7 micrograms per cubic metre. These stations reflected that the air quality across the national capital was in the 'serve' category, forcing the Delhi government to dig out the reasons for increased pollution in the air.Punjab registers 46.01% fall in number of straw burning casesDuring the recently concluded paddy harvest season, the state this year registered a 46.01% fall in the number of cases of straw burning. According to the data available with Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), while a total of 80,879 cases of stubble burning had been reported from across the state in 2016, the number was 43,660 till November 18, 2016, after which no data was collected as straw burning had come to an end. The cases recorded last year were based on the information gathered by PPCB through various field officers and complaints received at its offices. This year, the board had used satellite imagery and data collected from the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre in Ludhiana.Chandigarh: Haryana reported just 319 incidents of paddy stubble burning during the last seven days. According to Haryana, since there has been no case of straw burning in the state since November 30, Delhi has no reason to blame it for the haze enveloping it. On Monday, Haryana asked the Delhi government to introspect and set own its house in order to check the source of smog in the capital. According to information, 319 cases were reported from various districts of Haryana between November 25 and 27. There has been no fresh incident since then, according to a report released by the Haryana environment department.Haryana environment minister Vipul Goel said soon after the meeting with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal last month, the state had been quick in its response. ""The reports of incidents of stubble burning over the past week are self-explanatory. We can provide the satellite imaging as well to support our stand. Since wheat sowing is in full swing and farmers have already carried out the first round of irrigation, hence there is no scope of stubble burning,"" said Goel.The minister said, ""For us, New Delhi is as important as Haryana. We are ready to share responsibilities with the national capital when it comes to fighting out the pollution is concerned. However, Haryana is not to be blamed as we have no incidents for past three days.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air pollution can damage a child's brain forever, says Unicef","The link between air pollution and respiratory diseases is well-established, but the United Nations Children's Fund, in a report on Tuesday, said there is a growing body of scientific research which shows that air pollution can permanently damage a child's brain.The findings come at a time when India, particularly in the north, is facing a serious crisis due to rising levels of pollution. Last month, Delhi schools had to be shut temporarily to reduce children's exposure to pollutants that had enveloped the capital.The Unicef report also said that South Asia had the largest proportion of babies living in areas where air pollution is at least six times higher than international limits (10 micrograms per cubic metre).The Unicef report, titled ""Danger in the air"", explains that brain damage can happen through several mechanisms. First, it stated, particulate matters can cause neuro-inflammation by damaging the blood-brain barrier - a thin, delicate membrane that protects the brain from toxic substances.Second, exposure to specific air pollutant particles, such as magnetite, can lead to oxidative stress which is often the cause of neurodegenerative diseases. /Quoting multiple studies, the UN body said polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons commonly found in areas of high automobile traffic contribute to a loss of or damage to white matter in the brain. White matter is important for continued learning and development. ""Pollutants can permanently damage their developing brains,"" Unicef executive director Anthony Lake said.The latest analysis of multiple researches states that pollutants can cross the placenta and affect the developing brain of a foetus.

Pollution can permanently damage a child's brain: Unicef,"NEW DELHI: The link between air pollution and respiratory diseases is well-established, but the United Nations Children's Fund, in a report on Tuesday, said there is a growing body of scientific research which shows that air pollution can permanently damage a child's brain. The findings come at a time when India, particularly in the north, is facing a serious crisis due to rising levels of pollution. Last month, schools in Delhi had to be shut temporarily to reduce children's exposure to pollutants that had enveloped that national capital.The Unicef report also said that South Asia has the largest proportion of babies living in areas where air pollution is at least six times higher than international limits (10 micrograms per cubic metre).The UN body said globally 17 million babies under the age of one live in such highly polluted areas, of which an estimated 12.2 million live in South Asia, which is the highest. /East Asia and the Pacific have 4.3 million babies breathing toxic air.The Unicef report, titled ""Danger in the air"", explains that brain damage can happen through several mechanisms. First, it stated, particulate matters can cause neuro-inflammation by damaging the blood-brain barrier - a thin, delicate membrane that protects the brain from toxic substances.Second, exposure to specific air pollutant particles, such as magnetite, can lead to oxidative stress which is often the cause of neurodegenerative diseases. Quoting multiple studies, the UN body said polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons commonly found in areas of high automobile traffic contribute to a loss of or damage to white matter in the brain. White matter contains nerve fibres that are critical in helping neurons communicate across different parts of the brain. It is important for continued learning and development.""Not only do pollutants harm babies' developing lungs, they can permanently damage their developing brains and, thus, their futures,"" Unicef executive director Anthony Lake said.Exposure to pollutants inhaled during pregnancy is also harmful. The latest analysis of multiple researches states that pollutants can cross the placenta and affect the developing brain of a foetus. Research also shows an association between prenatal exposures to high levels of air pollution and development delay at age three, as well as psychological and behavioural problems later in childhood, including symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depression. ""One study reports a four-point drop in IQ by the age of five among a sample of children exposed in utero to toxic air pollution,"" the report said.""A young child's brain is especially vulnerable because it can be damaged by a smaller dose of toxic chemicals compared to an adult's brain. Children are also highly vulnerable to air pollution because they breathe more rapidly and also because their physical defences and immunities are not fully developed', Unicef said.It advised parents to reduce children's exposure to pollutants by making it feasible for them to travel during times of the day when air pollution is lower; provide appropriately fitting air filtration masks in extreme cases.""Improve children's overall health to improve their resilience.

Visual pollution is an ugly blind spot in Pune's Smart City plans,"By- Mangesh KashyapRecently, Delhi and the NCR region have been in the news for extraordinarily high readings of air pollution.But what are we doing to avoid a similar situation in Pune? It is being developed as a Smart City, but at what cost?Apart from the obvious land, air and water pollution, there are certain other types of pollution that affect the quality of life in a city. /Visual pollution is one such type.Visual pollution - that includes irregular formations, illegal waste dumps, billboards, unsightly cables, dilapidated buildings, mounds of construction debris, ugly graffiti etc. - severely affects a person's ability to enjoy a view. This kind of pollution affects overall quality of life, reduces aesthetic appeal, economic health and civic-sense.In Pune, even the suburban areas are mismanaged and it is impossible to enjoy nature anymore. Visual pollution not just offends the eyes, it also has an impact on the economic health of a city. Ugly sights also trigger irritability. Children who grow up in such areas never learn to value pleasant environments. So, visual pollution has a very distinct characterchanging effect.An interesting study by a student compared the quality of life of people living in a visually pleasant area to those living in unpleasant ones. The study looked into people's psyche and the reaction to the visual quality of the immediate environment. Social civility and people's behaviour around solid waste were observed. It was observed that visual pollutants are omnipresent. Residential areas, schools, hospitals, places of worship... no place is free of visual pollution. This kind of pollution was found to create deep displeasure and decline in the civic sense. It was also found to adversely affect the psychological health.Moreover, many kinds of visual pollutants are also linked to diseases such as asthma and chikungunya. The visual environment is as indispensable as clean water and fresh air.

Air quality 'Very Poor'. Why citizens should be worried,"The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that the city's air quality has been progressively worsening since THE last couple of days, with particulate matter (PM) 2.5 being the prominent pollutant. PM 2.5 is an atmospheric particulate matter of diameter of fewer than 2.5 micrometers and can reportedly lead to premature death from heart and lung disease. Every night after 8, the PM2.5 levels are reaching danger levels and at times going as bad as some areas of Delhi, which are being monitored by the same agency. A similar trend was recorded last year too. /Against the permissible limit of 60 microgram per cubic metre (mpcm), PM2.5 has been recorded over 300 mpcm and entered the 'very poor' zone during last and this year's winters. On Thursday night, TOI accompanied NGO Green Vigil Foundation to identify the sources of pollutant in and around Civil Lines, where the monitoring equipment is placed. Though it is difficult to pinpoint the cause accurately without a scientific study, TOI analyses the probable sources of air pollution after speaking to expertsTEMPERATURE INVERSIONDue to drop in temperature during winters, the mixing of pollutants in atmosphere reduces. Rakesh Kumar, director of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri), says, "" Rise in particulate matter takes place during winters when normal atmospheric conditions become inverted. Since wind speed is low during this period, dispersion of pollutants does not take place and they remain limited to a region."" Especially in the night hours, the air gets trapped. Says environment activist Kavita Rattan, ""Pollutants remain present in the ambient air in high concentration and this is the reason why smog occurs."" Though there has also been an increase in the concentration of PM 10, it was recorded for a short duration. Close to Wednesday midnight, the PM 10 levels went as high as 433 but came down to 257 after midnight and 148 by 4am. The size of PM 10 is 10 micrometers or less in diameter while PM2.5 is of diameter less 2.5 micrometers or less. ""As PM 10 particles are heavier, they tend to settle down quickly. PM 2.5 being lighter, they remain present in the ambient air and are the most dangerous for human health,"" says Rattan.BONFIRES Burning of wood and other waste is a common sight across the city in winters. On Thursday night, TOI and Green Vigil came across more than a dozen cases of wood burning in a 2 kilometre radius from Civil Lines. From the terrace of a five-storeyed building in the area, heavy smog was clearly visible. Night watchmen posted at various places like Udyog Bhavan, Ravi Bhavan, divisional commissioner office and schools and bungalows were found burning not just wood but also leaf litter and solid waste. A group of men were seen burning plastic and solid waste too. At Kasturchand Park around midnight, many squatters were found burning chunks of wood and other waste. At many spots inside the park, ash residue was seen, indicating that burning was taking place regularly at the ground. At Residency Road in Sadar, some residents were burning big logs along with paper and plastic waste. ""Burning contributes significantly in the rise of PM2.5 matter. This can be one of the main reasons behind deterioration of city's air quality during winters,"" says Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of Green Vigil.In 2015, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court had taken suo motu cognisance of a TOI report on burning garbage in the open and had issued notices to the state government and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). Following this, the civic body had intensified its drive against waste burning. According to NMC officials, action is taken at zonal level in cases of burning waste. However, they have no information available regarding action taken against people burning wood and waste in night during winters. POWER PLANT POLLUTANTSAccording to experts, there is a possibility of pollutants emitted from Koradi Thermal Power Station (KTPS) being trapped near the monitoring equipment. ""It all depends on the wind direction. The plant's chimney is very tall so the pollutants disperse far away. But if the wind is flowing from Koradi towards Nagpur, it carries the pollutants in the city, especially particulate matter, which remains trapped in the air,"" says Mehul Kosurkar, core team member of Green Vigil. VEHICULAR, OTHERS SOURCESOn Wednesday night, a layer of smog and dust particle was spread over almost everywhere. A decline in air quality can also be because of multiple polluting sources. ""It is possible that the vehicular traffic is high near the monitoring station,"" says Kumar. Apart from this, construction work can also be a causative agent. ""The city is witnessing large-scale construction activities with metro, Sadar flyover, concretization of roads and individual constructions. The pollutants from all these sources get trapped in winters due to inversion,"" says Chatterjee. SHOULD I BE WORRIED?Though the data available with CPCB is based on the recordings of a single monitoring station based in Civil Lines, the situation is ""worrisome"" for the entire city. ""Civil Lines is one of the greenest areas of the city which does not witness very high vehicular movement. Imagine if the quality of air is very poor here, how bad it would be in other parts of the city,"" says Chatterjee.To get the full picture, comprehensive data from multiple locations is needed. ""More stations to monitor real-time air quality need to be set-up in different parts of the city,"" he adds.DATA DIFFERENT: MPCB The figures available with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) are quite different from the CPCB data for the same monitoring location. As per MPCB regional officer Rahul Wankhede, the highest value of PM 2.5 on December 6 was recorded 142.39 mpcm. On the other hand, the highest PM2.5 value, as per CPCB data for the same day, was 328 mpcm. The reason behind this variation is not clear.Wankhede too says that burning of wood and other materials during winters deteriorates the air quality.

"Haze stays, traps dust; air quality plunges","Mumbai: It was another day under a thick haze blanket for Mumbaikars. Weathermen said that the smoggy conditions could continue for the next two days. /Though air cleared up a bit on Sunday, ensuring better visibility, pollution levels rose. According to System for Air Quality Weather Forecasting and research (SAFAR), the air quality index (AQI) went from 237 on Saturday to 240. An AQI between 201 and 300 is considered poor and people sensitive to air pollution may experience uneasiness. Sunday's AQI was worst since Diwali.""The pollution levels worsened on Sunday as dust particles were trapped in the air. Winds continued to be calm. The conditions will improve slowly,"" said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The visibility, however, improved as fog and moisture levels lowered, he said. On Sunday, visibility was 1/10th of what it is on a clear day. In simple terms, visibility is the distance at which prominent objects can be identified with naked eye. Fog and moisture affect visibility. By evening, moisture levels at IMD's Santacruz as well as Colaba observatories lowered marginally.

"Toxic air raises risk of high BP, states study","HYDERABAD: Air pollution at busy road junctions and high traffic density roads in Hyderabad is taking a toll on the health of people who spend long hours outside their homes. A research conducted in the city reveals that shortterm and long-term exposure to particulate matter in the air at traffic-congested stretches is leading to hypertension, or high blood pressure, and other respiratory ailments. Worst-hit from longterm exposure are roadside vendors and bus commuters from short-term exposure.Doctors and paramedical staff of city-based NGO, Helping Hand Foundation (HHF), conducted tests on vendors and bus commuters at different locations in the city. /The screening started on November 7. Areas covered included Mehdipatnam road intersection and Ryotu bazar, Rethibowli, Attapur, Nanalnagar, Langarhouz, Golconda and Gudimalkapur. People in more areas are being surveyed for a comprehensive report on the ill-effects of air pollution on the cardiac health of residents.""Our study revealed that 35% people had mildly high blood pressure (140/90) and all of them have been on medication. About 15% of the people had high BP, but they were not aware. About 10% complained of respiratory diseases,"" said Helping Hand Foundation managing trustee Mujtaba Hasan Askari.He said the study focused on both long-term and shortterm impact of exposure to air pollution. Two categories of people who are exposed to pollution for long hours have been selected. While one group included push-cart vendors and hawkers, the second group consisted of bus commuters. As part of the study, commuters were screened for hypertension and respiratory ailments at bus stops.Askari said the data from the study will be used to counsel the targeted groups and ensure that they are on medication and reduce exposure to air pollutants.""A recently-published study by the American Heart Association's journal Hypertension revealed that both shortand long-term exposure to air pollutants, commonly associated with vehicle exhaust, airborne dust and dirt, may influence if someone develops high blood pressure by inhaling these pollutants. The results showed that hypertension was significantly associated with short-term exposures to sulphur dioxide and particulate matter.

HC raps govt on med waste disposal,"NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court on Friday directed the state government, the Center and various other bodies, including state and central pollution control boards, to file responses regarding disposal of medical waste in the open without following the prescribed procedure. The high court also issued notice to all the 13 district magistrates, chief medical officers and various other officials of the state health department in the matter. The HC order came following a PIL filed by Karan Kumar, a resident of Nainital town, on Friday alleging that medical waste generated in private and government hospitals in the state is being disposed of in the open, thereby posing a threat to public health. /Counsel for the petitioner B M Pingal said, “As a matter of fact, bio-medical waste is being thrown in municipal area — in open trenches, on roadsides, drains, water bodies etc in Haldwani city, in Nainital district. This is evident from news reports published in various newspapers. Such negligent action needs judicial intervention.” In his plea, the petitioner mentioned that the state government, while replying to an RTI query, had said that no management system complying with the ‘Bio-Medical Waste Management Rule, 2016’ is in place in government hospitals. Citing various districts of the state, including Pithorgarh and Champawat, the petition alleged that hospitals in these places are “disposing of and segregating Bio-Medical Waste by way of burning in open dumping areas, which poses a threat to public health and which causes soil and air pollution and even underground water resources.” The petitioner alleged that the state government is completely silent over the issue. The PIL also stated that no data in respect to disposal and segregation of bio-medical waste is available to find out the total quantity of such waste generated each day in different hospitals across the state, including veterinary hospitals and other private hospitals and clinics. Petitioner Karan Kumar also said in his petition: “One of the reasons behind non-disposal and non-treatment of such waste could be that the management of private hospitals or employees of government hospitals are in direct contact with people who collect the waste, such as needles, plastic glucose bottles, plastic nylon pipes, urinal bags, glass bottles of medicines, surgical gloves, mask, etc, for recycling and earn profit.” The petitioner also said such waste is also being thrown directly into various rivers such as the Ganga, Bhagirathi, Alaknanda, Sariu, Kali, Gori, Gola, Ramganga, Kosi and other tributaries, thereby spreading various diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, tetanus, dermal diseases, allergies among others.

HC raps govt on med waste disposal,"NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court on Friday directed the state government, the Center and various other bodies, including state and central pollution control boards, to file responses regarding disposal of medical waste in the open without following the prescribed procedure. The high court also issued notice to all the 13 district magistrates, chief medical officers and various other officials of the state health department in the matter. The HC order came following a PIL filed by Karan Kumar, a resident of Nainital town, on Friday alleging that medical waste generated in private and government hospitals in the state is being disposed of in the open, thereby posing a threat to public health. /Counsel for the petitioner B M Pingal said, “As a matter of fact, bio-medical waste is being thrown in municipal area — in open trenches, on roadsides, drains, water bodies etc in Haldwani city, in Nainital district.

Govt submits plan for combating air pollution under 3 categories,"New Delhi: The Delhi government on Monday submitted a detailed action plan to the National Green Tribunal on combating air pollution. It listed actions it proposed to take under three different categories of air quality. The move comes days after NGT rapped the government for not submitting its action plan as per its direction.The measures listed by the Delhi government would be implemented simultaneously with the Graded Response Action Plan. To ensure better coordination, LG Anil Baijal chaired a meeting of different departments.NGT, meanwhile, directed the Delhi government to consider shutting schools whenever air quality touched emergency levels to save children from inhaling pollutants. /A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar asked the AAP government to look into this aspect and incorporate it in its action plan. ""Why don't you close schools whenever the particulate matter levels are found to be beyond 900 microgram per cubic metres. Ask the schools to run on Saturday and Sunday, if required,"" the bench observed. The Delhi government counsel said this was difficult to implement because the children would suffer academically. He said air quality was bad in winter season for three months and if schools were closed during this period, it would be difficult to complete their syllabus and examinations would have to be postponed. The bench, however, expressed dissatisfaction and said, ""You don't do your duty and now you are giving reasons. You are spoiling the lives of children. Infants are taking antibiotics in Delhi. Why should they suffer?""In the last 12 years, the Delhi government has not taken a single step to bring down the ambient air quality within permissible limits. If the lungs of children are affected today, imagine the disease they will have after 20 years,"" it said while directing it to consider the suggestion.The action plan submitted before the tribunal is divided into three categories. The first category kicks in when PM2.5 and PM10 levels are above 300 and 500 \xB5g/m\xB3 with measures like mechanised sweeping and public awareness campaigns on pollution. Category II measures will come into effect when PM2.5 and PM10 cross 500 and 800 \xB5g/m\xB3 even as category I measures continue. Category II measures include wetting of fly-ash ponds, a ban on DG sets and water sprinkling along with mechanised sweeping of roads. Category III measures will kick in when PM2.5 and PM10 cross 600 and 1,000 \xB5g/m\xB3 and include measures, such as ban on entry of trucks into Delhi and putting a stop on civil engineering construction. These measures, however, start at the ""severe plus"" category of GRAP, which already mandates a ban on entry of trucks and stopping of construction activity along with the implementation of odd-even scheme when PM2.5 and PM10 levels stay over 300 and 500 \xB5g/m\xB3 for a period of 48 hours.The meeting held by LG saw a review of the action plan with directions issued to the corporations to ensure 100% management of municipal solid waste within 16 months. The LG also them to indicate the exact requirement of funds. He directed them to ensure that no landfill fires occurred, apart from instructing them to take help from experts at the science and technology ministry and IIT Delhi.As a pilot project, 14 home guard volunteers have been deployed as environment marshals in seven wards, the LG was informed, which will be increased to 100 in another 50 wards and will ensure that no waste burning or other environmental violations take place.The transport department said that 2,000 buses would be procured in 8-16 months.

'Brain lesions could trigger criminality',"JAIPUR: A recent study by the University of South California showed increased air pollution was causing inflammation in the brain of adolescents, increasing propensity to delinquency. Now, a new study shows brain lesions could trigger criminal acts.Lesions in the brain can affect the network responsible for morality and decision-making and spur criminal behaviour, researchers from the department of neurology at Vanderbilt University Medical Centre at Tennessee, US, found.This is the first time a mapping of brain lesions was undertaken for studying associated criminal behaviour, a phenomenon called sociopathy. The study was published last month in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. /A report appeared on website 'Science Daily'.Assistant professor of neurology Ryan Darby, who conducted the research during a fellowship at Harvard Medical School, said famous cases of acquired sociopathy include Phineas Gage, a railroad worker who in 1848 exhibited anti-social behavior after surviving an explosive blast that sent an iron rod through his brain, and Charles Whitman, the 'Texas Tower Sniper', who had a brain tumor and murdered 16 people in 1966.The researchers reviewed more recent cases of brain lesions associated with criminal behavior, examining MRI and CT scans of those individuals, Science Daily reported.""One group of 17 cases had a definitive correlation between criminal behavior and a brain lesion. A second group of 23 cases had an implied correlation when researchers didn't know whether the brain lesion occurred before or after the criminal behavior. In both groups, the lesions were at different areas of the brain,"" the website reported.Researchers used neuroimaging analyses -- large datasets compiled from healthy volunteers organized into a connectome, similar to a map of brain activity. ""While the lesions were in different brain areas, they were all connected to the same brain network,"" the website explained.Dr Darby said: ""We looked at networks involved in morality as well as different psychological processes that researchers have thought might be involved -- empathy, cognitive control and other processes that are important for decision making. We saw that it was really morality and value-based decision making -- reward and punishment decision making -- that the lesions were strongly connected to.""The website explained: ""Lesions in patients with criminal behaviour were more strongly connected to this moral decision-making network than lesions in patients without criminal behavior, suggesting that connectivity to this network was specific to criminal behavior.""The research was undertaken in collaboration with senior author Michael Fox, MD, PhD, assistant professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. Researchers explained that it was unclear why lesions in the brain sometimes caused hallucinations and delusions. ""In those diseases, it was also found that it was a common brain network connected to the same areas.

'Brain lesions could trigger criminality',"JAIPUR: A recent study by the University of South California showed increased air pollution was causing inflammation in the brain of adolescents, increasing propensity to delinquency. Now, a new study shows brain lesions could trigger criminal acts.Lesions in the brain can affect the network responsible for morality and decision-making and spur criminal behaviour, researchers from the department of neurology at Vanderbilt University Medical Centre at Tennessee, US, found.This is the first time a mapping of brain lesions was undertaken for studying associated criminal behaviour, a phenomenon called sociopathy. The study was published last month in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. /A report appeared on website 'Science Daily'.Assistant professor of neurology Ryan Darby, who conducted the research during a fellowship at Harvard Medical School, said famous cases of acquired sociopathy include Phineas Gage, a railroad worker who in 1848 exhibited anti-social behavior after surviving an explosive blast that sent an iron rod through his brain, and Charles Whitman, the 'Texas Tower Sniper', who had a brain tumor and murdered 16 people in 1966.The researchers reviewed more recent cases of brain lesions associated with criminal behavior, examining MRI and CT scans of those individuals, Science Daily reported.""One group of 17 cases had a definitive correlation between criminal behavior and a brain lesion. A second group of 23 cases had an implied correlation when researchers didn't know whether the brain lesion occurred before or after the criminal behavior. In both groups, the lesions were at different areas of the brain,"" the website reported.Researchers used neuroimaging analyses -- large datasets compiled from healthy volunteers organized into a connectome, similar to a map of brain activity. ""While the lesions were in different brain areas, they were all connected to the same brain network,"" the website explained.Dr Darby said: ""We looked at networks involved in morality as well as different psychological processes that researchers have thought might be involved -- empathy, cognitive control and other processes that are important for decision making. We saw that it was really morality and value-based decision making -- reward and punishment decision making -- that the lesions were strongly connected to.""The website explained: ""Lesions in patients with criminal behaviour were more strongly connected to this moral decision-making network than lesions in patients without criminal behavior, suggesting that connectivity to this network was specific to criminal behavior.""The research was undertaken in collaboration with senior author Michael Fox, MD, PhD, assistant professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. Researchers explained that it was unclear why lesions in the brain sometimes caused hallucinations and delusions. ""In those diseases, it was also found that it was a common brain network connected to the same areas. We were the first to apply this to looking at criminal behaviour,"" Dr Darby is quoted as saying by Science Daily website./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Fewer vehicles improve air quality,"PATNA: The statewide bandh called by RJD may have disrupted normal life, but it had a positive side too - improvement in air quality in the state capital on Thursday.Thanks to fewer vehicles on the streets, the level of PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns) was measured in the range of 80-160 micrograms per cubic metre from 11am to 4pm. While the permissible limit of PM 2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic metre, it is measured in the range of 240-300 micrograms per cubic meter on normal days in the state capital.""Though dust particles are considered to be the biggest contributor to PM 2.5, vehicular emission is also responsible for pollution. Patna is comparatively a smaller city faced with too much of traffic load leading to frequent snarls and higher vehicular emission. /Thus, fewer vehicles on the streets definitely lead to lower level of pollution,"" said a senior official in Bihar State Pollution Control Board, wishing anonymity.Health experts said particulate matter reach the lung, cause damage to the respiratory system and even lead to cancer. The common ailments caused by high level of air pollution include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, allergic reaction to the lungs, bronchitis, sinus blockage and asthma.Patna has lately emerged as one of the most polluted cities in the country, primarily with regard to air pollution caused by PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 10 micron). In fact, the air quality is at times worse than that of Delhi, which is infamous for air pollution. The situation worsens in the winter season. Patna's air quality index (AQI) as released by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) was measured at 404 on November 12, worse than Delhi's 308 on the same day. In May 2015, a WHO survey declared Patna as the second most polluted city in the country after Delhi.There are around 12 lakh vehicles in Patna at present, only a seventh of the number of vehicles in Delhi. But Patna's road space is much smaller, which pushes up vehicle density and, therefore, pollution. Besides, the number of diesel-run vehicles is quite high in Patna. Diesel pollutes more than petrol.Environmental experts have called for environment-friendly vehicular movement, including restriction on old vehicles and promotion of carpooling. ""Though dust particles and alluvial soil owing to the Ganga are the biggest contributors to higher level of particulate matter in Patna, steps should be taken to regulate vehicular traffic to reduce pollution level. Diesel vehicles more than 15 years old should not be allowed in the city. Besides, people can resort to carpooling and use public transport for reducing vehicular load on the streets in the city,"" said Ashok Ghosh, a Patna- based environmental scientist.

"Air pollution affects birth weight, study finds","CHENNAI: Air pollution may be harming babies even before they are born, adversely affecting their birth weight, Chennai-based researchers have found.The researchers have found that birth weight comes down by 4 grams when pregnant women are exposed to per 10 microgram /m3 change in particulate matter 2.5 (tiny particles that easily enter airways in the lungs). They calculated this after studying over 1,200 pregnant women in Chennai and two surrounding districts for five years from 2010.Researchers say the common source for air pollution in cities is vehicles. In the rural areas, a large part of pollution comes from solid fuel. They say the results are troubling because low birth weight may increase risks of various diseases including diabetes, heart disease and hypertension - some of the top three risk factors for death and disabilities.The Indian Council for Medical Research-funded study has been published in the electronic version of the scientific journal Environmental Research on Wednesday. ""This reduction in weight is just due to air pollution excluding all other risk factors. /For the first time, we have been able to establish a link between air pollution and maternal health. We have also been able to quantify the risk. It is also a clear indication that we will have to step up our pollution control measures,"" said one of the lead authors, Dr Kalpana Balakrishnan of Sri Ramachandra University.The researchers placed small pollution monitors in homes - one each in kitchens, living rooms and bedrooms -- of the all these women. More than 50% of the women spent over 18 hours in their homes. Some women, who worked, were asked to wear small monitors on for 24 hours. Researchers analysed the pollutants collected in the monitors' filter. After the babies were born, researchers got data about the condition of the babies and their birth weight from the primary health centres and government hospitals.While nearly 40% of population from rural areas - Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur - were using solid fuel in 2010, the number dropped to 10% by the end of the study, she said. ""Reduction in air pollution has the potential to improve birth weight. In the districts, for instance, if we are able to give pregnant women LPG for cooking, we will be able to bring down pollution levels from up to 200microgm/m3 to 30microgm/m3 and a corresponding increase in birth weight up to 70gms,"" said Dr Balakrishnan.The authors say cities like Chennai may not have such simple solutions for air pollution as they have complex sources, including vehicular pollution, burning of garbage and pollutants from construction sites. ""It is important to step up environmental pollution control efforts for overall health benefits. In Tamil Nadu, we give maternal and child health a top priority because once we do that over all benefits automatically improves,"" said director of public health Dr K Kolandaswamy.According to the Union health ministry data, at least 16.4% of the children have low birth weight -- their body weight is below 2.5kg. The researchers will replicate the study in highly polluted cities like New Delhi to further understand effects of pollution on pregnant women. They are also conducting a randomised control trial in around 800 women in Villupuram and Nagapattinam districts to see the effect of solid fuels used for cooking as part of a large scale multi-country effort. ""We will be providing about 400 women LPGs to see if there is stark difference in birth weight as per the conclusion we have arrived in this study. It will then be recommended as a national level policy to the health ministry,"" said Dr Balakrishnan. Read this story in Marathi/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Fireworks units want TN govt to implead in case,"Madurai: Fireworks manufacturers from across India converged at Sivakasi in Virudhunagar on Thursday and resolved that the Tamil Nadu government should implead in the case against them in the Supreme Court and that the industry should be provided exemption under Rule - 3B of Environmental (Protection) Rules of, 1986. They also wanted the case to be disposed of early. Manufacturers of fireworks from 20 states including Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh met following the uncertainty prevailing over the industry as the case seeking the ban on fireworks is pending before the apex court.Traders also participated in the meet and said that some people were trying to destroy the tradition and culture of the country in the name of environmental protection. For example, there was an effort to prevent use of coloured dyes during ""Holi"" festival in the name of ground water pollution. /The jallikattu ban, which was defeated due to protests by people was also an attack on culture and tradition.The fireworks manufacturers urged the people to express solidarity with them and protect the industry which helped them celebrate festivals like Diwali, Christmas and New Year and also other joyful moments. ""People should come together for the cause,"" said speakers.Later speaking to media persons, All India Federation of Fireworks Associations president A Asaithambi and vice-president K Mariappan said that the pollution in Delhi had not come down this season, though there was a ban on bursting fireworks during Diwali this year. The contributors to the air pollution in New Delhi, were vehicle emissions, smoke from burning harvested crops to clear agricultural lands and others such things and definitely not fireworks.The case seeking a ban on fireworks was filed in the court and it issued notices to all the states, which has caused the industry a lot of mental agony and stress, as they are unsure of what to do, they said. ""Now, the respective state governments should come forward to protect the industry and we have decided to meet the concerned ministers individually,"" they said. The Tamil Nadu government should implead in the case and the apex court should also dispose it at the earliest, they said.Advance payments, which met 90% of the working capital for the industry in Sivakasi, had stopped after the case was filed and manufactures had borrowed money from banks and continued the production. ""Now, if the case goes against our welfare, goods produced and a very high cost of producing that will go waste,"" they said. The industry had been shut for the third consecutive day, affecting the livelihood of eight lakh workers who were employed directly and indirectly by it./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Get winter toned,"It is winter time. You're forever cold, forever hungry and more often than not buried under layers of clothing. And then there is air pollution. Did anyone mention the word 'exercise'?/ It isn't such a scary proposition, after all. ""In my opinion, winter is the best time to shed excess fat as your body is burning more calories throughout the day and the weather gives you an advantage to work harder for longer durations without getting completely exhausted,"" says fitness expert Gagan Arora. Kill the SmogWe breathe approx 20,000 times in a day and working out takes it up to 30,000-50,000 times. While we can't spare our lungs completely from the pollution, we can surely keep a few things in mind to try and reduce the adverse effects. ""Try to breathe through your nose not mouth; wear a good mask/buff when going out for a walk/jog/cycle, especially in visible smoke; wear sunglasses to protect eyes,"" adds Arora. One should also have loads of fluids, antioxidant-rich foods and a bit of jaggery to beat the pollutants. According to fitness instructor Munmun Ganeriwal, ""You can combat bad air by doing yoga since it is all about adjusting to the changes in the environment through different types of asanas."" For instance, sun salutations help open up the chest, throat, and sinuses and warm up the body. It also helps in decongesting the respiratory organs - a common winter problem.Sweat Out IndoorsIf you don't want to go for an outdoor workout, join a health club or do some body weight strength training and yoga within the comfort of your living room. ""You can work on every muscle in your body with hundreds of exercises that can be performed in a small space and adapted to your fitness level. Go for body weight exercises like jumping jacks, burpees, tricep dips, bridges, planks et al,"" says Ganeriwal, adding that winter is a good time to enrich practice of Iyengar Yoga using a chair - the best part being that it can be implemented both at home and office. But make sure you are dressed right for your winter workout. Gearing up right is crucial in winters as bulky clothing can be a hindrance in bodily movements. ""If you really want to layer up, avoid woollens, go for play dry clothing instead as it keeps the sweat out and lets you work out well,"" says Arora. Healthy hogWe generally feel hungrier in winter as the body burns more calories through the day to keep itself warm. Nutrition plays an important role in any season and we need to change our meal plans as per our goals and season. ""In cold season, add more nuts, berries, soups and warm salads to your staple food,"" Arora mentions. Eat seasonal grains like bajra, makki, kuttu, seasonal fruits and veggies and winter treats made of til and gur.Five quick fixes for winter: Walk longer, run faster, cycle harder, lift heavier and stretch deeper For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Smoke-free furnaces to help potters of Dharavi slum breathe easy,"MUMBAI: Thanks to new smoke-free furnaces, residents of Mumbai's Dharavi slums will no longer have to deal with the menace of air pollution caused by the smoke-emitting furnaces, which are currently in use for making clay plots during festive seasons.An initiative launched by Mumbai's BJP secretary Divya Dhole's Sankalp Siddhi Trust will help the potters in Dharavi's Kumbharwada area to acquire smoke-free furnaces to make clay pots during festivals such as Diwali, Dussehra and Ganesh Chaturthi.The project, once complete, will help replace more than hundred traditional furnaces with the new non-polluting variety.The cost of each furnace is Rs 2.5 lakh.Considering the financial limitation of the potters, RCS Infotech Pvt Ltd has come forward to help the Trust raise the fund with the help of Corporate Social Responsibility fund.The project was initiated in 2014 after Dhole went to Gujarat to examine the smoke-free furnaces.Since then, four smoke-free furnaces are helping the potters of the area manufacture pots in a smoke-free environment.

"Residential biomass burning, open waste burning responsible for highest PM 2.5 exposure: Study","NEW DELHI: A new study released on Thursday titled ""Burden of Disease Attributable to Major Air Pollution Sources in India"" has found that residential biomass burning or use of solid fuels inside homes followed by coal combustion contributes to highest PM 2.5 exposure in both cities and villages. The study by IIT Bombay, US-based Health Effects Institute and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) also found that unlike many other countries where cities are worst affected, in India PM 2.5 exposure levels are similar in both rural and urban areas.The study which takes 2015 as the base year attributes nearly 25% of deaths linked with PM 2.5 exposure (26.7 lakh) in 2015 to biomass burning in homes. Surprisingly, these estimates do not even include indoor air pollution exposure from biomass burning. ""Residential biomass burning also impacts outdoor air quality, so the emissions exit the kitchen area and cause high exposures outside,"" said Chandra Venkataraman, a scientist from IIT Bombay who led a part of the research study. /Even in Delhi, which records one of the highest PM pollutions among Indian cities, the largest source of PM 2.5 is residential biomass burning followed by the open burning of trash and biomass according to the study. Coal combustion emissions from both industries and thermal power plants were responsible for 15.5% deaths attributable to PM 2.5 pollution nationally, about 6.1% were from agricultural burning even though the practice is limited to some northern and central Indian states. Venkataraman added that the deaths linked to PM 2.5 are going increase substantially if aggressive action is not taken to control emissions. According to the study's analysis of a 2050 scenario with no further air pollution control actions, the health burden would increase to over 73 million healthy years of life lost and over 3.6 million deaths in 2050. However, under an aggressive control scenario which includes a variety of action like complete LPG cover, shift from kerosene lighting to solar, 70% to 80% non-coal generation, field mulching to replace crop burning, private vehicle share drops to 40% and many others could avoid over 1.2 million annual deaths in 2050 if implemented.A recent Global Burden of Disease (GBD) report had found that PM 2.5 exposure is a risk factor for various diseases highest among which is ischemic heart disease (IHD) followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and stroke. It also estimated that exposure to outdoor air pollution is the third leading risk factor contributing to premature deaths among 79 behavioural, environmental and metabolic causes of mortality that were analysed. This study further builds on the GBD report to estimate source wise contribution to health impacts and PM 2.5 exposure. The inventories developed by the IIT Bombay team include emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), PM 2.5, black carbon and others from a multipollutant database for India between 1996-2015. IIT Bombay estimated emissions from each sector including industry, power, transport etc at the district level using government statistics and records like national sample survey (NSSO) and national family health survey (NFHS). The emissions were then projected to 2030 and 2050 under different energy and air pollution control scenarios. Further, PM 2.5 estimates from satellite data and ground monitoring data were used to estimate approximate population exposure by scientists from IHME. The national level contribution to mortality burden from transport was found to be only 2%. But authors caution that the geographic scale of the grid used for this analysis is large and unlikely to capture variation in traffic-related exposure. ""Transport and distributed diesel sources operate in closer proximity to populations..."" the study notes. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Chulhas linked to 25% of pollution-related deaths in India,"NEW DELHI: Exposure to air pollutant PM 2.5 from the burning of domestic biomass (chulha) is the deadliest source of air pollution in India, responsible for around 25% of all pollution-linked deaths in the country, according to a study.The study, 'Burden of Disease Attributable to Major Air Pollution Sources in India', found that the burning of biomass or solid fuel was the biggest source of PM 2.5 in both cities and villages. The situation could be worse as the study did not measure its indoor impact.""Residential biomass burning also impacts outdoor air quality, so the emissions exit the kitchen area and cause high exposure outside,"" said Chandra Venkataraman, a scientist at IIT-Bombay who led a part of the study.The research was conducted by IIT-Bombay and the US-based Health Effects Institute and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).The study attributed nearly 26.7 lakh deaths in India to the burning of biomass at home in 2015. Coal combustion was the second biggest source, causing 15.5% of all, or 16.6 lakh deaths. Agricultural burning - though the practice is limited to some northern and central states - caused 66,000 deaths.Even in Delhi, the largest source of PM 2.5 exposure is residential biomass burning, followed by open burning of trash, according to the study. /This may be due to the use of 'chulhas' and solid fuels in the rural areas surrounding Delhi.In fact, PM 2.5 pollution from the entire Indo-Gangetic plains area can travel to Delhi, scientists said. Venkataraman warned that this could be the tip of the iceberg, and said the deaths linked to PM 2.5 could increase substantially if proper action was not taken. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Sensors at metro stations to monitor CO2, help commuters breathe easy","CHENNAI: In an effort to provide a comfortable environment for the increasing number of patrons for metro trains, Chennai Metro Rail Limited has installed sensors at underground stations to monitor indoor air quality. Every station, a metro rail official said, will have sensors that will continuously monitor carbon dioxide levels while ventilation and air conditioning systems filter out particulate matter. /""The sensors are installed to ensure comfort of commuters though each may wait at an underground station for a maximum of only 10 minutes,"" he said. ""If the levels go up, the sensor will trigger an alarm.""CMRL follows norms prescribed by National Building Code and American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (Ashrae) to monitor air quality. Experts said CO2 levels depend on the number of commuters and frequency of trains.Officials said air-conditioning systems are installed with filters that throw out dirt, dust, pollen, smoke and other pollutants. The ventilation and air-conditioning system will keep stations cool, ensure air flow through the tunnels, draw out smoke during emergencies and remove heat generated.In 2016, an IIT Delhi study found high concentration of PM 2.5 on the premises of metro stations in that city, with some places recording levels more than 600 micrograms per cubic metre. The levels of PM 10 also was high. Permissible limits of PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels are 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre.However, S M Shiva Nagendra, associate professor from Environmental and Water resources engineering division, IIT Madras, said a good ventilation system can help tackle air pollution at underground stations.

A smoggy Bhogi as air pollution spikes manifold,"Residents in the city woke up to a smoggy morning on Saturday, with Bhogi celebrations being marked by the burning of old belongings and scrap.From 4am to 11am, there was a spike in PM2.5 levels much beyond the safe limit of 200, as per data from the National Air Quality Index measured at three monitoring stations - Alandur bus depot, Manali and IIT Madras. The level of particulate matter with a radius less than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5) touched 500 in Manali and crossed 300 near Alandur during this period.The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) monitored the Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) before and after Bhogi in all the 15 zones in the city, and found a higher value of PM10 (particulate matter with diameters of 10 micrometres or less) in at least 13 zones, when compared with the values recorded last year.Except in Meenambakkam and Sholinganallur, all the remaining zones saw an increase in PM10 levels over last year's values.In several zones, the PM10 levels spiked manifold - for instance in Thiruvottiyur, from 56 (before Bhogi) to 204. A similar spike was recorded in zones like Manali, Royapuram, Tondiarpet, Thiru Vi Ka Nagar and Ambattur.PM2.5 is a type of PM10 but is much more harmful to those inhaling it as it is composed of smaller particles. /PM2.5 levels above 200 indicate poor air quality which can cause breathing difficulties on prolonged exposure.On further increase beyond 300, it can cause respiratory illness upon prolonged exposure and levels from 401 to 500 mark severe air quality that could affect even healthy people without heart and lung problems.Doctors, however, cautioned the public not to panic.""As the spike is for a short period of time, healthy people may not see an immediate effect. Those with respiratory problems should avoid such smoke and take their medication. People can avoid the smoke to a certain extent but not totally,"" said Dr Prasanna K Thomas.Poor visibility puts road users at riskThe fog and thick smoke that wrapped the city due to burning of substances on the occassion of Bhogi, claimed the life of a mini-lorry driver near Kanagamma Chathiram near Tiruvallur, early on Saturday.The driver, Michael, 42, collided head on with a Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) bus plying from Tirupati to Chennai. Police said the accident happened at Kanagavalli Puram near Kanagamma Chathiram, when Michael was driving to a scrap iron merchant shop in Kanagamma Chathiram from Tiruvallur.The victim was crushed in the impact. Some of the passengers in the bus also suffered minor injuries.Inquiries revealed thatMichael failed to see the road, as the area was blanketed in dense smog. Police have registered a case under the IPC Section 304(a) (death caused due to negligence driving) against the bus driver.In another accident reported on Saturday morning at Pakkam, near Madurantakam on Chennai-Tiruchi National highway, three cars, one van and one mini-lorry collided one after the other due to smog. In this multiple collision, at least nine people including eight women travelling in the cars and van were injured.The injured people were treated as out-patients at the government hospital in Madurantakam. The accident occurred in spite of the road users driving with their head lights on, police said. Police have registered a case. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air quality bad even in evenings,"KOLKATA: Pollutants hung heavy in the ambient air of the city and refused to dissipate even in the evening when the ambient air tends to get cleaner. Throughout Sunday, according to US Co nsulate air-quality monitoring station, the air was hazardous (301-500 \xB5g/m3) with the PM2.5 count of city's air remaining above the 400-mark for too long. Health experts raised alarm against prolonged outdoor activities.On Sunday, Delhi's air could not match Kolkata's, where air quality degenerated sharply compared to that of the Capital. /Delhi's air oscillated between unhealthy (151-200) and very unhealthy (201-300). The Capital is considered to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. Kolkatans woke up to a hazy morning on Sunday with a thick layer of smog hanging low in the atmosphere of the city, bringing down the visibility below 800m.A high influx of moisture in the air (88% humidity) trapped the particulate matters in the lower level of the atmosphere without allowing them to escape, said an IMD official. From 7am to 4pm, the air mostly remained above 400-mark, which is seven times higher than the permissible limit.Smog consists of harmful particulate matters, mostly carbon, polycyclic acetyl hydrocarbons, water vapour and sometimes lead and sulphur dioxide, due to high vehicular pollution. With the ground radiating heat faster in winter, the cooler and heavier air hangs low, trapping particulate matters that can't escape the dense haze. Smog starts forming after 8pm and turns densest between 3am and 4am. It lasts till about 8am the next day, provided sun rays dissipate it. But on Sunday the haze refused to dissipate throughout the day.The US consulate reading, which has thrown up Kolkata as the most polluted city in India, has also sounded an alert from the World Health Organisation (WHO) - Kolkata's severe air pollution poses serious health risks, with suspended particulate matter emerging as the main health threat. The WHO health advisory has suggested against long-term exposure to pollutants to avoid serious health hazards.""Unfortunately, pollution is not on anyone's agenda here. There will be no action till the court intervenes,"" said green activist Subhas Datta. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Burning chemical waste chokes Airoli, Ghansoli, K'khairane","Navi Mumbai: Residents of Ghansoli, Airoli and Koparkhairane are complaining of unbearable odour from burning of chemical waste dumped along the Palm Beach extension road, between Koparkhairane and Ghansoli. Some residents are planning to launch an online petition soon to voice their concern about the brazen air pollution from the toxic gases emanating from illegal dumping and burning of chemical waste near the proposed civic sports complex in Ghansoli. Eyewitnesses say that trucks loaded with chemical waste are coming from Mumbai at night. /But civic authorities have found no clue so far. Thick smoke from the burning chemical waste is covering the nodes and adding to the health risks of children and elderly. Many have complained of breathlessness, skin rashes and burning sensation in the eyes. Ghansoli residents have threatened a protest march to focus on the inefficiency of the authorities to check this. The garbage apparently includes medical waste too. ""We will soon mobilise people for an online petition against the burning of chemical waste here which may cause a man made disaster,"" said a resident Shirish Patil. Neighbouring Koparkhairane, Talvali, Rabale and Airoli residents are also inhaling foul odour from the fumes of the toxic waste. Dattatray Nagare, assistant NMMC commissioner told TOI, ""Our team visited the spot but failed to find anyone. Our officials will be paying frequent visits to nab the culprits. We have also asked the local police to deploy beat marshals at night and will soon disconnect the road leading to the dumping site."" Angry citizens have also threatened to file a PIL against erring officials.

Pollution-eating trees can cleanse city's air,"ed:sajuCoimbatore: Many of us romanticise the city weather by calling the haze in early morning and night hours mist or fog. But, the right word for it is smog-a mix of fog and a layer of polluted air-said researchers at the the Forest College and Research Institute at Mettupalayam, who have also found a solution to the malady-trees.""The situation in the city is becoming worse due to vehicular and industrial pollution,"" said Prasanthrajan, an associate professor of Silviculture. ""For the last two years, we have been collecting pollution levels at various locations in the city using a mobile ambient air quality monitor. /For every pollutant, we have also found specific varieties of trees that could be planted,"" he told TOI.It has been scientifically proven that trees absorb pollutants and are the best bet against them, said A Balasubramanian, professor and head of the Silviculture department. ""We have prepared a detailed proposal that includes a list of trees that can be planted for specific pollutants present at various locations in the city. We plan to tie up with the city corporation and plant the saplings under the smart city project,"" he said.The researchers said that while trees use carbon-dioxide for photosynthesis, they also absorb other pollutants. ""If we plant them at highly polluted locations, we can help reduce pollutant levels in the area,"" said Prasanthrajan. ""We conducted tests at the forest college campus and found that the trees successfully reduce pollutants. We will make recommendations to the civic body for these specific varieties to be planted along roads,"" he said.Meanwhile, corporation officials said they also plan an extensive plantation drive in reserve sites to improve air quality. ""The city's climate has changed in the last few decades. To bring it back, bio-remedies are the best bet,"" said an official.The researchers also used data from the 30 air quality monitors in the city, corporation officials said. ""The researchers are working our various bio-remedies for water and air pollution inside the city limits. They are also developing pollutant resistant trees that could be planted on the lake bund,"" an official added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Best-laid plans won't make air safe by 2050,"NEW DELHI: A recent study has found that Delhi needs to take very aggressive steps to reduce emissions, including a complete prohibition on crop residue burning in neighboring states, to even bring down people's average PM2.5 exposure closer to the national safe standard by 2050.According to 'Burden of Disease Attributable to Major Air Pollution Sources in India', released on January 11, even if emission standards of vehicles improve as planned, thermal power plants and industries meet energy efficiency targets as expected, and cleaner technologies replace biomass burning at homes and in brick kilns, Delhi's PM2.5 exposure will continue to rise till 2050.The study on people's PM2.5 exposure from different emission sources also simulates future scenarios depending on the nature of action taken to control air pollution. For example, while Delhi's annual average exposure in 2015 was about 140 micrograms per cubic metres, in 2030 - under the scenario 'S2' - the annual average concentration only reduces to 120 micrograms per cubic metres but rises after that, hovering around the same levels as in 2015. Only in 'S3', when very stringent action has been taken, the annual average starts declining to a little over 80 in 2030 and a little under it in 2050, but continues to be higher than the national safe standard of 40 micrograms per cubic metres.According to the study's authors - from IIT Bombay, the US-based Health Effects Institute and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, they used a global chemical transport model. /Chandra Venkataraman, climate scientist at IIT Bombay, said it was a threestep process where detailed emission databases were developed that included nearly all emission sources. These are then deployed in an air quality model and also takes into account atmospheric chemistry.The scenarios assessed include business as usual, S2-when energy efficiency targets for thermal power plants and industries are met as per India's submissions during the Paris agreement in 2015, vehicle emission standards are improved as planned in the auto fuel policy, and cleaner technologies have replaced solid fuel burning at homes, brick kilns and industries, and S3 - when crop residue burning has fully stopped and low carbon growth has become a norm. Most north Indian states that presented the state-level assessments fail to meet PM2.5 standard in 2050, said the authors.According to the study, biomass burning at homes, followed by open waste or biomass burning, and then dust and coal fly ash are the highest contributors to the PM2.5 exposure in Delhi.Nationally, if no action is taken, population exposures to PM2.5 are likely to increase by over 40% by 2050. ""Exposures increase from 74 micrograms per cubic metres in 2015 to 106 in 2050. Exposure levels are kept close to the 2015 levels under an ambitious S2 scenario. Only under the most active reductions under S3, exposures are likely to reduce by nearly 35% from 2015 to 2050, reaching about 48 micrograms per cubic metres.""If no action is taken, the burden of disease will also grow substantially by 2050. Compared with nearly 1.1 million deaths in 2015, deaths attributable to the PM2.5 exposure are expected to rise to 3.6 millions.Despite polluted cities like Delhi making headlines all the time, the study also found more than 75% of premature deaths attributable to air pollution were in rural areas. But exposure to PM2.5 in cities and rural areas was found to be similar. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Lucknow: You breathed 'good' air for 17 days in '17,"LUCKNOW: The last year had been too severe on the health of Lucknowites who got to breathe 'good' quality air for 17 days only. Though the high air pollution issue hogged news headlines only in the month of November, the air quality in the state capital had been of 'very poor' and 'severe' quality for 76% days of the year, says a report by Centre For Environment and Energy Development (CEED).An analysis of Air Quality Index (AQI) data released daily by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) by CEED further revealed that city recorded high pollution levels for 61consecutive days in 2017 with November being the most polluted month followed by December and July the least. Analysis reveals that air quality was 'satisfactory' only for 19% of days in 2017 with AQI ranging between 51to 100 - enough to cause minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people. /AQI is average of values of pollution levels recorded from various locations in city. For seven days in November, city was amongst most polluted in country figuring under 'severe' air quality category with very high pollution level that affects even healthy people and impacts those with existing diseases.Lalbagh was most polluted in cityPollution levels were seven times higher than the national safety limits with AQI over 400. The state capital also attained the dubious distinction of twice being the most polluted city in the country in November.Lalbagh was the most polluted location in the city among the three monitored by CPCB. The annual mean PM2.5 concentration here was 130 microgram per cubic metre of air followed by Talkatora with 129 and Aliganj with 104. ""Burning of wood, continuous construction and heavy vehicular load deteriorates air quality of the city. In November and December, air pollution level spiked due to non-dissipation of particulate matter,"" said Indian Institute of Toxicology Research director Alok Dhawan.He said that besides particulate matter PM10 and PM 2.5, traces of ultra and superfine particles were also monitored in Lucknow's air by IITR. ""There is a need for remedial measures to improve Lucknow's air. These could include halting construction work and reducing automobile load,"" he added.""High pollution levels in the city throughout the year is a serious concern. The state government should chalk out an affirmative Clean Air Action Plan with a time-bound implementation to control pollution,"" said CEED CEO Ramapati Kumar. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Bhanpur water dangerous to drink, govt admits to NGT","Bhopal: This will shock Bhopalis. The state government on Wednesday told the central bench of National Green Tribunal (NGT) just why Bhanpur dumping site is dangerous - drinking water in Bhanpur has hazardous levels of coliform contamination at 1600 MPN (most probable number) per 100ml. Not to talk of the air pollution it causes in the area. It's ideal not to have any coliform in water but the permissible limit in India 500 MPM. /What's more, it took the government 15 months to submit the report. The tribunal had asked for the information on October 4, 2016, and the state finally tabled the compliance report on Wednesday .The green bench, which is currently headed by only expert member SS Garbyal, took the report on record, while rejecting the state's claim that they were not aware of any order asking them to submit a report by the 15th of every month. ""The tribunal rejects the reason of state government that has been attributed to non-compliance of NGT orders issued on October, 2 2016. The reason is not acceptable at all,"" the expert member said.According to the October 2016 order, the state and MPPCB were to submit reports regarding contamination and pollution of underground water - including testing of samples at various points at different radius from the existing site of Bhanpura - by the 15th of every month. However, not a single report was submitted by the respondents so far, citing that a copy of the order was not uploaded on the official website.According to the first report submitted by the respondents, water samples from six locations of Bhanpur site that are the source of drinking water for the area were taken for tests. After examination, it was found that the water at all six locations has coliform bacteria 1600 times more than its permissible limit. The report also reveals that air quality of the area exceeds permissible levels of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM). High RSPM count can lead to several diseases and worsen others.""The report shows that RSPM is close to 130, which is much higher than National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The state has tagged the drinking water as dangerous for human consumption because of the high coliform count,"" the expert member said during the hearing.The bench was hearing the case of applicant Subhash C Pandey, who alleges heavy metal contamination of the site. The report doesn't mention anything about heavy metal.The higher RSPM is attributed to heavy traffic in the area. The report claims that the dumping site has been closed as of now and garbage is being dumped at a new site, Aadampur Chawni. The applicant pointed out that the Bhanpur has been partially closed and that the closure has been done ""unscientifically"". ""The state has started creating another Bhanpur at Aadampur as no scientific procedure is being followed,"" he alleged. In response, the green bench instructed Pandey to come up with a new application to prove it.""In the next 10 days, the state will file another report of compliance, which should mention the steps and actions taken. The applicant, in the meanwhile, will also get groundwater tested to cross check the report,"" the green bench said.Nilesh Dubey, deputy director, urban development department and K K Shrivastav, an expert in solid waste management, had earlier submitted a timeline for Bhanpur closure and making a new site at Aadampur functional till the month of October 2017. The tribunal in this regard asked for the steps taken for the preparation of the new site at Aadampur ""as both these projects cannot be looked into isolation.""NGT has directed BMC to clean the dump at Bhanpur, which activists claim is 80 feet high and has polluted groundwater up to 500 metres below. Bhanpur has been a trenching ground for four decades and now poses a threat to local population. The matter has been listed for February, 13 2018. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
CPCB plans study to know health impact of pollution,"NEW DELHI: Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is going to commission a study based on data from government hospitals across the country to get an accurate picture of health impact of air pollution. Reacting to a new study, Burden of Disease Attributable to Major Air Pollution Sources in India, by US-based Health Effects Institute, CPCB scientists said it was not tailored for Indian conditions. The board is developing a statement of purpose, which will be ready in a month, for the long-term epidemiological study. /The study by Health Effects Institute referred to the Global Burden of Disease analysis for India, which said that air pollution contributed to more than 10% of the deaths in the country. In 2015, premature mortality attributed to air pollution contributed to nearly 1.1 million deaths, of which 75% were in rural areas. ""Before arriving at any conclusion, we have to understand that their methodology and our methodology of evaluating health impacts can be very different. They are depending on extrapolated data. We, along with the ministry of health and family welfare, are developing a methodology for Indian conditions. We will characterise particulate matter, and there will be a monthly profile of PM levels and chemistry of particulates,"" said Dipankar Saha, head of CPCB's air lab, adding that ""we will conduct a long-term exposure study"".Saha was speaking on the sidelines of CPCB's technical meet with the media on Thursday. CPCB member secretary A Sudhakar said, ""Morbidity and mortality rates due to air pollution are being reported in the media without the knowledge of how these are being calculated. Many of these reports extrapolate data for the last 10 years...sometimes the gaps in the data are huge...there is no such study that tells us how much of it is directly caused by air pollution.""CPCB's 'Epidemiological study on effect of air pollution on human health in Delhi', published in 2012, stated that ""there is increasing evidence to suggest that exposure to these pollutants elicits adverse health effects, often at levels well below the current WHO guidelines"". In August 2015, the environment ministry had told Parliament that more than 35,000 people had died due to acute respiratory infections across India between January 2006 and the middle of 2015, but did not attribute it directly to air pollution. However, the Global Burden of Disease report had found that exposure to PM2.5 may cause various diseases, including ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and stroke.

New thermal power plants will have to comply with emission standards: NGT,"NEW DELHI: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the union environment ministry to not grant environmental clearance to any new thermal power plant unless they comply with emission standards notified in December 2015.NGT was hearing a petition by environmental activist, Sunil Dahiya on the delay in implementing the standards and the resulting air pollution from thermal power plants across the country. The principal bench of NGT also directed the MoEFCC to not grant any environmental clearance to new thermal power plants unless they show mechanisms in place to implement and achieve the emission standards and water consumption requirements as stipulated in the new notification, said a statement from Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment (LIFE). Advocates Ritwick Dutta and Rahul Chowdhury of LIFE who are representing the petitioner said the MoEFCC had informed NGT that they had moved SC recently seeking an extension of the deadline for implementation of the standards. The standards were to be implemented within two years of the date of notification-December 7, 2015. The notification categorises thermal plants into three categories-those installed before December 31, 2003, those installed after 2003 but before December 31, 2016 and those installed after January 1, 2017. The new standards aim to reduce particulate matter (PM), SO2 and NOx emissions from thermal plants which are known to be one of the leading sources of air pollution in India. /Against a standard of 150 mg/NM3 for PM before 2015, the new standards prescribe 30 mg/NM3 for PM and 100 mg/NM3 for SO2 and NOx for all plants that come up after January 1, 2017. There were no standards for SO2 and NOx before these new standards were notified.The petition refers to a study by Greenpeace India ""Out of Sight: How coal burning advances India's air pollution crisis"" which uses satellite data to highlight that largest air pollution hotspots and highest sources of SO2 and NO2 emission growth between 2009 and 2015. The hotspots indicate contribution from industrial clusters and coal fired power plants. The report also talks about secondary particulate formation from precursor gases SO2, NO2 and ammonia in coal consuming regions. A recent study by ""Burden of Disease Attributable to Major Air Pollution Sources in India"" also found that PM 2.5 exposure was second highest from coal burning, after residential biomass burning. Dahiya has appealed that NGT also direct MoEFCC to issue directions to power plants on submitting an implementation plan for complying with standards and information regarding compliance be made online.The petition also refers to the minutes of the expert appraisal committee (EAC) for thermal projects meetings which reveal that environmental clearance was granted to new thermal power plant projects but the new standards were not followed.

Bio-medical waste mgmt training kickstarted in city,"Thane: In an attempt to ensure that 100 per cent of the bio-medical waste generated in Thane city is segregated and disposed safely, city based non government organisations and the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Thane last Friday.NGOs R-Nisarg Foundation and Enviro Vigil along with the association kickstarted a first-of-its-kind bio-medical waste management training programme for healthcare professionals. While the 1,800 plus medical organisations in the city generate over two tonnes of hazardous biomedical waste on a daily basis, as much as 600kg or 30 per cent of this toxic waste is not segregated properly according to the data accumulated by Enviro Vigil.Environmental experts working in this industry asserted that while 30 per cent may seem like a small number, this mismanagement of bio-medical waste, however small, could not only result in the spreading of infections and diseases for those handling the misplaced toxic waste, but also affect the environment through incorrect disposal.""The segregation of bio-medical waste is a four-pronged system. While the yellow coloured bag is used for disposing biomedical waste that needs to be burnt like body organs, blood, soiled waste and so on, the red bag is for plastic, rubber and other recyclable waste. /The blue bag is for glass and metal and the white canister is for sharp items like razors and needles,"" said Dr Lata Ghanshamnani, founder of R-Nisarg Foundation, while addressing a crowd of 100 plus healthcare professionals at the first training session in Naupada.""Putting the waste from the yellow bag in the others could affect the health of those further segregating the waste as they could come in touch with the infected blood and fluids. Meanwhile, putting the recyclable waste like rubber and plastic in the yellow bag could result in high air pollution levels. This is why it is crucial that this hazardous waste is managed safely,"" she added.The training programme will continue for the coming three months after which this entire system will be digitalised. ""After the training, each medical organisation will be given an identity and password to a special website, where they can update the waste segregated, generated and handed over to us,"" said Prasad Date, CEO of Enviro Vigil.

CPCB calls states for reviewing solid waste management,"Nagpur: Concerned over lax implementation of solid waste management by many states, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) will be reviewing steps taken by the authorities to comply with environmental norms.CPCB, a statutory organization under the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC), is convening a meeting of around 24 states on January 23 in New Delhi. Expected to be chaired by the board's chairman SP Singh Parihar, the meeting aims at individual assessment of states. ""We have called the state urban departments, pollution control boards and municipal bodies. /The states have been segregated and divided into groups,"" said Sunil Nigam, a scientist at CPCB.Apart from assessing waste management problems of different states, CPCB also plans to take recommendations from all the bodies. ""We want to know the steps taken by states to implement the National Green Tribunal's directions on municipal solid waste,"" added Nigam.While hearing the petition filed by Almitra Patel seeking directions on effective management of solid waste in India, the NGT principal bench had stated that top officials of state governments and municipal bodies will be liable for prosecution if they violate the rules and orders of the tribunal.According to the board officials, scientific dumping of municipal solid waste is still not being done in many places. ""Scientific landfill site is the best way of managing waste. Only 5% of the municipal solid waste should reach the site, rest all can be utilized but urban bodies are not taking the required initiatives. Dumping of waste is illegal,"" said Nigam. Fires at garbage dump yards continue to be a common problem in urban cities. ""We are taking the issue very seriously and have recommended local bodies to use foam slurry on surroundings of landfill site to control fire outbreaks,"" said Nigam.Dump yard fires are caused due to release of methane gas during the decomposition of organic waste. ""Apart from it, burning of unsegregated garbage including paper, plastic, heavy metals and other materials releases toxic fumes,"" added Nigam. As reported by TOI earlier, burning of waste not just causes large-scale air pollution but is a life hazard too. Burning of some materials, like plastic, emits toxic gases like dioxins and furans which are believed to cause cancer. Even the National Air Quality Index of MoEF&CC warns about severe impact of increasing particulate matter levels on public health and mentions a strong correlation between ambient PM concentrations and increase in mortality and hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases.

'70% of kidney donors in country are women',"PATNA: Nearly 2.20 lakh cases of kidney failures are reported and only 8,000 patients undergo kidney transplantation every year in the country, medical director at a Gujarat-based institute, Dr Mahesh Desai, quoted a figure of Union ministry of health and family welfare on Tuesday.Dr Desai was in the city with his team to train the doctors of Paras HMRI Hospital in kidney transplantation. He said the kidney transplantation facility is available in only 250 hospitals. ""Around 70% of the kidney donors are women,"" he revealed, adding post-operation medicines are often costly and to be taken throughout life. /Nephrologists and urologists attribute kidney failures mainly to diabetes and uncontrolled blood pressure. ""Diabetes is the main cause of kidney failure, followed by uncontrolled blood pressure, regular kidney infections and abuse or overdose of drugs without a doctor's prescription, especially painkillers,"" said Dr Ajay Kumar, director of the Institute of Urology, Nephrology and Transplantation at Paras HMRI Hospital. Another leading cause of kidney failure among women is urine infection during pregnancy, he said. Smoking, air pollution and adulterated food also affect kidney functioning and harm the organ in the long run.Dr Kumar said the recurrence of stone formation may also lead to kidney failures. ""With the recurrence of stones, the kidney gets infected regularly. Although no set cause of kidney stones is known,"" he added.Head of its nephrology department, Dr Shashi Kumar, said the main challenges being faced in the state was the absence of donors and lack of awareness. ""Kidney patients of Bihar usually visit other states for transplantation. We get nearly 1500 to 1800 patients for dialysis every month,"" he added.""We will set up a fund to help the underprivileged people in kidney operation. We will also carry out the operation at a nominal rate,"" Paras HMRI director Dr Talat Halim said.Paras HMRI is the third hospital in the state to start kidney transplantation after Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) and another private hospital. It is also the first hospital to receive National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers (NABH) certification. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pollution hurting health of traffic cops: NHRC,"NEW DELHI: The National Human Rights Commission has issued notices to the Centre and all the states/UTs on the issue of vehicular pollution affecting the respiratory system and even the reproductive health of traffic cops. Taking cognisance of an application filed by Dr Sanjay Kulshreshtha, an expert on road traffic hazards, NHRC has also stated that most of the state governments don't provide any extra allowances or health facilities to the traffic police personnel. Kulshreshtha had sought NHRC's intervention while raising the issue of right to health of the personnel of traffic police across the country, stating that the high air pollution is causing reduced life expectancy among them. /The commission has asked Union home secretary and chief secretaries of all the states to send a detailed response in the matter within eight weeks. In his application to NHRC chairman Justice (retd) H L Dattu on January 4, Dr Kulshreshtha said traffic policemen are the worst sufferers of vehicular pollution because they perform duties at crossings where pollution is maximum. ""If we stand at some moderately busy crossing and start counting total number of vehicles passing from all four directions in his duty hours, we may find that their number is anywhere between 1-2 lakhs or even more, "" Dr Kulshreshtha said in the application. He also mentioned that studies have shown that within 5-6 years these policemen develop pollution induced diseases. ""In cases where the posting place is in the heavily polluted area, these diseases can develop much earlier. This vehicular pollution mainly affects their respiratory system, however, there is no part or system in the body which is immune to it. Besides, they are also prone to have some other diseases like cardiac, skin, migraine and even reproductive system. All these cause significant morbidity, affecting the quality of life and also the life expectancy,"" he adds. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
AMC indifferent as waste burning continues unabated,"Aurangabad: Burning piles of waste has become a common sight in the city. On the wee hours of Sunday, scrupulous elements set afire a pile of garden waste in front of Cidco office on Jalgaon Road. The fire damaged a tree which is now on the verge of collapse posing a threat to motorists and pedestrians. /Social activist Rahul Ingle had called fire brigade to douse off the fire. But his various calls to AMC officials to take care of the tree went futile.Nevertheless, one can see residents and shop owners burning their solid waste in front of their houses and shops anywhere in the city. Citizens in some areas like N-3 Cidco say that they get a large quantity of garden waste. However, the sanitary staff refuse to pick their garden waste and ask them to compost it. This waste including dried leaves and tree branches are often found being burnt. Many people running grocery shops, lottery shops, garages also frequently burn their waste in front of their shop. The waste that includes cardboard, lottery tickets, plastic, wrappers and tyres causes a nasty smell, harmful smoke and particulate matter. When asked the reason for burning waste, they say that they dont get garbage collection vehicle during their business hours or on convenient time and they have no option but to burn it for disposal. Surprisingly, many government and private establishment can also be seen engaging in waste burning.The waste burnt not only adds to the air pollution but also removes the possibility of recycling the waste. According to the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016, no waste generator shall throw, burn or burry the solid waste generated by him, on streets, open public spaces outside his premises or in the drain or water bodies and the ministry of environment, forest and climate change also holds the municipal body responsible of ensuring that this does not take place.However, the civic body has been so far indifferent to the nuisance. When reached for a comment on the situation, AMC additional commissioner Shrikrishna Bhalsing said the municipal body can penalise people for littering and unscrupulous waste dumping. ""We can also charge penalty from those burning waste. I will issue orders to the sanitary inspectors working under the municipal corporation and ask them to maintain a strict vigil to keep a check on such activities, Bhalsing said. Speaking on the tree that was damaged in Sundays fire at Jalgaon Road,"" the civic officer said that he will ask the garden superintendent to look into it. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Kolkatans walk for cleaner air, ask for urgent action","KOLKATA: City residents on Sunday hit the streets to spread awareness on the dangers of Kolkata's declining air quality index.The march organised by Kolkata Clean Air (KCA) - an umbrella body for several green organizations campaigning for city's better environment - witnessed hundreds of concerned citizens, including schoolgoers, university researchers and elderly citizens demanding proactive solutions to air quality issues. All participants wore masks and told passersby how particulate matters of size 2.5 microns are so tiny that there is no filter, available in the market, which can prevent them from entering the lungs through windpipe. ""Their placards read: 'Be part of solution, not pollution', 'We share a common dream of making Kolkata one of the most liveable and climate friendly cities in the world', and 'Don't smoke your future,""said Gari Maitra of KCA.Ajay Mittal of Global Shaper said, ""As a proud Kolkatan, I can't accept the 'world's most polluted city' tag. /None of us are immune to the hazardous effects of air pollution. It is important for all of us to take immediate measures to prevent ourselves from exposure to such pollutants. All of us have to play to bring back breathable, fresh air.""Environment NGO Switch-ON's founder, Vinay Jaju, said, ""The march will follow a sustained campaign to drive policy level actions and on-ground action, especially involving youths. We need to stop pollution at sources. At the same time, we must adopt more sustainable lifestyles on an individual level as climate change is the biggest threat to mankind today.""Kolkata's air quality has reportedly become one of the worst in the world. It is high time that some drastic action is taken to tackle air pollution, said Ekta Jaju of Switch-ON. Earth Day Network country director (India) Karuna Singh said, ""We joined the Clean Air campaign with the conviction that it will rally people together for actions to reverse the negative air quality.""

ASI says repeated 'xz' mud pack treatment of Taj Mahal not advisable,"AGRA: The chemical branch of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has stated that there is a dire need to minimise pollution load in the city, which is adversely affecting the beauty of Taj, by strictly implementing various guidelines, as clay pack treatment to the monument may not be advisable repeatedly. This recommendation forms part of a Preliminary study conducted by the ASI on Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) in the ambience of Taj Mahal. The study categorically states that repeated mud pack treatment may affect the stability of the marble surface too. /The report has also invited opinion from agencies carrying out research in the field of conservation for selection of preservatives that can enhance durability of ""clay pack treatment"" and stability of the treated surface of marble. According to monitoring data of year 2016 and 2017, the suspended particulate matter (SPM) was high, therefore it is necessary to take extra steps to minimise its levels. Experts say that particulate matter, such as dust and fumes have damaged the painted surfaces, fabrics and the building. ""Due to their abrasive nature, SPM can cause damage to exposed surfaces when they are driven by wind at high velocities"", experts say.Superintendent Archaeologist chemist, Dr MK Bhatnagar said that over the years, lesser rain and large gap in rainfall periods has led to higher accumulation of pollutant in the atmosphere. He said analysis of the data in the study show that rainfall in the Taj trapezium zone is mostly between mid-June to early September, hence the concentration of SPM was unusually higher in the months of April and November onwards. He said the study indicates that emission of air pollutants from various localised sources, such as burning of fossil fuels and biomass, smoke from local vehicular load, particulate matter from heavy construction activities and fine dust particles are caused from soil erosion due to lack of sufficient greenery and plantation and are major contributors of air pollution from north west and west directions in and around the Taj Mahal. The present phase of study comprises database analysis while in the second phase, the identification of direction of wind and identification of constituents of SPM will be carried out, said Bhatnagar. Earlier, a joint study to look into the factors behind the discolouration of the world heritage site by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, ASI and US-based Georgia Institute of Technology (Atlanta) and University of Wisconsin (Madison) had revealed that air pollution is the real cause behind the damage to the monument. The study was published in Environmental Science & Technology journal in December 2014. As per recommendation of Parliamentary Standing Committee in the year 2015, the science branch has been carrying out scientific cleaning by using clay pack therapy for entire main mausoleum of Taj Mahal including minarets.The monument had been given the mud-pack treatment four times in the past. While the maiden mud-pack treatment took place in 1994, the second and third ones were given in 2001 and 2008. In May 2014 to get rid of decades of paan and gutkha stains left by the visitors on the interior walls of the world heritage building.Professor SN Tripathi of the Centre for Environmental Science and Engineering, IIT-Kanpur, had cautioned earlier that with regular cleaning, the original colour, original texture and shining from the marble surfaces will be gone forever.

"ASI says repeated ""mud pack"" treatment of Taj not advisable","Agra: The restoration of the Taj Mahal using mud packs is no longer a viable option as the Archaeological Survey of India says that the repeated use of fuller’s earth may affect the stability of the marble surface. The chemical branch of the ASI has suggested that the only way to save the iconic 17th-century monument is to reduce pollution in the city. The recommendation comes after ASI’s preliminary study on the suspended particulate matter (SPM) around the mausoleum. /The study categorically states that the repeated mud pack treatment may affect the stability of the marble surface, and has asked research agencies to suggest other preservatives that can “enhance durability of clay pack treatment” and stability of the treated surface of marble.

"PUC centres in Gurugram run on rickshaws, mock green rules","GURUGRAM: Every petrol pump in the state must have a centre for checking vehicular pollution on its premises - the state government has said in a recent order, bringing focus back on illegal ones that run on mobile vans and cycle rickshaws in Gurugram and other parts of Haryana, undermining their very purpose.Following the order issued on January 25, TOI went on a reality check on Monday and found at least 10 illegal pollution checking centres or 'pollution under control' (PUC) centres operating in the city's prominent localities, including Golf Course Road, Rajiv Chowk, near Guru Dronacharya Metro station, Gurugram-Faridabad Road, Gurugram bus stand, Jharsa Road, Sector 4-7 Chowk and sectors 43, 51 and 56. All of them are running on mobile vans or cycle rickshaws.There are only 138 authorised PUCs in the district, as against over 250 petrol pumps. Again, all these PUCs are not located at the petrol pumps.A PUC should have a cabin (with minimum 2.5m length, 2m width and 2m height) for placing the analyser and computer hardware. The cabin shall be appropriately designed to protect the system from heat, direct sunlight and rain, and should have proper ventilation. /But, those illegal mobile centres don't meet these norms.Moreover, a PUC operator should be a motor mechanic/auto mechanic/scooter mechanic/diesel mechanic from an ITI or have an equivalent qualification. However, these mobile centres are being run by single operators, who are not even 'semi-literate'.The operator of one such mobile centres told TOI that checking pollution of vehicles was not ""rocket science"". ""Even if a vehicle is standing one kilometre away, I can tell you if it is polluting. We don't have modern equipment like those centres at petrol pumps and we issue a certificate after looking at the colour of the smoke emitted by a vehicle. We also check if a vehicle is making any noise,"" he said, requesting anonymity.Also, the Environment Protection Rules, 1986, mandates that all petrol and diesel-run vehicles should comply with the mass emission standards. But it seems even city's vehicle owners do not mind going to such mobile centres for a 'fitness' certification and mock the green rules.""When we find it difficult to get pollution fitness certificate, we are forced to go to these centres. For instance, there is no PUC near Subhash Chowk (where I live). The nearest PUC is on Golf Course Extension Road, around two kilometres from my place. I prefer to get it done at a rickshaw centre near Rajiv Chowk than going all the way to Golf Course Extension Road,"" said Raju Kumar, a car owner.Officials at HSPCB expressed helplessness. ""Fake (illegal) PUCs in the city are major cause of air pollution. Many times, we have informed RTA about these centres,"" said an HSPCB official.When asked, RTA Pradeep Dahiya said, ""As soon as we get the notification, we will carry out an inspection to ascertain the number of petrol pumps that don't have PUCs. All petrol pumps will be directed to allocate space for setting up PUCs. The step will help bring down vehicular emissions."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Are we breathing poison in Doon?,"DEHRADUN: Successive air quality surveys are presenting an alarming trend of cities in Uttarakhand in particular state capital Dehradun -- considered a green haven with clean and fresh air -– being in fact heavily polluted. A recent report by the India unit of global environment group Greenpeace has ranked Dehradun as the fifth most polluted city in the country with PM10 (particulate matter) levels at 238 micrograms per cubic metre (permissible limit is 100). Other cities in the state also present a similar picture. In Rudrapur, average PM10 levels have gone from 125 last year to 142 this year. Similarly, Haridwar has gone from 123 to 128, and Kashipur from 108 to 121. The Central Pollution Control Board's ambient air quality index of 273 cities, data for which was presented in the Lok Sabha last month, had also put the PM10 value of Dehradun at 241 making the city’s pollution levels worse than bigger towns such as Noida, Kanpur and Ghaziabad. /A survey by city-based NGO Society of Pollution and Environmental Conservation Scientists (SPECS) sometime back had found that rampant construction in the city — particularly that of flyovers — was contributing a great deal to air pollution. According to the NGO, the PM10 levels during flyover construction in some parts of the city rose to exceedingly high values of 487 micro grams per meter cube. ”When Balliwala and Ballupur flyovers were being constructed from 2014 onwards, no protection mechanism was deployed to prevent dust particles from flying in the air because of which the pollution levels in those areas increased manifold,” said Brij Mohan Sharma, founder, SPECS. He added that “high toxicity dust — which is created when material such as concrete and mortar is used as was the case during the flyover construction — has the potential to cause serious health issues.” Dr Rameshwar Pandey, professor of pulmonary medicine at Doon Medical College told TOI that diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease — which are often pollution-induced — have increased in the city in the last few years. “Skin diseases and eye-related ailments triggered by pollutants have also seen a rise,” he added. According to environmentalist Ravi Chopra, founder director of the Doon-based People’s Science Institute, the pollution problem has been compounded by the “merciless cutting of trees.” “ Trees are being cut everywhere in the name of widening of roads. We need to plant more trees so that pollutants can be absorbed. Also, a stringent check on motor vehicles is required to ensure they have the required pollution control certificates."" Another city-based think-tank Gati Foundation, which has been studying the causes of poor air quality in Dehradun, attributed besides emissions from vehicles and rampant construction, the burning of waste in the open(despite a ban by NGT) as an important factor damaging the air quality. Rishabh Shrivastava, policy analyst, Gati Foundation, told TOI, “If air quality has to be improved, then a real-time air monitoring system should be put in place in the city. The current monitoring in the city is manual and data is made available on a monthly basis. Also eco-friendly public transport should be developed along with regularisation of construction.” Meanwhile pollution control board officials attributed the high pollution levels to geographical reasons primarily. SS Rana, regional head (Garhwal mandal) of the state pollution control board said, “Doon valley is like a bowl and surrounded by mountain ranges because of which the particulate matter gets trapped in it. Also, any data of a pollution survey should be interpreted keeping in mind that the surveys are done on dynamic data, so any area which may be highly polluted when a reading is taken can become normal in a few hours.” DEADLY DOON? •A survey by the Uttarakhand Pollution Control Board (UPCB) for the period between January and September last year had shown that air pollution in major commercial areas in Dehradun was much higher than areas in five other cities in the state namely Rishikesh, Haridwar, Haldwani , Kashipur and Rudrapur •While all the cities recorded pollution levels much greater than the approved PM 10 levels, commercial areas around ISBT in the capital city followed by Raipur Road and Clock Tower had average PM 10 levels ranging between a whopping 189 to 282 µg/m3 •While commercial areas in ISBT recorded average PM 10 levels at 282.493 µg/m3, Raipur Road’s commercial/residential areas had average PM 10 levels of 205.479 µg/m3 and Clock Tower 189.483. The highest PM 10 concentration of 330.42 was recorded in the area around Himalayan Drug, ISBT •The average PM 10 levels in the Nagar Palika Parishad area of Rishikesh were recorded as 134.922 µg/m3, while the industrial belt of SIDCUL in Haridwar had PM 10 levels of 97.22µg/m3. The commercial area around Govt Hospital, Haldwani had PM 10 levels of 121.91 while the particulate matter levels in Kashipur and Rudrapur stood at 117.644 and 130.813 µg/m3 respectively For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Budget 2018: Government must deliver, says CSE","NEW DELHI: ""This is a very important Budget because of three things: One, it recognizes the crippling agrarian crisis that grips India today. Two, it provides a very substantial security net for health, in the form of the health insurance scheme. And three, it gives poor tribals and forest dwellers a win-win option by supporting development of the bamboo sector,"" said Sunita Narain, director general, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), commenting on the Union Budget of 2018, presented here today by India's finance minister Arun Jaitley. On healthcare:One of the key interventions the Union Budget proposes is in the field of health insurance. /Finance minister Jaitley has announced a flagship national health insurance scheme which will cover 10 crore vulnerable families, with a coverage of Rs 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary hospitalization. It must be acknowledged that this significant measure might make healthcare accessible to some of the poorest in the country - provided it reaches them. The experience with previous insurance schemes tells us that most such measures tend to end as damp squibs in the absence of effective implementation and monitoring. Narain points out that putting in place such schemes are essentially curative steps - what India desperately needs today is preventive action as well. The country is witnessing a massive surge in incidence of non-communicable diseases (see our latest reports on it in Body Burden: State of India's Health, /<a href=""http://www.cseindia.org"">www.cseindia.org</a>/), largely triggered by a whole range of environmental factors from air pollution and toxins in the environment to junk food. Over 61 per cent of all deaths in India are due to NCDs. The Budget does nothing to address this concern. On air pollution:The issue of air pollution - which has steadily acquired the status of a national emergency -- has been tackled rather briefly through a ""special scheme"" to manage crop residues. The scheme offers to help the governments of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi-NCR by subsidising the machinery for management of crop residues. Says Narain: ""The scheme is welcome. The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) has already endorsed the report of the sub-committee set up by the Prime Minister's Office on this issue. However, the scheme has to be implemented quickly - the machines must come before next winter, the season when stubble burning is usually at its peak. The clock is ticking."" Anumita Roychowdhury, CSE's executive director and the head of its Right to Clean Air campaign, adds: ""The Budget does not seem to recognize the urban air pollution challenge as an issue of national importance. Air pollution is not a problem that afflicts just the Delhi-NCR region and its adjoining states - every major city in India is now burdened with it."" CSE analysts say that two key sectors that need immediate intervention in the form of enhanced infusion of funds - mobility and clean fuels - have been ignored. On agriculture and livestock:The Economic Survey 2018 has pointed out that agriculture in India is in a state of serious crisis. In a climate-risked world, there is worse that can be expected in the years to come - and the most severely affected would be the marginal and small farmers, who make up the bulk of the farming fraternity in India. For these farmers, their livestock - cows, buffaloes, goats, horses etc -- forms the most valuable resource; it is their key to survival in difficult times. The Budget's announcement of the Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund and the Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (with allocation of Rs 10,000 crore each) has to be acknowledged as a welcome move. Additionally, what is important is to acknowledge and protect the entire value chain (milk, meat, leather etc) of all livestock. It is important to ensure that the prevalent mood for protecting the cow does not come as a backlash for the small farmer. On bamboo:CSE has always been a strong proponent of using bamboo for building livelihood security, especially for the tribal poor - in the light of this, the government's proposal to restructure the National Bamboo Mission and promote the bamboo sector in a holistic manner is a positive step. On energy access:Air pollution resulting from biomass burning for cooking is a huge contributor to the disease burden of millions of Indian women, especially in rural and semi-urban sectors. In the light of this, it is imperative that poor households must be given access to clean and affordable energy for cooking. Mr Jaitley has announced an expansion of the Ujjwala scheme to benefit 80 million poor families, who will be given free cooking gas connections. CSE analysts point out that while this is another welcome intervention, refilling of cooking gas cylinders has been found to be rather lax compared to the scale at which free connections are being given - the scheme's overall implementation, hence, needs careful scrutiny and monitoring.

Fatty diet and air pollution among the biggest killer factors in state,"Pune: Dietary risks, high blood pressure, malnutrition and air pollution were the biggest factors that caused most deaths in Maharashtra and added to the state's disability burden in 2016.This was revealed in a recent estimate of the state-level disease burden and risk factors by the Indian Council for Medical Research, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation.Dietary risks, in fact, contributed to the biggest chunk (11.5%) of the state's disease burden in 2016, up from 6.3% in 1990. Dietary risks include the tendency towards eating fatty and high salt foods, among others. Though contribution of air pollution to the state's disease burden came down marginally from 9.8% in 1990 to 8.6% in 2016, researchers said the trend was not significant and pollution continued to be a major risk factor in Maharashtra. The report, based on the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), showed that factors such as dietary risks, high blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose and high total cholesterol contributed more to the disease burden in 2016 in comparison to what it was 26 years ago. DALYs is the sum of years of life lost due to an early death and years lived with a disability.In comparison to the scenario in 1990, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, iron-deficiency anaemia, self-harm and road injuries went up significantly in 2016 as the leading causes of death and diseases. /Lalit Dandona, lead author of the study and research professor at PHFI, said, ""Air pollution was the second leading risk factor in India as a whole. In case of Maharashtra, it is the fourth leading risk factor."" He added, ""This risk factor includes both outdoor air pollution from a variety of sources as well as household air pollution that results from burning solid fuels for cooking and heat. While household air pollution has dropped over time, outdoor air pollution has risen. Combined, they make a substantial contribution to the burden of cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases and lower respiratory infections."" Vehicular population is only one of the contributors of outdoor air pollution. Among other factors are coal burning, construction work and road dust.Dandona, who is also the director of India State-level Disease Burden Initiative, said dietary risks, which include diets low in fruit, vegetables and whole grain but high in salt and fat, were the state's leading risk factor in 2016. ""These risks drive health loss, mainly because of cardiovascular disease and diabetes,"" he said.Despite being a fairly developed state, Dandona said, malnutrition is still adding a lot to the state's disease burden.""The trend of consuming junk food has gone up exponentially in comparison to 1990s. Parents often go to work, leaving kids at day-care facilities. These children don't have access to proper nutrition. Many people now rely on quick bites instead of wholesome meals. The number of people suffering from diabetes, hypertension and high blood pressure coming to me for a diet plan has gone up significantly in recent years,"" said Mansi Sathe, a dietician in the city.The researchers arrived at the estimate on the basis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016.The data sources included censuses, vital registration, sample registration system and large-scale national household surveys such as national family health surveys, district level household surveys, annual health survey and surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Organization.

"Health schemes will go haywire if pollution isn't curbed, says Supreme Court","NEW DELHI: Days after the Centre announced an ambitious healthcare scheme to provide up to Rs 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation, the Supreme Court on Monday reminded the government that such programme would not be effective till pollution crisis is effectively tackled first.A bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta said that 13 out of 20 most polluted cities of the world were from India and pollution had become the ""most critical problem"". It said that a concerted effort from all concerned authorities was required to curb the menace which was not affecting the present generation but the coming generations would also have to pay the price. ""All your healthcare programme would go haywire if pollution is not controlled. People will keep falling sick because of pollution,"" the bench said.Advocate Aprajita Singh, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, told the bench that citizens' fundamental right to breathe fresh air could not be compromised at any costs. /She said that the governemnt needed to take a holistic approach towards the problem.""Today we are in a very critical state. Pollution is not confined to National Capital Region. It is across the country and situation is getting worse with each passing year. People are gasping and the government cannot take life of citizens lightly. The government is still at planning stage and it will take a long time to implement it,"" she contended while referring to the findings of various studies done on impact of pollution.As per the Global Burden of Disease estimates for 2017, early deaths related to PM 2.5 in India are the second highest in the world and ozone-related deaths, though lower than PM2.5, are the highest in the world. An epidemiological study done by Central Pollution Control Board and Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute of Kolkata showed that every third child has reduced lung function.

"Health schemes will go haywire if pollution isn't curbed, says Supreme Court","NEW DELHI: Days after the Centre announced an ambitious healthcare scheme to provide up to Rs 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation, the Supreme Court on Monday reminded the government that such programme would not be effective till pollution crisis is effectively tackled first.A bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta said that 13 out of 20 most polluted cities of the world were from India and pollution had become the ""most critical problem"". It said that a concerted effort from all concerned authorities was required to curb the menace which was not affecting the present generation but the coming generations would also have to pay the price. ""All your healthcare programme would go haywire if pollution is not controlled. People will keep falling sick because of pollution,"" the bench said.Advocate Aprajita Singh, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, told the bench that citizens' fundamental right to breathe fresh air could not be compromised at any costs. /She said that the governemnt needed to take a holistic approach towards the problem.""Today we are in a very critical state. Pollution is not confined to National Capital Region. It is across the country and situation is getting worse with each passing year. People are gasping and the government cannot take life of citizens lightly. The government is still at planning stage and it will take a long time to implement it,"" she contended while referring to the findings of various studies done on impact of pollution.As per the Global Burden of Disease estimates for 2017, early deaths related to PM 2.5 in India are the second highest in the world and ozone-related deaths, though lower than PM2.5, are the highest in the world. An epidemiological study done by Central Pollution Control Board and Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute of Kolkata showed that every third child has reduced lung function. The report said that sputum of children contains four times more iron-laden macrophages than those from cleaner environs, indicating pulmonary hemorrhage.As per the Greenpeace report, as many as 12 lakh deaths take place every year due to air pollution in India and says that the number of deaths caused by air pollution is only a ""fraction less"" than the number of deaths caused by tobacco usage.

NGT wants all brick kilns in NCR inspected,"Ghaziabad: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Wednesday issued notices to Union environment ministry and the governments of the states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi over illegal operation of brick kilns in these four states.The tribunal also directed the state pollution control board of each of the four states to inspect all brickfields mentioned in the petition and examine if they are complying with the environmental norms.The petitioner, Shailesh Singh, a Delhi-based environmentalist, has listed seven districts of Uttar Pradesh, including Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar, Baghpat, Meerut, Hapur and Muzaffarnagar, 13 districts of Haryana, including Gurgaon, and two districts (Alwar and Bharatpur) of Rajasthan, besides Delhi in the petition.""In the event of them being non-compliant, the state PCBs shall initiate appropriate action against them in accordance with law. Report of compliance shall be filed on the next date of hearing, March 6,"" the NGT order said.Singh alleged that brick kilns in these four states have been operating without complying with the pollution norms, causing immense air and water pollution and also without obtaining necessary clearances from the authorities concerned.Giving reference of a 2017 Central Pollution Control Board report, Singh said of 2,125 brick kilns in seven districts of Uttar Pradesh located in the National Capital Region, some 1,728 are operating illegally. Likewise, of 172 brick kilns in Alwar, 109 are running without permission, while in Bharatpur 13 of 110 do not have approval. /In Gurgaon, three of 11 are running without approval.""Smoke emitting from brick kilns not only affects the locals residing nearby but also has an adverse impact on workers who are employed there. They are often found working in despicable condition, and they are overexploited and there is no compliance of provisions of the law concerning women employees.""Moreover, brick kilns have been issued a direction to install zig-zag chimneys in order to reduce air pollution but the industries have completely failed to comply with such directions,"" he said.

Why Delhi kids have weaker lungs than EU's,"New Delhi: Even as the Centre claims that there is no direct link between diseases and air pollution, the Delhi-based Hazard Centre and some independent researchers have released a study highlighting how severe pollution levels at 15 locations along eight arterial roads and two Ring Roads are affecting lives.The study - released on Wednesday - also found that, on average, lung function among a majority of the over 300 children and young adults tested is far lower than the normal values for European children. The study was conducted with a network of low-cost air monitors between October and November 2017. It found that there is a base pollution load across Delhi of about 300\xB5g/m\xB3 for PM10 and 200\xB5g/m\xB3 for PM2.5, which is three times higher than the national standard. ""There was an overall spike in pollution levels to above 600\xB5g/m\xB3 for PM2.5 on November 8, and a smaller increase up to 500\xB5g/m\xB3 on November 12, and both were much higher than the one on Diwali on October 19,"" the study found. In fact, at Guru Tegh Bahadur Nagar on Ring Road, one of the low-cost monitors recorded a spike of 2,000\xB5g/m\xB3 in January 2018, but experts said that it could also be an anomaly.The locations monitored by the team included Holambi, Bhalswa, Wazirpur, Punjabi Bagh, GTB Nagar, Bahadurgarh, Seelampur, Seemapuri, Kalyanpuri, Patparganj, New Friends Colony, Tughlaqabad, Saket, Munirka and Ayanagar. /These locations were chosen because they were close to schools or colleges and there were Delhi Pollution Control Committee, IMD or Central Pollution Control Board monitors that could be used as reference. Experts said low-cost sensors estimate the pollution levels at the breathing height whereas high-volume air samplers of government agencies assess the pollution 5-6 metres above the ground. The low-cost devices yield data that are lower than the DPCC monitors, about the same as the IMD ones, and higher than the CPCB monitors. But the patterns are more or less the same, they found. The team also carried out a quick health study at 11 locations with 343 individuals below the age of 20 years who walk to school or college in the area. They found that 80% of the ""peak flow"" (how fast you can breathe out) values for children in Delhi fall below what is considered 'normal' for European children. ""This may partly be due to demographic differences, but one would not expect such a large difference in the city with the highest per capita income in the nation,"" a Hazard Centre expert said. Compared to those in west and east Delhi, those tested in the southern and northern peripheries had slightly better lung function results.The data analysis also revealed that, across Delhi, there is a spike in the morning hours between 8am and 10am, a dip in the afternoons between 2pm and 4pm, and another spike in the evening hours between 7pm and 9pm. The pollution loads are highest in places like Bahadurgarh and Punjabi Bagh in the west, GTB Nagar and Wazirpur in the north, Kalyanpuri in the east, and New Friends Colony in the south - all of them being characterised by heavy traffic on arterial roads. The air is relatively the cleanest in Holambi and Bhalswa in far north. Saket, Tughlakabad, and Ayanagar in south have slightly higher pollution but the peaks are comparatively lower.

Mumbai air quality shifts from poor to moderate in a day as sky clears up,"MUMBAI: Residents woke up to much better air quality and clear skies on Friday. Also, there was a further dip in minimum temperatures. On Friday, the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 175 which falls in the 'moderate' category as compared to 268 a day ago which is in the 'poor' category. The drop on Friday was significant as compared to the past few days when the city was enveloped in haze and visibility had reduced too.An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered moderate and may be a health concern for people sensitive to air pollution. On Friday morning, the minimum temperature recorded by the IMD Santa Cruz observatory was 16.7 degrees Celsius which was 0.5 degree Celsius below normal, while the Colaba observatory logged 20 degrees Celsius, which was 0.6 degree Celsius below normal. KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general (western region), IMD said the cloud cover had moved away. ""Besides, there was no wind movement at all owing to which dust particles remained suspended. This also ended up making visibility low. However, now with clear skies, temperatures have started to dip,"" said Hosalikar. Maximum temperatures also continued to hover around 30 degrees Celsius.

Notice to societies on genset pipes,"NOIDA: The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has issued notices to three housing societies in sectors 76 and 77 in Noida following complaints by residents that standards regarding the length of exhaust pipes of diesel generator sets used as power backups were not maintained.The residents of Prateek Wisteria and Civitech Sampriti in Sector 77 and Amrapali Princely Estate in Sector 76 had written to the UPPCB, city magistrate and the district magistrate, alleging that the length of the exhaust pipes of the DG sets was so short that smoke often reached the first two floors of the apartments. According to the complaints, the length of the pipes was as short as 1.5 metres in some cases, as against the prescribed length of 5 metres.""We had complained to the UPPCB, city magistrate and the district magistrate through an email on December 31, informing them that smoke from the DG set chimneys spreads across our society and reaches the first two floors. We cannot the doors and windows. /We had complained to our society manager but there was no response,"" said Amit Gupta, a resident of Prateek Wisteria.Gupta added that the residents of the neighbouring Civitech Sampriti and Amrapali Princely Estate had made similar complaints.PP Singh, a junior engineer in the district pollution control board who had visited the housing societies following the complaints, said he found the DG set exhaust pipes violating the standards.""I had visited Prateek Wisteria in Sector 77 on January 6 and found there were four DG sets of 625Kva capacity. None of them followed the prescribed norm of a 5 metre-long exhaust pipes. We have issued notices for corrective measures. Else, action will be taken under Section 31A of Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act, 1981,"" said Singh.SK Mittal, who heads the maintenance office at Prateek Wisteria, said: ""Our DG set chimneys are within the prescribed norms. We have sent a reply to the UPPCB notice."" The management of the other two societies could not be reached for comment. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Asia's biggest steel town gets PNG supply; Pollution levels to get reduced,"FATEHGARH SAHIB: With the help of Petroleum Department of India and IRM Energy Pvt. Ltd. the Piped Natural Gas (PNG) supply has been started as fuel to the industries in the Asia's biggest steel town Mandi Gobindgarh in Fatehgarh Sahib district today.The environmentalists claim that this will help to reduce the pollution levels not only in the town but in the entire district. The officials of the pollution department will now also encourage other industries as well as the automobiles to use PNG for the reduction of pollution.The first ever PNG supply has been given to M/s Chanakya Bakery Unit at Mandi Gobindgarh town on Thursday. /When counted on the scale of pollution the Mandi Gobindgarh town ranks second in the state after Punjab's industrial hub Ludhiana. In Mandi Gobindgarh there are more than 100 rolling industries, over 40 Hammers, besides 4G industry and others that all run on coal or other fuel to come up with their produce.The PPCB officials claim that if the entire industry of the town switch to PNG the pollution level will decrease upto 40 percent in the state. However, it does not seems as easier for the industry to switch to PNG immediately as the production cost of the produce is not cheaper than that of the coal or other fuel being used by the industry.""We have initiated the supply of PNG to the industry in the Mandi Gobindgarh town. This is just a beginning. We are communicating with the centre government also to boost the PNG suppliers so that it goes cheaper for the industry to adopt the PNG fuel instead of the coal or other fuels. The black smoke will reduce and thus the air quality. The gas supply will make the production of better quality than that of the coal and other fuels. The industrialist would also be saving the maintenance cost and losses that they face by using the coal"", said, PPCB Chief Environmental Engineer Karunesh Garg.The officials of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) however claim of making all their efforts to control the pollution by these industries in Punjab air quality. The officials now are planning to move to Ludhiana district of Punjab in encouraging the industry to switch to PNG fuel.IN past the efforts of PPCB had turned futile in curbing the air pollution following the burning of stubble by the farmers. Though it had registered cases against the farmers besides making appeals to them to not to burn the stubble. However, it failed to bring out the solution to stubble burning problem.""To save our coming generations from the ill effects of pollution it has become a dire need of the hour to curb the menace of rising pollution levels. The pollution is arising due to burning of coal and other fuels in the industry particularly at Asia's biggest steel town Mandi Gobindgarh. We initiated this supply in this town so that major pollution could be brought down"", said, PPCB Chairman Kahan Singh PannuHe said that the air pollution from transport vehicles especially auto rickshaws is causing damage to the environment and thereby causing extinct to many wild species. ""Three units are already using PNG as fuel in Mandi Gobindgarh supplied earlier by M/s GAIL India. Now, the project for the supply of gas in Fatehgarh Sahib district has been awarded to M/s IRM Energy Pvt. Ltd., which has started its City Gas Station at Focal Point, Mandi Gobindgarh. The project of supplying PNG to other industries is in process and it will be started soon. Besides this, CNG will also be made available for use in automobiles. The directions to the officials of PPCB have been given to create awareness among industrialists in this regard,"" added, PPCB Chairman KS Pannu. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Indoor air pollution 10 times more harmful, say experts","Chennai: Indoor air pollution (IAP) is ten times more harmful than outdoor air pollution but more attention is given to the latter, participants from leading technology and research institutions said while discussing indoor air quality management in tropical climatic conditions on Friday.""Toxins remain trapped inside an enclosed room, depending on the ventilation, which make it worse. Factors causing IAP lead to release and accumulation of pollutants like formaldehyde, radon, asbestos, heavy metals, tobacco smoke, and those released by burning of cooking fuel and biomass,"" said Dr Chitra of Madras Medical College.She said even though LPG causes lower pollution than the burning of biomass it is not safe. ""It is slightly better. /Also, IAP depends not only on what is being burnt but also the way cooking is done,"" she added.The summit on air quality management saw the participation of scientists and leading professionals from IIT Madras, State and Central Pollution Control Board, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute and private companies in the technology sector. Issues affecting air quality in urban and rural settings were discussed.""The problem in urban settings is the dearth of open spaces. Another problem is the shortage of green cover which, to a large extent, reduces the toxins in the air,"" said Dr R Sivacoumar, principal scientist at CSIR-NEERI.He emphasised that while choosing residential spaces, one must ensure that the floor space index (FSI) is not more than 1.5. ""If FSI is more than 1.5, it shows a decrease in the open space,"" he added.Discussing the impact of air quality on the mental and physical health of humans, the panel focused on the design, development and cost of air quality monitoring systems, air quality problems in micro indoor and outdoor environment, and the impact of day-to-day household items in creating poor air quality.
