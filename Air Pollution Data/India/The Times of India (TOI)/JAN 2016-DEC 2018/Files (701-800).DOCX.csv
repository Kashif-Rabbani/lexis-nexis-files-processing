"In revival mode, harmonica hits the high notes, offers pulmonary relief too","While most musical instruments require time and effort to learn, the rudimentary harmonica (mouth organ) is an easy pick-me-up plaything that relies moderately on lung power. Bits of the harmonica sound were a common feature in Bollywood songs of old - remember Dev Anand in 'Hai apna dil to awara' (Solva Saal) and Dharmendra in 'Yeh dosti...' (Sholay). Then the disco era dawned, electronic sound followed and the harmonica was forgotten.City-based Nandu Belvalkar, who picked up the harmonica when barely 8, felt that the instrument deserved revival. In 2007, he started India's first harmonica club in Pune and the response was heartening. Today, most major cities across the country and even places in Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan have styled harmonica clubs on the Pune chapter.Belvalkar, now 73, strives to not just make the harmonica popular but trains one to play in a structured manner. /People played instinctively in the days of old, minus the grammar or organised training, he points out.With time on his hands after retirement, Belvalkar began conducting harmonica programmes in city auditoriums from 2000. In February this year, he organised Mumbai's first-ever full-fledged harmonica show which drew an audience of 300. And, on Narak Chaturdashi each year, his group plays at the city's old age home, Niwara.The fare on offer during these programmes is purely Bollywood songs. No blues, folk or jazz sounds here, which artistes like Bob Dylan and Stevie Wonder produced on their harmonicas. ""Blues and the like are popular abroad, not here. Personally, I find blues to be unrecognisable music. You hear blues and recollect nothing about it an hour later,"" he says wryly.Affinities for musical genres aside, the harmonica provides a medical remedy too. One of Belvalkar's students, Mandar Gadre (52), had developed a black patch on his lung after inhaling cement dust while working at a construction site seven years ago. The civil engineer, who cycles around 25km every morning, found his pedal power grudgingly taking him up to only 4km.Belvalkar had the solution: a pulmonary harmonica or pulmonica, which has frequencies that are different from the regular instrument. Gadre has been playing the pulmonica for the past six months, for 10 minutes first thing in the morning, and is back on track with his morning workout.Belvalkar explains that the pulmonica is a medically-authenticated instrument in the West for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cases. Devised by a Canadian doctor, notes played on it induce vibrations that increase the elasticity of the diaphragm, break the viscosity of fluids in the chest and help clear them. The instrument does not have a scale as such; it has chords. The pulmonicas used for chronic COPD cases have a partition in between the holes to allow for higher- and lower-pitched notes. The harmonica is all about judgment and feel, says Deepak Vaidya (63), who teaches the instrument as well as keyboards at Dhayari. He says it is easier to learn the keyboards as one can see the keys, unlike the harmonica. He has a collection of 12 harmonicas, the costliest being a Sydel-make at Rs 25,000. Sydel, along with Hohner and Suzuki, are the top three harmonica makers in the world, while cheaper Chinese versions are available a dime a dozen. Vaidya says there are basically two types of harmonicas - diatonic and chromatic. The chromatic instrument has a slider to offer more notes - a 12-hole harmonica will give you 48 notes using the slider. The chromatic harmonica, which doesn't have a slider, is best for Bollywood songs, he says.Madan Kumar Sharma (76), who came to Pune as a four-year-old during Partition, has been playing the harmonica for as long as he can remember. In his vast collection of harmonicas, his favourite one is the top-of-the-line Hohner silver concerto chromatic which he bought in Spain in 1974. This particular instrument costs around Rs 5 lakh today.In his early days, Sharma worked as a building supervisor but, on the side, would provide sound systems to orchestras and even drama shows like the popular 'Teen Paishacha Tamasha'. He cut the first extended play (EP) record of his harmonica renditions in 1968 before going on to cut one super long playing (LP) record, 9 CDs and 8 audio-cassettes. His harmonica recordings have been played on All India Radio and Radio Ceylon (now Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation).The blow-draw concept of the harmonica is stimulant for the lungs, says Belvalkar. He believes the pulmonica will catch momentum quickly because of the prevailing air pollution. ""Pollution causes the lungs and diaphragm to lose elasticity. Haemoglobin formation reduces and immunity, oxygen and energy levels in the body drop. Playing the harmonica is like doing pranayam. It is the only instrument in the world which plays both ways - breathing in and out. Baba Ramdev gives you kapalbhati while the harmonica gives you musical kapalbhati,"" he says.

Marathi short film 'Astu' draws focus on dementia,"Nagpur: The Indian Academy of Neurology, Nagpur Neuro Society and Psychiatric Society Nagpur brought the focus on brain diseases by screening a film Astu on World Brain Day. Actor Mohan Agashe who is part of the film as the protagonist was also present at the Persistant System Ltd. auditorium to discuss the film after the screening.Written and directed by Sumitra Bhave, the film which was made in 2013 focuses on issues faced by those suffering from Alzheimer's disease or dementia and the difficulties that their care givers face. /As the diseases sets in during old age, the film delivers its message through the sufferings of appa, or Prof. Chakarapani Shastri, a Sanskrit professor played by Agashe. The film deals with the condition of appa, how his own family struggles to look after him and how he gets selfless love and care from the poor family of a mahout, whom he has followed through the city in his eagerness to get an elephant ride.Bhave, who has made a couple of films dealing with health issues like Zindagi Zindabad, Nital and Kasaav, brings out the undercurrents and dilemmas of the family with finesse. The contrast between the family's attitude towards appa and the innocent love that the poor family, especially the mahout's wife shows for him underlines not just the problems but their solutions too felt Agashe. In conversation with psychiatrist Dr. Sudhir Bhave, Agashe drew attention to the large population of senior citizens in the society today. ""The doctors are giving them a long life but the quality is deteriorating day by day,"" he said. Advocating more sensitivity towards the aged and ailing, Aghashe said, ""Having a person suffering with dementia is not a big problem if the family's attitude is positive. As a man grows old he faces too many memories and dementia is just one way of shutting them out. It is also a condition where the lines of differentiation blur,"" he said.Ahead of the screening, Dr. Chandrashekhar Meshram dwelled upon the theme of this year's Brain Day which was 'Air Pollution and Brain Health'. ""More than 18 lakh persons die in India due to pollution related diseases every year, which is nearly 27% of all deaths and is more than TB, Malaria and AIDS,"" Meshram said.Advocating widespread use of solar energy, Dr. Meshram said, ""We still use solid fuel in kitchens, power plants and industries. India stands first among air pollution deaths. We need to run a swach vayu abhiyan on the lines of Swach Bharat Abhiyan to tackle it,"" he added.Dr. Meshram also announced the dates of the 3rd Orange City International Film Festival which will be held on Feb 7-9, 2019. ""The Orange City Cultural Foundation will also hold a two day festival of films made by Jabbar Patel on Sept 8 and 9,"" informed Meshram who is the chairman of the foundation.

"Map city drains, HC tells corporations","New Delhi: Delhi high court on Thursday directed the three corporations and other civic agencies managing stormwater drains in the city to start mapping them indicating the geographical areas they serve.HC said there should be a unified map on which all agencies could work so that blocked or overflowing stormwater drains are cleared to prevent waterlogging.A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar asked for a 'consolidated' map after it was told by Delhi Jal Board (DJB) that different agencies were responsible for each of the drains.The court said it does not want several plans from each of the agencies, and instead, called for a single 'composite plan'.

Meanwhile, the Delhi government told HC that the drains have not being designed to handle the amount of rainfall, especially under the Minto Road Bridge, in the capital recently.The bench, however, did not accept the argument and said since waterlogging was a repetitive phenomenon, the government should have made efforts to increase the capacity of the drains. /To this the government told the court that it has installed water pumps in several areas to address the issues.Taking suo motu cognisance of the news reports earlier this month, the bench had asked the Delhi government and the civic agencies why waterlogging was a recurring problem every time it rained and sought to know the steps taken to prevent it.

HC: Emergency efforts needed to clear drains,"New Delhi: Emergency efforts are needed to ensure drains remain free of obstructions to stop rainwater and sewage from stagnating on roads, Delhi high court noted on Monday.Backing a complete overhaul of the drainage system to tackle waterlogging woes, the court stressed on the need for all agencies to work in tandem and make sure there is an action plan in this regard.A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar said sewage and stormwater have to be promptly dealt with and directed authorities concerned to draw up an action plan. It also appointed a panel headed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) chief executive officer (CEO) to examine and help remove difficulties in drainage of stormwater and sewage.The bench set up the committee after taking note of news reports that claimed the drainage system in the city was archaic and needed upgradation. The court said given the multiplicity of authorities and their 'inability to undertake the minimalistic task' of ensuring proper drainage, it was 'essential' to monitor the same so that woes of residents are addressed.The bench on July 26 had asked the municipal and other civic bodies to map all such drains indicating the geographical areas they service. /The court had taken suo motu cognisance of the news reports about waterlogging after heavy rainfall between July 10 and July 13. It had asked the Delhi government and the civic agencies why waterlogging remains a recurring problem and sought to know the steps taken to prevent it. The court had also said the fallout of waterlogging was not only loss of man hours, but the idling engines of vehicles add to air pollution as well. The flooded roads and pavements also lead to spread of water-borne and vector-borne diseases, it added, while directing the chief secretary to convene a meeting and file a report within 10 days.It had also sought a response from Public Works Department (PWD) and AAP government.

Study points to pollution role in lung cancer,"New Delhi: Lung cancer is no longer restricted only to smokers as many non-smokers, including young men and women, are also falling prey to it, a study stated.The study, which conducted over the past six years by doctors at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SRGH), involved analysing 150 in-house patients suffering from lung cancer from March 2012 to June 2018.Dr Arvind Kumar, chairman, centre for chest surgery at SGRH, said nearly 50% of these patients were non-smokers. ""The percentage of non-smokers detected with lung cancer was 70% in the younger age group (less than 50 years). Five patients, all men, were in the age group of 20-30 years and none of them were smokers,"" he added.While conventional wisdom states that smoking is its main cause, but now, there is strong evidence that points to the increasing role of air pollution in the rise of the cases.Of the 150 patients included in the study, 119 were men and 31 women, with nearly half of the women from different parts of the country, mostly north India.Dr Neeraj Jain, chairman, pulmonology department, SGRH, said, ""There are multiple factors at play - smoking, passive smoking, pollution - causing the disease. /There is a need for action to prevent lung cancer deaths by early detection, smoking cessation and strong measures to control both outdoor and indoor air pollution.""

Spike in chronic cough cases among kids due to air pollution: Study,"Bengaluru: A recent study by a senior pulmonologist has revealed that the city's air pollution is resulting in rising incidence of chronic cough among children.Dr H Paramesh, a senior paediatric pulmonologist, has found that air pollution was to blame for 21% of the chronic cough cases in children below 18 years in 2017-end, up from 8% in 1999. The over 160% increase in the incidence was arrived at after analysing children's cases in Bengaluru hospitals over nearly two decades. A cough that persists for two weeks or more is known as chronic cough in the Indian context. The study says rising levels of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in the air is the reason for chronic cough, and students who are stuck in traffic while commuting to school end up becoming the victims. Dr Paramesh revealed this on the sidelines of the first meeting of C-40 City Air Quality Network, a global effort to tackle air pollution in urban areas across the world. /His research paper titled 'Air Pollution and Allergic Airway Diseases: Social Determinants and Sustainability in Control and Prevention' was published in the April issue of Indian Journal of Pediatrics and in an American Medical Journal as well. ""Chronic cough cases among children have multiple side-effects as they lose sleep and aren't able to focus on studies. It has also been observed that more than 40% of parents in such cases refer to at least five medical consultants/doctors as they fail to find relief for their kids,"" he explained.The study points out that the impact of air pollution among children is spread across the social strata, though the number of victims from the economically weaker section, like those from slums, is more. The expert arrived at the findings after analysing children's cases in Bengaluru hospitals over the years. Dr Paramesh, who has conducted studies on other effects of air pollution on human health and published several medical papers, said even adults are not spared of the ill-effects. ""While asthma and other respiratory problems are already common, we are increasingly finding air pollution being the cause of heart ailments, dementia and diabetes as well,"" he said.""We need clean air policies with standard norms and have to overcome challenges such as rapid urbanisation, lack of multi-sectoral policy-making and lack of finance for research and development,"" he added.3k children affected per yr *Study says over 3,000 children suffer from chronic cough a year in the city*This is causing major psycho-socio-economic health burden to the country* Air pollution due to slow-moving traffic is among the major causes of increased prevalence of allergic airway diseases among children* Kids who spend time on the road negotiating heavy traffic while commuting to school suffer more * Such respiratory problems are common in kids from lower socio-economic background* Urban children hit more than their rural counterparts * Other associated clinical features present with chronic cough are snoring (42.4%), breathing through mouth (43.4%), conjunctivitis (27.3%), bruxism or involuntary grinding of teeth (16.9%) and sleep-disordered breathing (27.3%)Source: Study by Dr Paramesh, senior paediatric pulmonologistWHAT AILS B'LURU: CAUSES OF POLLUTION42%: Vehicular emissions20%: Road dust14%: Construction activities14%: Industrial emissions7%: Diesel generator sets3%: Domestic emissions and othersSource: Karnataka State Pollution Control Board For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
2 compost plants to come up near Vishnupad temple,"GAYA: To make productive use of the municipal waste generated in the Vishnupad temple area, two plants for manufacturing vermi compost are being set up. Each plant will have the capacity to use 500 kg of perishable municipal waste and convert it into compost. ""Though 'pindadaan' rituals are conducted throughout the area, many prefer the fortnightlong Pitrapaksh Mela period concluding just before the installation of the Durga Puja kalash,"" says Arun Kumar Prasad, an expert of religious philosophy.The pilgrims visiting Vishnupad temple for the performance of pindadaan rituals offer rice balls for salvation of ancestral souls. /Other grains and perishable items too are used. Such items are strewn here and there causing health hazard. The items would be productively used once the compost plants are installed.According to district magistrate Abhishekh Singh, ""Gaya Municipal Corporation will manage the compost plants. Funding for installation of the compost plants will be done by the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL). The corporation has provided Rs five crore for the development of civic amenities in the Vishnupad area. Besides the two compost plants, the fund provided by the IOC under the 'Iconic City Development Plan' would also be used for purchase of two sweeping machines and 50 decorated dust bins.""The DM also said that water ATMs too would be installed in the temple area for the benefit of pilgrims and other visitors. About the proposal to install an electric crematorium near the Vishnupad temple, the DM said that any such proposal has not come before him for consideration. Efforts will be made to reduce the impact of air pollution at the Vishnupad burning ghat, he said. No charge will be levied for drinking water supplied through the water ATMs. ""Regular quality test of the water and servicing of the water ATMs as per the operation protocol of the system would be ensured,"" said Singh.""On the point of black listing of the vulnerable private buildings in the Vishnupad area on account of such buildings not being safe to accommodate pilgrims,"" the DM said that officials associated with the housing of the pilgrims have been directed to inspect the private houses before granting lodging licences during the forthcoming Pitrapaksha Mela. Government school buildings too would be requisitioned for housing the pilgrims.There was a proposal to construct a 10,000 capacity multi-storeyed dharamshala by relocating the Infectious Diseases Hospital. The ID hospital is located on a 3.5 acre plot near the Vishnupad temple. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Trees are our shield against pollutants,"Ahmedabad: What can cities do to guard themselves from harmful gases and smoke billowing out of factory exhausts. Today, each of the four major Gujarat cities - Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot - are surrounded by harmful chemical industrial clusters and burning waste mounds that smoke our air with carcinogens.A team of researchers from environmental science department of the Institute of Science and Technology for Advanced Studies and Research (ISTAR), Vallabh Vidyanagar and local bodies found that trees such as banyan, peepal, ashok and champak proved to be effective in controlling pollution. But in the process, these benign species take the maximum blow after absorbing the pollutants. /The study found that when these trees were planted in areas with higher level of pollutants, they had lower chlorophyll content as certain pollutants diminish the total chlorophyll content.The ISTAR researchers had measured factors such as high values of Air Pollution Tolerance Index (APTI) and the Anticipated Performance Index (API) of different tree species that were key determinants of minimising the threat of pollutants from industrial areas. The study was mostly carried out in a 3km radius from Nandesari industrial area which had good greenery and lesser nearby air pollutants. For collection of gaseous and particulate pollution, High Volume Air Sampler was used for 24 hours with flow rate of one litre per minute.ISTAR researchers Dhruti Patel and Nirmal Kumar calculated scientific parameters such as total chlorophyll, ascorbic acid, leaf pH, relative water content and used them for defining sensitivity or resistance of plants towards different air pollutant concentration. ""Plant sensitivity and tolerance to air pollutants varied with above parameters. Chlorophyll content decreased due to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the chloroplast underwater stress condition,"" claimed the research. The study also observed that changes in chlorophyll content caused change in the rate of photo-synthesis as well.In the plant, higher ascorbic acid concentration of leaves lead to an effective strategy to protect thylakoid membranes from oxidative damage under water stress conditions. ""Alkaline particles such as limestone and dust particle in air usually damaged plant surfaces while high pH improved tolerance against air pollution,"" observed the research.

"Dump garbage in front of Delhi LG House, not in residential colony: SC to govt","NEW DELHI: Irked over the proposal to build a landfill site in a residential colony of Sonia Vihar without taking local residents into confidence, the Supreme Court on Monday asked the Delhi government why the garbage should not be dumped in front of Lieutenant Governor's official residence instead of harassing common people of the colony.A bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta said that piling of unprocessed garbage on Delhi's roads had become alarming, but the government was not taking swift action to deal with the problem. The court referred to a recent study conducted by Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) which came to the conclusion that air pollution, not smoking, is a major factor for lung cancer in India.""Will there be any person alive in Delhi in such a situation? It is an emergency situation but your reaction does not reflect the emergency,"" the bench told additional solicitor general (ASG) Pinky Anand who was appearing for Delhi government.The ASG contended that government had prepared a plan to deal with the problem but it could not be resolved overnight and it would take time. /She said that decision on setting up new waste-to-energy plants by south and north Delhi municipal corporations (SDMC an NDMC) had been taken also for enhancement of all existing plants to increase the processing of garbage. She said that new units would start operationing from December next year. She also informed the court that a new landfill site was to be set up in Sonia Vihar but it was being delayed due to opposition from the residents.The court then asked the ASG why the government had not consulted the local residents and allayed their apprehension before taking the decision as the garbage could not dumped in front of their houses. ""You are taking the stand of 1975 (Emergency era) when people's opinion were not sought. Why do not you dump the garbage in front of Raj Niwas. You cannot treat people like this. I do not know what kind of colony is Sonia Vihar but I can say that people residing there must not belong to well-to-do families and that is why you have selected the site. Life of people gets affected if garbage is dumped in front of their houses. It is not acceptable,"" the bench said.The court noted that only 50 per cent of 3,600 tonnes garbage generated everyday in south Delhi is processed and 1,800 tonnes was thrown at the landfill site on daily basis. It asked the government to file plans on management of solid waste and on segregation of garbage of household level. The court said that people should be punished for not segregating recyclables waste from solid waste and penalty should be imposed on them. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"17L respiratory infections, 981 deaths in 5 yrs in capital","New Delhi: The capital witnessed 981 deaths due to Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) from 2013 to 2017. Over 17 lakh others were diagnosed with ARI, stated a standing committee report tabled in Parliament on Tuesday.The report said the polluted air in Delhi-NCR is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases and health conditions, including respiratory infections, and recommended immediate corrective and preventive strategic steps in consultation to mitigate the air pollution.The committee, which held three meetings with authorities concerned and analysed the whole gamut of air pollution in Delhi-NCR in the past nine months, said it was surprised to note that the health ministry was not taken on board in the high-level task force on air pollution which is, in a way, indicative of ignorance as well as denial about negative impact of air pollution on human health. ""The committee recommends that considering the severe health hazards of air pollution, ministry of environment, forest and climate change should take immediate corrective and preventive strategic steps in consultation with the health ministry,"" the committee advised.It has asked the health ministry to aggressively start an awareness campaign to educate people about the adverse health effects of air pollution, and the ways and means to minimise its adverse impacts.In 2016, the World Health Organisation (WHO) put Delhi amongst the 20 most polluted cities in the world in terms of PM2.5 levels.An epidemiological study conducted in 2008 on effects of air pollution on human health (adults) in Delhi, referred to by the parliamentary committee in its report, shows citizens of the city were more susceptible to respiratory symptoms compared with those living in rural areas.The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) had said last year there is growing body of scientific research that shows that air pollution can permanently damage a child's brain.UNICEF also said that south Asia has the largest proportion of babies living in areas where air pollution is at least six times higher than international limits (10 micrograms per cubic metre). ""Pollution is one of the biggest health hazards of our times. /Apart from the government agencies, people need to realise this urgently too and take preventive measures,"" Dr Arvind Kumar, centre for chest surgery at SGRH, said.In a recent analysis conducted by him that involved 150 in-house patients suffering from lung cancer from March 2012 to June 2018, Dr Kumar found nearly half of the patients were non-smokers. While conventional wisdom states that smoking is its main cause, but now, there is strong evidence that points to the increasing role of air pollution in the rise of the cases, he said.Calling polluted air in Delhi a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases and health conditions, the parliamentary committee on Tuesday said infants, children and asthmatic patients were most vulnerable to it.

"Every month, hosp admits 150 young heart attack patients","Bengaluru: Is 16 the new 40 when it comes to heart attacks? It appears so going by the patients' registry at Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, the biggest cardiac care hospital in Asia Pacific. Cardiologists at the government-run hospital are shocked and puzzled in equal measure after noticing a steady stream of young patients - those in the 16 to 40 years age group - being admitted with heart attacks. Doctors say they admit about 150 young patients - about eight of whom are below 25 years - every month. /This translates to a minimum three to four cases every day. .Under a project, Premature Coronary Artery Disease (PCAD), the hospital analyzed cases of youngsters (16-40 years age group), presenting themselves with symptoms of heart attack. The hospital had admitted 1,864 youngsters since April 2017. In fact, six youngsters were admitted at the hospital on Friday alone.The youngest patient treated at the hospital recently was a 16-year-old from Andhra Pradesh, who resides in a city hostel. The I PUC student had a heart attack, and initially mistook the symptoms for a gastric problem.""Most of these patients ignore the warning signs,"" said Dr Rahul S Patil, cardiologist, principal investigator of the PCAD clinic. ""They mistake heartburn for a gastric problem, but as their condition worsens with excruciating pain, they understand that it is not just that.""When TOI visited the hospital on Friday, a 19-year-old from Mandya was being treated for a heart attack in the ICU. The teen, who recently moved out of Bengaluru after his father's death early this year, admitted that he was an alcoholic and a smoking addict and this may have aggravated his health.But doctors say the Mandya teenager is an exception. ""We found that most patients below 40 years do not fall into any vulnerable conditions like cholesterol, diabetes, obesity or smoking that trigger heart attack,"" said Rahul. Doctors say lifestyle changes, diet, air pollution, stress and genes could be the contributing factors. While most cases are from Bengaluru (45%), the rest were referred by hospitals in other districts.""Incidentally, 25% of the patients are cab drivers,"" said Rahul. ""The rest are mostly professionals who travel for more than an hour every day amidst city's traffic and pollution.""\xC4ccording to Dr C N Manjunath, director of the institute, everyone in Bengaluru is smoking. ""We might not be smoking cigarettes, but we are all inhaling polluted air, which has its impact on our health,"" Manjunath said. ""Today's youngsters are over ambitious and have unrealistic goals, which is only adds to stress. Nuclear families where young couples lack social support system also triggers stress. These non-measurable risk factors have tremendous impact on the younger generation.""Manjunath recalled the case of an engineer in his early 20s who was preparing for the UPSC exam who suffered a heart attack and was treated at Jayadeva three months ago.The data also shows that an overwhelming majority (92 per cent) of youngsters suffering a heart attack are men. ""Young women are protected by reproductive hormones and have a natural barrier to heart attacks,"" Rahul said. ""But of late we are seeing women who are facing early menopause and hormonal imbalance leading to cardiac complications.""He was on steroidsA 31-year-old from Bagaluru suffered a heart attack earlier this week and was rushed to a hospital close to his house. His condition was stabilized and later shifted him to Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research where it was found that he had blocks in three arteries.

Babies in prams at risk of 60% more pollution than their parents: Study,"HYDERABAD: In a cause for concern, a team of Indian researchers has found that babies in prams can be exposed to up to 60 per cent more pollution than their parents, causing potential damage to their frontal lobes, impacting on their cognitive abilities and brain development.Frontal lobe is the part of the brain that controls cognitive skills. Since babies in prams are at a lower level (nearer to the ground) than the adults, who carry them, they are more exposed to pollutants. Concentration of pollutants, particularly automobile exhaust fumes, is high at the ground level. /City doctors said the exposure of babies to dangerous pollutants is more at road crossings and traffic signals.Indian scientists at the Global Centre for Clean Air Research (GCARE) at the University of Surrey, UK, studied over 160 references to arrive at the conclusion that babies in prams are more prone to pollution than adults. The study, published in the latest issue of the Environment International journal, highlighted various factors about pollution exposure of babies in prams and suggested mitigation strategies. India-born senior scientist Prof Prashanth Kumar heads the GCARE.The researchers team investigated different types of prams based on their height, width, and whether they seat one child or two to assess if this impacted on pollution exposure levels. They found that infants in prams breathe in more polluted air since they are positioned between 0.55 metres and 0.85 metres above ground level and vehicle exhaust pipes usually sit within one metre above road level. This increases the vulnerability of babies in prams to being exposed to more pollution than adults.""Many studies done in India for the last one decade to see the effects of vehicular pollution on schoolchildren mostly in the 3-10 years age group. They showed detrimental effects on lungs and leading to rise in paediatric asthma, bronchitis and upper airway diseases etc,"" said Dr S Mallikarjun Rao, senior consultant pulmonologist, Apollo Hospitals.Prof Prashant Kumar said, ""We know infants breathe in higher amounts of airborne particles relative to their lung size and body weight compared to adults. What we have proven here is that the height most children travel at while in a pram doubles the likelihood of negative impacts from air pollution when compared to an adult.""

Wildlife enthusiasts to protest against toll plaza on hanging bridge in Kota,"Jaipur: Wildlife lovers in Kota are gearing up for a protest against the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), for constructing a toll plaza on the recently inaugurated hanging bridge, which runs through the National Chambal Gharial Sanctuary and the periphery of the Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR). Allegedly, NHAI has constructed the plaza without obtaining a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the forest department and Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB), for establishing a toll plaza in close proximity to the wildlife sanctuary. Moreover, the constant noise and smoke emitted from the generator set there, is disturbing the wildlife. A wildlife enthusiast and conservationist, Sudhir Gupta said, ""It's a violation of rules, as no construction can take place within the 1-km area of sanctuary. /The toll is situated on a bridge, which passes through a sanctuary. This would not only disturb the wildlife, but would also increase noise and air pollution."" At the time when the NHAI constructed this stretch of east-west corridor, it was informed, that it took permission from the ministry of environment. Tapeshwar Singh Bhati, president of the Mukundra Hills Environment and Wildlife Society, Kota, said, ""The bridge runs through a vast area of MHTR, there is a corridor which is frequented by sloth bears, leopards and other animals. The increased movements of trucks, and other vehicles creates a din, which affects animals.""Acting on the complaint of the environmentalist, the RSPCB had also issued notice to NHAI for causing air and noise pollution. The RSPCB has also asked NHAI to submit the NOC, if any. The 1.4-km-long, six-lane hanging bridge in Kota is claimed to be the longest hanging bridge in the country. The hanging bridge facilitates an uninterrupted, swift traffic flow of vehicles, from Porbandar in Gujarat to Silchar in Assam. ""As the Alligator Sanctuary falls under a part of the hanging bridge in the Chambal River, 700 meters of the bridge has been suspended with cables, instead of pillars, naming it the 'hanging bridge'. After the toll plaza was constructed, the pollution in the area has increased manifold, as heavy vehicles have to stop at the toll,"" said another environmentalist.

China pollution study rings alarm for India,"MUMBAI: A joint study conducted by Yale and Peking Universities on long-term exposure to air pollution on 32,000 Chinese has been published in the Proceedings of National Academy of Science (PNAS) journal. The Chinese study's findings could hold true for India, where roughly 25 lakh people died in 2015 due to causes arising out of air pollution. Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner, Greenpeace India, said the impact of air pollution in China is comparable to India. /""The trajectory of development for both China and India are similar and hence are the levels and sources of pollution. So, even if the magnitude of impact might vary for the countries, there could be a similar impact on health,"" said Dahiya. Dr Sundeep Salvi of the Pune-based Chest Research Foundation said he isn't surprised that air pollution affects cognitive skills. ""An American study last year showed a correlation between the brain size of elderly women and the levels of pollution in their areas. More the pollution, higher and faster is the shrinkage of the brain,"" he added.Mumbai-based pulmonologist Sanjay Mehta said cognitive damage due to air pollution has been suspected for long. ""What is really worrying is air pollution's long-term damages such as cancer. Lungs of children exposed to pollution become shrunken and damaged, with these children suffering from diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or asthma early on,"" he said.Salvi added that the younger people aren't unaffected by air pollution levels. ""Air pollution could be the reason for their aggression or hyperactive behaviour,"" he added.The new Yale study seeks to highlight the indirect effect of pollution on social welfare. ""The damage air pollution has on ageing brains likely imposes substantial health and economic cost, considering that cognitive functioning is critical for the elderly to both running daily errands and making high-stakes economic decisions,"" said Zhang. ""India must apply the precautionary principle which means, however uncertain the risk is, we must work towards reducing the air pollution,"" added Dahiya of Greenpeace India.

"'Exposure to air pollution leads to lower verbal, maths scores'","Recent studies have shown that air pollution is bad for health. But how bad is it? A four-year longitudinal study by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has, for the first time, found that exposure to air pollution over a significant period of time impacts cognitive abilities, and leads to steep reduction in verbal and math tests scores. /""Long-term exposure to air pollution impedes cognitive performance in verbal and math tests,"" said study author Xiaobo Zhang, senior research fellow, IFPRI and distinguished chair professor of economics at Peking University. ""The damage on cognitive ability by air pollution also likely impedes the development of human capital. Therefore, a narrow focus on the negative effect on health may underestimate the total cost of air pollution. Our findings on the damaging effect of air pollution on cognition imply that the indirect effect of pollution on social welfare could be much larger than previously thought,"" Zhang added.While the health consequences of air pollution are well known, few studies have examined its impact on cognitive abilities. The study, ""The impact of exposure to air pollution on cognitive performance"", co-authored by IFPRI's Xiaobo Zhang, Xin Zhang of Beijing Normal University, and Xi Chen of Yale University, has been published in health journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).The study, with a sample size of nearly 32,000, examined the relationship between cognitive test scores, taken from the nationally representative China Family Panel Studies longitudinal survey conducted in 2010 and 2014, with short- and long-term air pollution exposure calculated from official air pollution index values. Zhang observed that the impact for India could be much worse as pollution levels are higher in New Delhi than Beijing.Both verbal and math scores decreased with increasing cumulative air pollution exposure, with a steeper decline for verbal scores than math scores, according to the key findings of the study. The decline in verbal scores was more pronounced among males (49% more) than females. Among males, the decline in verbal scores became more pronounced with age, and this age dependence was greater in those with less than a middle school education compared with a middle school education or more.""The damage air pollution has on aging brains likely imposes substantial health and economic cost, considering that cognitive functioning is critical for the elderly to both running daily errands and making high-stakes economic decisions. This finding has been neglected in the policy discourse, and has important policy implications,"" said Zhang. Cognitive decline or impairment are risk factors of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia for the elderly.""These research findings on China, the largest developing country with severe air pollution, also shed light on other developing countries,"" said Zhang. World's top 20 most polluted cities, according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) database, are in developing countries. Almost all the cities in low- and middle-income countries with more than 1,00,000 residents fail to meet WHO air quality guidelines. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air pollution affects brain too, hits math skills, says study","Air pollution not only harms the heart and lungs, a new study indicates it affects the brain so much that people, especially the elderly, could struggle for words or complete simple math sums.Long-term exposure to air pollution, in other words, severely affects cognition skills, according to the study jointly done by Yale and Peking Universities and published in the reputed Proceedings of National Academy of Science (PNAS) journal.""The PNAS study found significant reduction in verbal and math skills of people exposed to air pollution over a long duration of time,'' said a release sent by Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute that conducted the study along with Yale and Peking universities. ""The effect was more pronounced among men than women--and worst among the elderly,"" it added.Nearly 32,000 Chinese were surveyed between 2010 and 2014 and their short- and long-term exposure to air pollution was calculated. One of the main authors, Xiaobo Zhang , said the decline was steeper for verbal scores than math scores. /Among males, the decline in verbal scores became more pronounced with age, and was greater in those who were less educated.The Chinese study's findings could hold true for India as well where roughly 25 lakh people died in 2015 due to causes arising out of air pollution. Sunil Dahiya, Senior Campaigner, Greenpeace India said the impact of air pollution in China are comparable to India. ""The trajectory of development for both China and India are similar and hence are the levels and sources of pollution. So, even if the magnitude of impact might vary for both countries, there could be a similar impact on health,"" said Dahiya.Dr Sundeep Salvi of Punebased Chest Research Foundation said he isn't surprised that air pollution affects cognitive skills. ""An American study last year that showed a correlation between the brain size of elderly women and the levels of pollution in their areas. More the pollution, higher and faster is the shrinkage of the brain,"" he added.Mumbai-based pulmonologist Sanjay Mehta said that cognitive damage due to air pollution has been suspected for long. ""What is really worrying is air pollution's long-term damages such as cancer. Lungs of children exposed to pollution become shrunken and damaged, with these children suffering from diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or asthma early on,"" he said.

"Air pollutant levels drop in 3 yrs, but still in red: Report","Mumbai: The air quality in Mumbai has improved in the last three years, with the average levels of pollutants dipping significantly, according to the BMC's Environment Status Report (ESR) 2017-18 released recently. However, the levels of the air pollutants remain much above the Central Pollution Control Board's permissible limits. According to the report, the annual average PM 10 (particulate matter lesser than 10 microns) levels in 2017-18 for the nine locations monitored by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) were above the permissible limit of 60 \xB5g/m3 (micrograms per cubic metre of air)-overall average for Mumbai was 93 \xB5g/m3. The average levels of the more hazardous PM 2.5 (lesser than 2.5 microns) were between 38 and 68 \xB5g/m3 this year-overall average for Mumbai was 54 \xB5g/m3. Only Worli recorded an annual average lesser than the permissible limit of 40 \xB5g/m3. The most critical of all air pollutants, PM -a mix of solid and liquid particles, including smoke and arsenic-gets lodged in lung tissues. At the four monitoring sites of BMC, nitrogen dioxide levels were in the range of 62 to 76 g/m3 (grams per cubic metre of air) this year, much above the permissible limit of 40 g/m3. High levels of PM and nitrogen dioxide could be hazardous to health. /""Short-term exposures to both would increase the risk of respiratory symptoms. For instance, increase in exposure to particulate matter is linked to increase in respiratory symptoms, hospital visits and increased risk of cardio respiratory illness,"" said Sumi Mehta, environmental health expert. Dr Altaf Patel, director of medicine at Jaslok Hospital, said, ""Our priorities are imbalanced as we building taller skyscrapers and more highways but not looking at striving to give cleaner air to our citizens. Not able to inhale clean air only leads to an increase in respiratory illnesses like asthma as well as heart disease.""Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR, said it is necessary to further study the source of emissions to achieve permissible limits. ""Mumbai has the sea breeze washing out the pollutants but it cannot depend on that. The sources of pollution vary at each location,so it is necessary that we identify these sources and create an action plan to tackle the pollution levels,"" he said. Activists say the report doesn't reflect the ground situation. ""We are witnessing an increase in the complaints about air pollution. One of the major causes of it is the unorganised industries sector. Unauthorised burning takes place at many of these industries which goes unchecked. Besides, the dust generated from the Ready Mix Concrete (RMC) plants is also very dangerous and these still continue to operate within the city limits. There is a need to move these out immediately,"" said Godfrey Pimenta from NGO, Watchdog Foundation.Similarly, Khar-based activist Zoru Bathena said, ""The three locations where PM levels are above prescribed levels have heavy traffic. People today want to use own vehicles... Another source of pollution is the heavy construction... There is fine dust seen coming from construction work which only leads to worsening the air quality."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Asthma cases skyrocket as air pollution chokes the city,"Coimbatore: The number of people diagnosed with asthma in the city is increasing, head of the respiratory medicine department at PSG Hospitals Dr Anupama Murthy said. ""We are seeing more children affected by the condition. Also, we used to get only cases with family history before, unlike now,"" she said while speaking at the Tamil Nadu and Puducherry State Conference on Pulmonary Diseases held at PSG Hospitals on Saturday.Pulmonologists say they are seeing at least a 10% to 15% increase in cases of asthma, with some of them showing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) symptoms. /Doctors blame it on air pollution.Two decades ago, the high incidence of wheezing and asthma cases in Coimbatore, especially in the southern part of the city, was blamed on debris released from cotton mills. However, despite many of the mills shutting down, the number of asthma cases are only increasing, doctors said.""It is mainly because of the increase in air and industrial pollution,"" said Dr Murthy. ""The high level of pollution along with seasonal variations is increasing the high responsiveness of patients' airways. They become prone to attacks when they inhale dust particles or allergants.""Pollutants including ground-level ozone and nitrous oxide, when inhaled, go deep inside lungs and the damage almost becomes permanent. ""However, when it happens to people around the age of 10, the damage can be reversed and like asthma, can be treated. If the damage is permanent, they start having symptoms of COPD,"" said Dr R Narasimhan, pulmonologist from Apollo Hospitals, Chennai.The increase in pollution is mainly due to increase in the number of vehicles on the road, the doctors observed. ""The number of two-wheelers being sold everyday is increasing across the state. Many independent houses are being converted into apartment complexes with basement parking lots,"" said Dr Narasimhan. ""The only way to reverse this situation is to increase the use of public transport and improve the quality of public transport. They should make tolls higher, so people stop using own vehicles. Also, new vehicles should be used for public transport, so that they don't emit harmful gases.""""The state government should implement strict pollution norms and increase green cover,"" suggested Dr Logamurthy, pulmonologist from Chennai.

'Raj tops in lung disease deaths in India',"Jaipur: Rajasthan is leading among the states with highest burden of chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD) followed by Uttar Pradesh and Haryana in 2016.The two large north Indian states of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh had the highest deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) rate due to asthma too, says a study 'The Burden of Chronic Respiratory Diseases and their Heterogeneity across the States of India: The Global Burden of Disease Study 1990-2016' published in Lancet Journal on Wednesday.The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Indian Council of Medical Research of the department of health research, government of India.""To understand DALY, we can take an example that if average age of life in the state is 60, but a person dies at 50 due to COPD or any other disease and his healthy life remained affected for five years before death, then we can say that DALY is 15 years. The situation is really not encouraging as the state topped in the list of such states which has highest deaths due to COPD,"" said Dr Virendra Singh, director Asthma Bhawan, who was one of the researchers of the study. Dr Singh said, ""There is a need for a comprehensive research which should be backed by the state government to find out what makes Rajasthan the worst place for COPD patients and why the state is leading in number of deaths due to COPD.""The study pointed out that the dominant risk factor for COPD in India in 2016 was air pollution, which contributed more than half the DALYs due to COPD, followed by smoking, which contributed a quarter for the COPD DALYs. /But, it further elaborated that there have been increasing attempts in India to understand the association between causes other than smoking and COPD, given that a substantial portion of COPD cases occur in people who have never smoked.Dr Singh said that there must be other reasons for COPD apart from air pollution and smoking. ""The minute dust particles in the state could be one of the reasons. As study has highlighted that COPD is a major health concern there is a need for through research to ascertain cases of COPD burden,"" Dr Singh said. In India, the leading cause of death is heart attack but in Rajasthan, the leading cause of death is COPD. The study also suggested that there is a need for timely and accurate diagnosis of COPD. The study says, ""This high rate of health loss COPD is due to issues related to its relatively late diagnosis and management, even with the improvements in healthcare over time in India. Evidence suggests that COPD is underdiagnosed in India, partly because diagnosis is mostly based on symptoms rather than spirometry and also because symptomatic people are often late in seeking care because of insufficient awareness of the disease.""It further explained that studies have suggested that poor management of asthma in childhood also affects lung growth and increases the risk of developing COPD at later ages.

Dry climate brings back waste burning,"Aurangabad: The city is witnessing a surge in waste burning incidents over the last week, amid rising temperatures. Rampant burning of waste across the city is adding to air pollution. /This has got air quality experts and doctors concerned.In-charge of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) solid waste management cell Nandkishore Bhombe said that waste burning attracts penalty and appealed people not to indulge in the practice.Around seven months after the AMC was barred from dumping waste at Naregaon or Mandki dump yard, heaps of mixed waste continue to be dumped on street corners and roadsides.At several locations, the waste is set afire by people leading to air pollution. The burnt waste can contain all kinds of material like plastic, rubber, paint, metal and organic material.Nisha Natkar, who stays on Smashan Maroti Temple Road, says that the frequent burning of waste in the locality makes it very difficult for residents to breathe.""Over a period of time, inhaling the smoke causes irritability in the throat,"" she said.Ear, nose and throat specialist Ramesh Rohiwal said that burning waste releases gases like carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide.""Inhaling the smoke leads to irritation of the delicate nasal mucosa, irritation in throat, trachea, walls of trachea, running nose, cough. Irritable throat is also a precursor to nasal allergy and asthma,"" said Rohiwal.Air quality expert Geetanjali Kaushik said waste burning is a serious issue.""In addition to gaseous contaminants, carcinogenic dioxins and furans are also released,"" said Kaushik.Bhombe said that municipal corporation has taken action against several individuals for burning waste.

Asthma among Chandigarh kids rises from 3% to 6%: Study,"CHANDIGARH: The prevalence of asthma in children in Chandigarh has increased from 2%-3% to 5%-6% in the last decade, according to an ongoing Global Asthma Network study conducted worldwide.PGI is one of the centres in the country where 6,000 children were included in the study. The two age groups were between 6 and 7 years and 13 and 14 years. ""We are in the process of compiling the report. /The study includes children from government and private schools. We found almost two times the rate of prevalence as compared to the past decade,"" said Dr Meenu Singh, pulmonologist, PGI, who has been conducting this study.The study is being analysed from other parts of the world, including 120 countries. Already, three such studies have been conducted as a part of the Global Asthma Network. It is believed that the rise in the city is due to various risk factors. ""There has been a rise in food allergies, obesity and fungus growth due to dampness and a lot of construction in and around the city. Also, there is a hypothesis that Caesarean section deliveries also increase the risk of asthma in children,"" said Dr Meenu.According to WHO, between 15 and 20 million people have asthma in India and the prevalence is high at 10% to 15% in 5 years and 11-year-old children. ""We see more than 100 patients every week. We were seeing less than 50 such patients a decade ago. And every day there are around 15 children in the PGI OPD,"" said Dr Meenu.The reasons for the prevalence of asthma in Chandigarh include amongst others air pollution attributed to the increase in vehicles, allergies, increased consumption of tobacco, incorrect treatment in children, ignorance amongst parents, seasonal variations and weather fluctuations. ""There has been a lifestyle change where comfort has resulted in many risk factors for respiratory diseases. Excessive carpeting, curtains, cushiony sofas and keeping pets, especially cats inside the houses, add to the allergens causing asthma,"" said Dr SK Jindal, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine, PGI.

"Pulmonary diseases up by 46% in UP since '90, claims study","LUCKNOW: The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Uttar Pradesh has gone up by over 46% since 1990, according to assessment of data published in a Lancet study.The study was titled 'The Burden of Chronic Respiratory Diseases and their Heterogeneity across the States of India: The Global Burden of Disease Study 1990-2016'.Against an estimated burden of 52 lakh COPD cases in the 1990s, UP is home to 98.6 lakh COPD patients today. The paper noted that after Rajasthan, UP accounted for the highest burden of COPD among Indian states.The study also found that UP and Rajasthan accounted for the highest deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) rate due to asthma, too. A 2017 study by Population Health Foundation of India noted that COPD was the leading cause of deaths in Uttar Pradesh. /The Lancet study pointed out that the dominant risk factor for COPD in India in 2016 was air pollution, which contributed more than half the DALYs due to COPD. This was followed by smoking, which contributed a quarter for COPD DALYs in 2016.Expert of lung diseases and former director of Patel Chest Institute, New Delhi, Prof Rajendra Prasad stated that tiny dust particles in the air could trigger COPD.""Against a daily requirement of 2kg of food and 3 litres of water, an adult inhales and exhales about 8 litres of air every single minute. Of this, only 20% is oxygen. Pollutants, affect the quality of lung function which paves way for diseases,"" he explained.

"Toxic fumes and chemical run-off will continue to plague Kolkata, warn experts","KOLKATA: The inferno at Bagri Market on Sunday has caused the extreme ambient air pollution and people who have been exposed to the poisonous fumes may have immediate health problems as a result, felt experts. The blaze will have a long-term affect too, they said.The extent to which such blazes can impact the environment is determined by the presence of flammable items at the spot, the hazard of the toxins and the risk of a fire event occurring, the experts added.These non-routine release of fumes can spell extreme environmental disaster to the immediate surroundings. Since the Burrabazar building was packed with plastic and chemicals, the smoke was vicious. /Apart from immediate respiratory ailments, it could cause critical ilnesses in the long run - including cancer, said Dr Amitava Bandyopadhyay, professor of chemical engineering at Calcutta University. He has been researching on fire and its chemical impact on the human body.""In the chemical industry there are material safety data sheet to list preventive measures against release of fumes from each chemical. These should also be maintained at markets where hazardous chemicals are stored. The chemicals and the burnt plastic complicated the scenario on Sunday. There must be risk analysis against such warehouse facilities,"" he added.Bandyopadhyay said there was also an absence of study on the long-term impact of such fire on the environment. ""The toxic gaseous chemicals released during burning of plastic include nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and polycyclic organic matter (POMs - a solid residue). Burning plastic also releases heavy metals and toxic chemicals, like dioxin. It is a risk even for firemen,"" said emission consultant Somendra Mohan Ghosh.Since the fire is being extinguished with water, the hazard is the chemical run-off. The water flows into the Hooghly and affects fish and algae. The chemicals are absorbed and metabolized. The toxicity of the exposed organism depends on its population and size, as well as on the potency of the chemicals. Ultimately, the toxicity can lead to birth defects in the species.

"'Stubble burning down 60%, will vanish next year'","Punjab environment minister O P Soni says that the government has subsidized around 1,000 farm implements used for managing paddy stubble and plans to make to nearly 19,000 more such machines available soon. In an interview with TOI, the minister, however, admits that vote bank politics comes in the way of awareness drive against burning of crop residue. Here are the excerpts:The issue of stubble burning has been examined everywhere, from the Supreme Court to the NGT. What is the development in Punjab?/We have successfully managed to bring down the cases of stubble burning by around 60% and so the pollution levels too have come down accordingly. We have set up district-level committees across the state, which work in coordination with the Punjab Pollution Control Board, state agriculture department and other agencies. The committees visit villages to create awareness among the farmers and educate them about the ill effects of stubble burning not only on environment but also their farmland.Since the reason behind farmers burning crop residue is largely economical in nature, how are you dealing with that aspect?We are providing agricultural implements to farmers, like happy seeder, mulching machines, choppershredder and zero till drill for straw management, on 40 to 50% subsidy. So far, we have given around 1,000 farm machines and our target is to give 20,000 machines by the next season. Beside this, HPCL is setting up a plant in Bathinda district to convert paddy and wheat straw into bioethanol and another similar plant is also coming up in Bathinda to convert straw into carbon-enriched fuel in coal form, which will be sold to power companies.Is there any plan to give cash subsidy to farmers to stop them from stubble burning?No. There are no such plans. We are providing them farm implements on handsome subsidy. This is the only option and a viable one. Farmers will get manure in their fields and they won't have to spend as much on buying fertilizers.They have nothing to lose and the stubble burning problem will also be eradicated.What challenges are you facing in making farmers stop burning stubble?Despite being advised against it repeatedly, farmers still risk violating rules and set ablaze stubble late in the night or early morning. The department takes action against them. There will be zero tolerance this time since stubble burning is one of the main causes of air pollution. According to the instruction of the NGT, the farmers found burning stubble will have to pay environmental compensation ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 15,000.Are politicians worried about losing votes if they lead the drive against farm fires?To some extent, it is correct but let me tell you that our government is doing everything for a cleaner environment. We will ensure strict compliance of law and I also request everyone to tackle the issue of stubble burning by rising above the politics. In a short span of time, we have done a lot of work.The AAP government in Delhi has repeatedly blamed Punjab for toxic smog cover over its sky.Some things take time. We have already started working to eliminate the problem of stubble burning in Punjab. We are doing whatever is required and that's why our government has launched 'Tandrust Punjab Mission' of which I am the vice-chairman. Our efforts are bearing fruits and I believe that by next season we will be able to eliminate toxic smokes rising from our fields. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
It's a different story in Germany,"BENGALURU: For the first quarter this year, Graphite India saw its gross sales surge 373% to Rs 1,965 crore and profit rise 49% year-onyear to Rs 957 crore. And one of the reasons behind its stellar growth over the past year has been China's push for cleaner and greener energy.With Chinese graphite factories shutting down, Indian graphite makers have had to go full blast to meet the soaring demand. The round-the-clock shifts has resulted in the air turning blacker than ever, say residents living near the Graphite India factory in Whitefield.Graphite India shares have risen 1200% since the beginning of the year, never mind the recent dip on talk of the Bengaluru factory shutting down. /Graphite India has six factories in India and one in Nuremberg, Germany.The Graphite COVA GmbH factory in Nuremberg is a sore point for Whitefield residents for it is fully compliant with European standards that mandate PM2.5 levels below 10\xB5g/m3 for the year and below 25\xB5g/m3 for a day.

Diabetes surge a worry but can be rolled back,"As a diabetologist and researcher who has been working on diabetes for over 40 years, I have seen my practice grow from a small clinic to a hospital chain with centres across the country. Nevertheless, I was amazed to see the results of a recent study published in Lancet Global Health indicating the scale of the problem today. The number of people with diabetes in India increased from 26 million in 1990 to 65 million in 2016, with the prevalence increasing from 5.5% to 7.7% over this period. The highest prevalence was seen in Tamil Nadu (13.1%) followed by Kerala, Delhi, Punjab, Goa and Karnataka. /The state with the most individuals with diabetes, however, was Uttar Pradesh, a reflection of its huge population. Thus, there were 8.38 million people with diabetes in UP with Tamil Nadu being a close second with 7.17 million, despite having 1/4th the population of UP. The highest increase in diabetes rates was seen in the poorer states.In the 1970s, the prevalence of diabetes in cities like Chennai was 2%, while in rural areas, it was 0.5 to 1%. But today, almost a quarter of Chennai's population has diabetes. At age 55, almost 40% of the population of Chennai has diabetes and another 35% has pre-diabetes which means that in older people, only a quarter of the population has normal glucose tolerance.The Lancet paper concludes that the major driver of the epidemic in India is increased body weight (obesity). Unhealthy diet and low physical activity also contribute, while the newer risk factors identified are tobacco and exposure to second-hand smoke (air pollution). Diabetes in India differs from that seen in the west, in that, even with lesser degrees of obesity, Indians are prone to type 2 diabetes. While the exact mechanisms are not known, it is believed that there could be inherent genetic (ethnic) susceptibility factors. Moreover, the high carbohydrate diet that we eat also contributes significantly. In South India, this is predominantly due to polished white rice consumption which leads to an increased demand on the pancreatic beta cells, eventually leading to their exhaustion and hence to diabetes. This, coupled with decreased physical activity, has been shown to be a major contributing factor. A worrisome trend is that diabetes is no longer a rich man's disease and has moved to the middle income group and even the poor. Diabetes rates in urban slums and the rural poor are rising fast. The problem is that these are highly vulnerable populations as they are unable to afford treatment for diabetes. It is estimated that 25% to 35% of a poor person's income can be taken up by treatment of diabetes.The increase in diabetes in rural India is also a problem because in many villages, specialized health care is not readily available. People with diabetes need an annual check-up of eyes, kidney, heart and feet apart from other tests. It is also important to make all essential drugs available across the country. A recent study by us showed that insulin is available only in 76% of pharmacies in India - its non-availability was mostly in rural areas, perhaps related to the lack of electricity and refrigerators to store it.Another worry is that diabetes is moving from older people to middle aged and young adults, and even to adolescents and children. As it takes only 15-20 years to develop complications of diabetes, when these children become young adults, they run the risk of developing eye, kidney, heart, nerve and other problems. If this happens to millions of people, it can be an economic disaster for the country. Diabetes has the potential to do to India what HIV did to countries in Africa. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), in the next few years, India will overtake China and become the world diabetes capital. The estimated number of Indians with diabetes by 2045 is 134 million -- which I believe is a very conservative estimate. Luckily for us, it is eminently possible to prevent diabetes. In the Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement Program, we showed that by making the diet healthier by cutting down on carbohydrate and including more protein, fibre, healthy fats and green leafy vegetables as well as regular exercise, i.e. walking for 30 minutes at least five days a week, it was possible to prevent diabetes in almost a third of people with pre-diabetes. With the epidemic continuing to grow, governments, policymakers, NGOs and the public, along with the medical profession, must get together to stop diabetes in its tracks. The time to act is now!

A slightly old man, probably in his 50s or 60s, tightening his grip on his chest, wincing in pain. You'd be shocked to know that while the risk of heart attack increases with age, younger men and women in their 30s and 40s too fall in the high-risk category due to their high pressure lifestyle. Furthermore, a recent study stated that heart attack among women is more prevalent these days. /""Hi. I had a LAD heart attack last September 11th. My LAD was estimated to be 70 per cent blocked. I was 34 years old and had a stent put in. I didn't have many warning signs. I drank too much. I was marginally overweight. My cholesterol numbers were not great, but not horrible. My BP was a tiny bit high, but nothing crazy. I was going through a huge amount of stress at the time, which may or may not have contributed. I'm a former College athlete. I lifted weights 2-4 times a week. Didn't do much cardio, but I never thought I'd have a HA at such a young age."" A man shared this account on an online support network, which spurred a series of responses from others in the same age group. Not many know, Indians are genetically predisposed to coronary artery disease. Hence, even someone who is very particular about a healthy lifestyle may not be aware of certain changes in the heart. At times, a routine checkup can diagnose blockages in people who may never have experienced any heart-related ailments. Statistics show a scary picture too. Dr Dinesh Agarwal, Senior Technical Advisor - Health, Nutrition & Wash of IPE Global says, ""Ischemic heart disease and stroke were estimated to account for nearly 15-20 percent of all deaths in India in 2016. WHO has set out a goal of 25 percent reduction in premature mortality due to non-communicable disease by 2025"" Indians are getting a heart attack 8 to 10 years earlier than other ethnic groups and about 40 per cent of these are under the age of 55. Dr Vishal Rastogi, Principal Interventional Cardiologist, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute & Research Centre, Okhla Road adds, ""On World Heart Day, there is a need to raise awareness on the risk factors and importance of timely health checkups particularly in those above the age of 35. Some symptoms to watch out for include shortness of breath, extensive fatigue, fluid build-up fluid in the body, persistent cough or wheezing, appetite loss, nausea, confusion, and increased heart rate. It is imperative for those above 40 to undergo detailed tests such as calcium scoring by CT scan to detect any abnormalities. Prevention should begin early in life. People should get checked on time, undertaken age-appropriate health checkups, and be aware of risk factors."" Women need to more careful as the symptoms they experience may not be the same as those in men. Manage your risk factors such as high blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes.Padma Shri Awardee, Dr KK Aggarwal, President, HCFI and President (Elect), CMAAO further states, ""Statistics indicate that anywhere between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the heart attack patients today fall under the age bracket of 25 to 35 years. While the usual suspects such as sedentary lifestyles, stress, and family history of the condition are to be blamed, a lesser know fact is that air pollution, indoor and outdoor, is also a major contributing factor. Youngsters spend a lot of time in traffic commuting to work and meetings, etc. As per a study, traffic-related air pollution may increase the risk of developing heart diseases due to its effects on the good high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Exposure to toxic air for prolonged periods can also affect the vascular system. It is imperative for youngsters to either look for alternative modes of transport to get to work or ensure that they note the pollution levels while travelling and take adequate precautions. Needless to say, lifestyle changes such as exercise, healthy eating, and reducing stress will only add to these prevention strategies."" Adding to it, Dr M. Udaya Kumar Maiya, Medical Director, Portea Medical says, ""The prevalence of heart diseases among young Indians is on the rise. Apart from risk factors such as unhealthy eating, work-related stress is emerging as a major cause for this condition among the youth. Statistics indicate that those who work for about 55 hours a week face a 33% increased risk of stroke than those who work for 35 to 40 hours. This is true for both men and women. Increased work stress and dependence on gadgets disrupts the body's internal systems."" On World Heart Day, awareness should be raised on judicious use of technology. ""Youngsters should take what can be called a 'smartphone break' and some time off work in order to ensure that their body can regain its balance. Meditation and relaxation techniques can help reduce stress. It is imperative to follow a heart-healthy lifestyle,"" adds Dr Maiya.Keep your heart healthy! For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Rare recognition for Sree Chitra in cardiac care,"Thiruvananthapuram: The Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) has been granted the 'centre for advanced research and excellence' status by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). The ICMR, which is establishing 10 centres of advanced research and excellence in the country, in areas like cancer, diabetology, cardiology, mental health, air pollution, etc., has given approval to SCTIMST to set up a 'CARE centre for cardiology in heart failure' at the institute.""The approval is to establish an advanced centre for research in the field of heart failure, which is an emerging problem in the country. The mortality rate of cardiac diseases, 45% in three years, is higher than many common cancers,'' said Dr S Harikrishnan, professor of cardiology.To establish the centre of excellence, ICMR will provide Rs 5crore for the next five years. SCTIMST under Dr Harikrishnan has published the data from Trivandrum heart failure registry, which is now established as a cohort into its fifth year. /This is the only heart failure cohort in India.As part of the centre of excellence and research in SCTIMST, the proposed activities are to develop a national database of heart failure, to establish a biobank of heart failure patients to study genetic, metabolomics and proteomic markers of health outcomes in heart failure patients, said Dr Harikrishnan. It would also study the micro-economic and psychosocial impact of heart failures and to develop quality improvement initiative of task sharing and m-health (mobile phone-based) interventions by trained nurses and family care givers in improving the practice of evidence-based care for management of heart failure in India, he added.It would also develop point-of-care (POC) device systems with the help of biomedical technology wing of SCTIMST to aid management of patients with heart failure. ""This is the recognition of the good work done by Sree Chitra in the field of heart diseases. This centre of excellence will pave the way for testing treatment modifications suited to India and newer devices in the field of heart failure,"" said Dr Asha Kishore, SCTIMST director.

E-rickshaws to surpass autorickshaws in city,"PATNA: E-rickshaws will soon outnumber the traditional auto-rickshaws in the state capital, a state transport department official said on Sunday. He said the number of e-rickshaws registered almost 100% growth as compared to the last year's figures. Around 3,500 e-rickshaws are plying on the city roads, compared to 2,200 last year.There are around 4,000 autorickshaws in the city. /Officials said these autorickshaws are also a major cause of air pollution because their drivers mix much cheaper kerosene in petrol and diesel. E-rickshaws, on the other hand, can ply in narrow lanes and offer last mile connectivity. According to sources, over 100 agencies have started selling e-rickshaws in Patna.""The numbers of e-rickshaws in Patna have shot up 100% as compared to last year. The department is promoting the environment-friendly means of public transport. Therefore, the registration fee for e-rickshaws are also kept 50% less as compared to other means of public transport. The district magistrates are authorized to decide routes for e-rickshaws,"" state transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said.He said the transport department has already stopped giving permits to traditional autorickshaws to curb air pollution in the city. As of now, e-rickshaws ply on Ashok Rajpath, Station road, Boring Road, Bailey Road (Nehru Path), Kurji and Patna City routes. The passengers can be spotted enjoying the ride despite the slow speed of e-rickshaws.Prashant Kumar, a resident of Mahendru in Patna, said: ""We find e-rickshaws more comfortable than the noisy autorickshaws that run on petrol or diesel and heavily contribute to air pollution. The traffic condition in the city also favours e-rickshaw as it's slow. But there is a need of further technological improvements such as better breaks and more speed.""He further said: ""Sometimes we see overloading on e-rickshaws too. That should be curbed by transport department and traffic police.""Bihar State Pollution Control Board chairman Ashok Ghosh said: ""Traditional autorickshaws are to be banned as they emit higher levels of smoke. The plan is under process and it will be implemented throughout the state as well as in Patna.""He said the autorickshaws are a major cause of alarming levels of air pollution in the city.

"Crop fires start, we will know only by October-end if they have come down","NEW DELHI: Stubble-burning has begun in parts of Punjab and Haryana, satellite images reveal. The pattern of farm fires are similar to what was seen around this time last year, with areas affected at the moment mainly in the Karnal-Ambala-Yamunanagar belt in Haryana and the Amritsar region of Punjab. ""There is a haze across the northern plains but it's mainly due to local pollution and dust hanging in the air due to calms winds. /There is no impact yet in the region from stubble burning,"" said Dipankar Saha, former head of air pollution monitoring at the Central Pollution Control Board. Agriculture experts say farmers who grow potato and other vegetables are the first to burn their rice stubbles. ""These farmers grow short duration rice varieties that mature quickly and are harvested early. The areas from where fires are being reported are also the potato, vegetable and maize belts where the number of these farmers is high. These growers, who are less than 10% of PunjabHaryana farmers, have a very small sowing window and do not yet have an attractive alternative to burning,"" said M L Jat, agricultural scientist at international non-profit organisation, CIMMYT, who is tracking developments in the region.The main stubble burning season normally begins after October 15 and continues for around a month. That's the period when farmers are readying their fields for sowing wheat. ""Among these farmers, we expect at least a 30% reduction in stubble-burning this year due to a combination of increased awareness and surging sales of stubble management implements such as happy seeders etc,"" Jat added. Meanwhile, IMD officials said there has been no incursion of dust into the region, as feared earlier. ""We also see no such incursion taking place in the next few days. What we are seeing right now are typical pre-winter conditions, with a haze over the region,"" said B P Yadav, head of IMD's regional meteorological centre. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"In 2016, asthma claims 10,000 in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, 48,000 die of COPD","HYDERABAD: Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are witnessing a severe trend of respiratory diseases (COPD -Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disorders). Around 19,000 deaths were reported in Telangana and 29,000 deaths in AP due to COPD out of 8.48 lakh deaths across India in 2016. Similarly, around 4,000 deaths in Telangana and 6,000 deaths in Andhra were reported due to asthma in 2016 of the 1.83 lakh asthma deaths in the country. A recent Lancet study revealed that though the situation is better in the two Telugu states when compared nationally, AP has a higher risk of asthma prevalence than Telangana. Air pollution, tobacco consumption and occupation risks were blamed for the high COPD prevalence.India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative CRD Collaborators in Lancet 2018 September publication revealed that the prevalence of COPD was the highest in the north in Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana. /Asthma prevalence in 2016 was highest in the northeast states and Kerala. Researchers found that the next highest asthma prevalence was in Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.Dr S Mallikarjun Rao, a senior pulmonologist at Apollo Hospitals, told TOI, ""Asthma is a genetic disease triggered by factors like humidity. Andhra Pradesh is on the sea coast and has a high incidence of asthma. It is reversible with medication. The onset of asthma starts at an early stage where patients experience cough, breathlessness and suffer asthma attacks."" He added, ""COPD that affects lungs is a progressive, permanent disorder that affects mostly the elderly. Patients feel breathlessness, swelling of the face and are not able to walk. It is a lifelong disorder and decreases quality of life. COPD is due to smoking, and around 90% of patients have a smoking history. In the OPD relating to the pulmonology wing, 70% of cases fall in COPD or asthma categories."" The study was conducted in 29 states and Union Territories. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Green advice on Delhi air ends in smoke and fire,"NEW DELHI: At a time when poor air quality has much of Delhi in a frenzy, President Ramnath Kovind's Vijayadashmi address on Friday dwelled on living in harmony with the environment. The president exhorted people not to cause air pollution even while celebrating festivals.Speaking at a ceremony organised by the Luv-Kush Ramlila Committee at Red Fort grounds, Kovind, flanked by PM Narendra Modi and several ministers, urged countrymen to draw lessons from the life of Rama. The grounds resounded with the sound of firecrackers as Rama's fiery arrows struck down Ravana, Meghnad and Kumbhakarna to cinders. /The crowd cheered, clapped and whistled as the ""demons"" smouldered. Devotees chanted ""Siyawar Ramachandra ki jay"" all along. Moments earlier, the crowd cheered on as Modi fumbled twice in his attempt to shoot an arrow towards the effigies. Incidentally, last year, Modi's bow had broken while performing the same role at the ceremony. But before the effigies were set afire, President Kovind said showing respect to people of all sections of the society, especially the poor, was as much a relevant message today as it was during the times of Rama. He recounted examples from Ramayana to reinforce his point. Kovind said while festivals should be celebrated, they shouldn't cause inconvenience to others. ""We should keep noise and air pollution under control and maintain cleanliness. Lord Rama triumphed over Ravana only by keeping a balance between people and nature,"" he said. Kovind added that Vijayadashmi gave out the message of adopting moral and dignified behaviour. ""Despite being a learned man, Lankesh is forever remembered as symbol of evil due to his immoral and inhuman behaviour,"" he said. Taking rounds of the corridors around the seating area while riding traditional wooden chariots were arch-enemies Rama and Ravana - engaged in the perpetual fight of good and evil, shooting prop arrows at each other. People rushed to gather the bamboo arrows, considering them to be lucky charms. The Ramlila stage, with its mythological setting and chariots, gave a dramatic backdrop to the selfies that thousands were busy clicking. While thousands of people thronged the grounds to witness the Ramlilas organised by three of the oldest committees in the city, there was no dearth of VIPs either. A function organised by the Nav Dharmik Ramlila Committee saw the presence of Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh. Not far away, newly appointed Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi was the guest at Shri Dharmik Lila Committee event. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal picked up the bow and arrow at the Indraprastha Ramlila Committee's celebrations. As has become a custom in the past few years, there was a fourth effigy: selected to represent this year's villainy, the effigy was named ""parichit balatkari"" - rapists known to the survivors. Kejriwal reduced it to ashes.Ironically, claims of an environmentally conscious Dussehra had gone up in smoke by the time the various events concluded. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"In a first, WHO calls global meet to tackle pollution","NEW DELHI: Alarmed at the rising levels of pollution causing growing burden of diseases and deaths, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has called health and environment ministers of all countries including India, global leaders and experts from academia and scientific community for the first time to devise a strategy to combat pollution and its impact on health. The high-level three-day meeting, slated from October 30 to November 1 in Geneva, is likely to determine ambitious targets for countries, mainly those where morbidity and mortality is higher. India may have to face flak at the global stage with the further dipping of air quality in Delhi and northern region this weekend, sources said. /""The timing is such that India is likely to face increased criticism as pollution levels are going to increase from here with stubble fires in Haryana and Punjab as farmers get ready to sow winter crops and a possible firecracker spurt on Diwali ,"" an official said. Latest estimates from the UN agency show that of the 20 most polluted cities in the world, the top 14 are in India. While Kanpur, Faridabad and Varanasi were among the top three, others in the list include Delhi, Patna, Agra, Muzaffarpur, Srinagar, Gurgaon, Jaipur, Patiala and Jodhpur, followed by Ali Subah Al-Salem in Kuwait and a few cities in China and Mongolia. Outdoor air pollution accounted for over 10.87 lakh deaths in India in 2016, whereas household air pollution led to over 10.85 lakh deaths. The agenda drawn by WHO for the meeting insists that affordable strategies exist to reduce key pollution emissions from the transport, energy, agriculture, waste and housing sectors and countries must adopt health-conscious strategies to reduce climate change and support sustainable development goals for health, energy and cities.

"Eye on stubble burning, Delhi wakes up to waste and leaves burnt in backyard","NEW DELHI: Stubble burning by Punjab farmers, which aggravates air pollution in Delhi, may be occupying all attention but there is another menace here at home. Even as Delhi's air quality continues to deteriorate, open waste burning seems to be rampant in some areas. Dwarka residents took out a march on Saturday to highlight the violations at one particular spot. /Around the same time, members of the Environmental Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) were discovering to their horror thick plumes of black smoke rising from piles of garbage being burnt on the roads in Narela and Bawana in north-west Delhi. The team was led by EPCA chairman Bhure Lal. EPCA said they had received many complaints and that the entire area was found to be a hotspot for open waste burning. ""Both waste and plastic are being burnt on a large scale and we spent most of the day in firefighting operations. The area seems to be contributing in a major way to Delhi's pollution and we will take strict action against the violators,"" Bhure Lal told TOI. EPCA has called for a meeting of all agencies on Monday to discuss the issue. They will be directed to enforce the law strictly, particularly at the hotspots. ""Violations like these will not be tolerated,"" said Lal. Meanwhile, over 200 Dwarka residents marched from Brahma Apartments to a spot where garbage is frequently put on fire. The protest was organised by NGO Green Circle and supported by 15 other social groups. Data provided by SDMC shows that a fine for burning of garbage/leaves between October 1 and October 17 has been imposed in only one case. This, when satellite imagery shows that Dwarka has emerged as one of the places in the city with the maximum frequency of waste being burnt. The protesters pointed out that a garbage dump near Brahma Apartments alone has seen seven such instances of garbage fire in the past 15 days. The situation in Dwarka was discussed at a recent EPCA meeting where the latest satellite images showed red dots in the area. Munish Kundra of Brahma Apartments said: ""Our society is worst affected. Our senior citizens are unable to breathe since the burning happens near our society compound."" Addressing the protesters, MLA Bhavna Gaud assured them that she would ensure that garbage is lifted on a daily basis. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had directed all land-owning agencies in Delhi to impose a fine of Rs 5,000 on persons found burning waste in the open. NGT had also asked for setting up of proper composting pits. Experts have repeatedly pointed out the menace of garbage and leaf burning also indicates failure on part of the corporations to collect and dispose of garbage on a timely basis as well as utilize horticultural waste in the composting process. Studies show that nearly 29.4% of the total PM10 (coarse, pollution particles) are from waste burning, the NGT bench had observed. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air quality dips in Mumbai, BKC is worst","MUMBAI: The city woke up to a haze cover as air pollution levels in Mumbai deteriorated Monday morning. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) recorded an overall air quality of 142 which worsened to 177 by evening. An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered moderate and may be a health concern only for people sensitive to air pollution. Among the 10 locations monitored by SAFAR, the highest pollution level of 309 (very poor) was recorded at Bandra Kurla Complex. Chembur had the cleanest air with an AQI of 84 (satisfactory). Researchers attributed the fluctuations to wind speeds. ""Pollution levels are usually high in the morning and clear out by evening.

"Graded plan goes up in smoke, CPCB finds 21 'most polluted' areas in Gurgaon","Gurgaon: Monitoring teams appointed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has identified 21 most polluted spots in the city, where rampant violations of GRAP measures resulted in high levels of pollution.According to its report, IMT-Manesar, sectors 9 and 10, and stretches along the NH-8 were the worst affected areas during a period of three weeks starting around September-end, due to massive flouting of green norms, open dumping of construction and demolition waste, open storage of construction material and broken or uneven roads.Further, the CPCB report indicated open dumping of construction and demolition (C&D) waste has been one of the major contributing factors behind high pollution levels in Gurgaon.Sources said violations like open storage of construction material and unpaved roads were found to be the main reason for high level of particulate matter at eight out of the 21 places listed in the report. These apart, open burning of waste was reported in Manesar, especially in areas along NH-8, while industrial emissions were found in Bhiwadi industrial area and Sector 12.""All instances of violations, along with the GPS locations of the respective spots, have been uploaded on Sameer (an app that provides hourly updates on National Air Quality Index (AQI) published by CPCB). Moreover, we have informed the local authorities for immediate action,"" said a source at CPCB.Experts stressed the need to bring areas in New Gurgaon under the scanner, too. /""We are glad that the CPCB teams are monitoring the situation and highlighting violations that have been going on in different parts of the city for a very long time.

The CPCB teams should also carry out inspections in new Gurgaon, especially near Sector 29, which has become a dust bowl. I am sure the teams will visit other areas and make sure that GRAP measures are followed in all the areas.""About 40 monitoring teams formed by the CPCB have been deployed in NCR cities since September 15 to carry out inspections. The teams, each comprising two-three members, are monitoring factors that lead to an increase in air pollution and highlight the violation of the GRAP measures in each division/district. Weekly reports prepared by the teams are being submitted to the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) and the Prime Minister's Office. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Ahead of Diwali, Gurgaon gets ready to battle air pollution","Diwali may be two weeks away, but the air quality in Gurgaon has already dropped to 'very poor'. As per the data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) earlier this month, the air quality in the city has deteriorated to 'very poor' with the Air Quality Index (AQI) crossing 300. Since the air quality is expected to worsen after the festival, various organisations and corporates in the Millennium City have started taking preventive measures for a green Diwali. While some have decided to leave the city for a few days to celebrate the festival, others are going to run campaigns to encourage people to celebrate a pollution-free Diwali. Online campaigns for green Diwali: Gurgaon MomsWhile various groups in Gurgaon are planning to take preventive measures ahead of Diwali, the GurgaonMoms group is going to run online campaigns to create awareness among its members. ""Ahead of Diwali, we usually run many campaigns to encourage pollution-free Diwali. /We have accepted that there is a problem, and we want our members to fight for better air quality,"" says Neela Kaushik, founder of the group. ""Live sessions are conducted on our page where experts talk about simple measures that can be taken to prevent air pollution. These conversations include experts discussing about the air quality, indoor plants that purify air and things you can buy for a green Diwali. Simple things like not bursting crackers and not going for walks the morning after Diwali are also communicated during these conversations. We also ask our members to take a pledge to celebrate a pollution-free Diwali. Today, there are only a handful of people who say things like why do we always talk about air pollution during Diwali as times are changing and people have realised that the problem is quite real. More individuals are accepting the fact that we should focus on celebrating a green Diwali,"" adds Neela.Sherabanu Farosh, another member of the group and also a member of #MyRightToBreathe campaign, adds, ""We are focussing on informing people about the effects of pollution on the health and well-being of children and the elderly. Through our posts, we inform moms that if you let you child burn one phuljhadi, it is equivalent to the smoke emitted by 14 cigarettes. Nobody wants their kids to inhale that, and that is how we are creating awareness within the community.""The Millennium City covered in smog after Diwali last yearCorporates encouraging employees to take public transportMany corporate companies in Gurgaon are not only asking their employees to carpool but will also be applauding those who use public transport during the Diwali week. Sandeep Gulati, CEO, Egis India, tells us, ""Some of our colleagues are planning their vacation around Diwali so they can avoid the pollution. As a company, we are planning to encourage people to travel together in groups so that fuel consumption can be minimised. We have created a WhatsApp group to promote this initiative. We are also looking at organising alternatives like battery operated vehicles for our employees to be ferried to and fro from the Metro. We are also sending a thank you note from the CEO to all those employees who are taking the Metro, so that they feel encouraged and motivate more people to join them.""Manas Fuloria, CEO, Nagarro, adds, ""As a company, we try to protect the air - we have air purifiers and filters inside the building. One important step that we all must take is to report cases of waste burning. I carry a bottle of water with me to pour over small fires on my way to office or home. We are trying to promote cycling, walking and the use of public transport. Employees in the office do carpooling. In general, people of Gurgaon are aware of the situation, so if you tell them to do something that will prevent pollution, they would be willing to do it.""Will be planting more trees with our members: Gurgaon NetworkKomal Manocha Chawla, founder of Gurgaon Connect, which has 35K members on Facebook, says that they will be organising plantation drives with their community members. ""We have 35K members on FB and we try to spread awareness through online posts and messages on WhatsApp. We ask our members to support a firecracker-free Diwali because this is what our environment needs. As responsible citizens, it is our duty to encourage our members to do the same. As part of the drives that we conduct, we plant trees with our community members as a small step to protect the environment,"" she says. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Court refers to 2 docs who raised red flags about health hazards,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court order on firecrackers quotes at least two top doctors, who have raised red flag over the health impact of increased air pollution post-Diwali. One of them, Dr M K Daga, did a study to assess the difference in health parameters before and after Diwali and found increased values of barium and strontium - metals used in firecrackers - in the urine samples of many people included in their survey.Speaking to TOI, the professor, director of Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC), said the study was conducted last year on about 800 people from different parts of Delhi. ""We conducted a door-to-door survey where people were asked about respiratory, skin, air, eye and other relevant symptoms pre-and post-Diwali. /Urine samples of randomly selected subjects were also taken,"" Dr Daga said, adding that though there was some increase in cough and breathlessness, these did not translate into any significant illness requiring immediate medical attention.""Air quality did worsen during Diwali and symptoms of eye, increased coughing, relatively more hospital visits, increased noise levels and high metal levels in urine reflect the adverse impact of firecrackers bursting. However, it was not significant statistically. A long-term study would be required to assess long-term health impacts of firecracker bursting,"" the MAMC study quoted in SC order states.Another doctor, Dr Arvind Kumar from Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, contended that in the aftermath of Diwali, there was an increase in the number of people coming with chest ailments and many of his operated patients returned with complaints of cough and breathlessness, without any other cause for the same. ""This has forced me to carry out innumerable chest X-rays and CT scans to confirm that the complaints are due to the exposure to toxins,"" the thoracic surgeon said.Dr G C Khilnani, professor and head, department of pulmonary medicine at AIIMS, said that even though Diwali is still a fortnight away, they are already seeing many existing patients with respiratory health issues complaining about exacerbation of symptoms. ""In my Monday OPD, more than 80% patients came with complaints of wheezing and coughing. I had no choice but to enhance their inhaler dosage and some of them had to be prescribed steroids,"" he said.Dr Khilnani added that the worst affected due to air pollution are usually young children and senior citizens, and those with lung diseases, such as asthma and bronchitis, and heart patients.

Experts hail SC move on firecrackers,"Jaipur: City's health experts welcomed the Supreme Court order on discouraging use of crackers. They pointed out Jaipur as one of the worst places for people with respiratory diseases. /""The city is one among 14 most air polluted cities of the world. The air of Jaipur is already toxic and use of crackers emitting smoke and loud sound makes the situation worse for children, elderly people and also those who are already suffering from respiratory diseases. The SC order for discouraging use of crackers has come as a major relief especially for the people who have weaker lungs,"" said Dr Virendra Singh, former Sawai Man Singh Hospital superintendent and senior pulmonologist. He pointed out that in some western countries, different kind of firecrackers are used which emit light but do not emit much smoke and that such crackers could be used here too. ""We import Chinese crackers. The markets are full of such crackers, which emit a lot of smoke. Such firecrackers should not be used as they make the air more toxic,"" said Dr Singh.Moreover, ENT experts claimed that every year they see patients with hearing loss due to loud sound of crackers. They said high-decibel crackers should be discouraged. ""Acute exposure to sudden sounds of 140 decibel crackers leads to deafness, which can sometimes be permanent. Also, there are cases where the ear drum is ruptured,"" said Dr Pawan Singhal, professor (ENT), SMS Medical College. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air quality threat looms over Bhopal,"BHOPAL: Going by the smart city pollution monitoring data, air pollution remains a daunting threat for Bhopal.Except for two days in a 30-day period data between August and October, PM 2.5 levels was double the 24-hour air quality standard as per the World Health Organisation (WHO), which is 25 ug/m3.In the last week of August, PM 2.5 levels hovered at a high of 450 to 640 g/m3 . Data collected is a daily average of the levels of the tiny and dangerous particulate matter, known as PM 2.5, which has the capability to lodge deeply into human lungs.Pollution monitoring by Bhopal smart city development corporation limited (BSCDCL) is on PPP-mode. Pollution monitors are functional in 43 locations across the city. They are fitted along with 100-plus smart street light systems, said a smart city official. /PM 2.5 levels above 300 can be hazardous, warn experts, calling formeasures now in order to avoid a situation like that of Delhi.""Ambient air quality is directly related to respiratory ailments. In the past few decades, the number of people suffering from respiratory ailments has doubled,"" said Lokendra Dave, chest physician and allergy specialist at Gandhi Medical College (GMC).Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution (per 100,000 population) is 133.7, going by national health profile, 2018.Ironically, much anticipated pollution data from smart city project has been pulled out of public domain.Trace gases (O3, SO2, and NOx) and black carbon (BC) particulates emitted by fireworks generate dense clouds of smoke that contain black powder (potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulphur). It is harmful, said experts. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"SC says only 'green' crackers this Diwali, bans online sale","NEW DELHI: This year's Diwali is set to be different as the Supreme Court on Tuesday permitted only ""green"" firecrackers with reduced noise and emission levels and fixed a two-hour period for bursting them during festivals and other celebrations to reduce air pollution. While turning down the plea for a blanket ban on the manufacture and sale of firecrackers across the country, a bench of justices A K Sikri and Ashok Bhushan, however, set out stringent standards for their manufacture besides putting restrictions on bursting them.Holding that smoke from firecrackers contributes significantly towards deteriorating air quality, particularly during Diwali, the bench also banned the online sale of firecrackers through e-commerce sites like Amazon and Flipkart. /The court also banned ""joined firecrackers"" (series crackers or ladis ) and directed police to ensure that only ""green"" crackers are sold in the country. The SC said: ""On Diwali day or on any other festivals like Gurpurab, etc, when such fireworks generally take place, it would strictly be from 8pm till 10 pm. On Christmas and New Year's Eve, when such fireworks start around midnight, it would be from 11.55pm till 12.30am only."" The timing would apply to other occasions like weddings. The court also banned ""joined firecrackers"" (series crackers or ladis) and directed police to ensure that only ""green"" crackers are sold in the country. In one of the directions, the court said firecrackers which have already been manufactured but do not fulfil the conditions fixed by it will not be sold in the NCR.

"Delhi air pollution: Pollution protection masks not very helpful, says AIIMS doctor","Every year during winters, the National Capital Region turns into a gas chamber as the air quality drops down to ""extremely poor"" level. Sadly, the whole air pollution debate goes for a toss as soon as the winter season ends and this outrage doesn't make a comeback until the next season.The worse part? With the onset of the cold season, the air pollution levels will only go up. Reportedly, this year the air quality nosedived after firecrackers were burst for Dussehra celebrations all around the country. This is the reason Supreme Court had temporarily banned the sale of firecrackers last year near Diwali.It is not only the firecrackers that are to be solely blamed for the toxic air as stubble burning by farmers around Delhi adds to the woes. /In fact, the Delhi government had recently put up a set of emergency rules to keep a check on the air pollution levels, including the closing of Badarpur thermal because of its contribution to the city pollution. While the heavily polluted Beijing has already started taking measures to turn the pollution clock back, the authorities in India seem to have done very little to fight for cleaner air. Speaking to Times of India, Dr Karan Madan, Assistant Professor in the Department of Pulmonary Medicine and Sleep Disorders, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) threw light on what exactly needs to be done in order to tackle the toxic air quality in India. When asked about the preemptive measures, he said, ""The important agenda in the long-term needs to be the reduction of emission of air pollution from the source itself, be it vehicular source or construction source. Staying indoors is not a solution as we all have to go out and get our chores done.""The most vulnerable groupDr Madan stressed, ""Patients with known respiratory diseases including asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), bronchitis etc. and small children are more susceptible to the side-effects of air pollution."" Don't exert yourself while outdoorsDr Madan also emphasized that when the air pollution levels are extremely high, small children and those with respiratory disease are strictly advised to avoid exertion, especially when they are outdoors.Are air purifiers effective? ""It must be kept in mind that air purifiers are effective only when it is operated in a completely closed room i.e. it needs a closed space to work properly. If you switch on the air purifier and one of the windows of the room is ajar, your air purifier will be completely ineffective. It is simply not a long-term solution. While it might not be an ideal solution for the majority of the population but those who tend to develop symptoms due to air pollution every year could consider using air purifiers. ""How to battle indoor pollution?""It is important to keep in mind that outdoor pollution levels can sometimes very closely mimic indoor pollution levels. If the pollution levels are high outside, most of the times it will be high indoors too. Hence, it is very difficult to prevent ourselves from getting exposed to air pollution. In fact, those who are asthmatic might even show symptoms to the vapours while cooking oily dishes.Surprisingly, burning biomass (wood and cow dung) is one of the most common causes of indoor pollution which results in incredibly high levels of air pollution.""How effective are the pollution protection masks?""Masks are only going to be effective if they are completely sealed. If there is even a slight air leak in the mask, there is absolutely no way to tell if you are breathing clean air or not. Also, the high-efficiency particulate mask put a lot of strain on your breathing if you wear it while jogging or doing heavy exercises. So, they are clearly not a long-term solution as it is nearly impossible to wear them all the time. Hence, while these masks look perfect in theory, there is no way to tell how effective they are in practical usage,"" said Dr Madan. Has Delhi become officially unlivable?Expressing his concern over the high levels of air pollution in the national capital, Dr Madan said, "" The levels of air pollution in Delhi is extremely bad for health and it has started to affect all the body parts. The long-term effects on the body will actually come to fore years later. This basically means we have to do everything possible to bring the pollution level down.""The bottom line""Sadly, the strategies we have right now are practically not very effective-- be it the air purifier or the masks--which is why in the long run, it is important to curb the menace rather than finding temporary solutions,"" the AIIMS doctor said.So, if packing your bags and leaving for Bali till the time air pollution doesn't settle down is not an option, here are a few ways in which you can safeguard yourself from this toxic air. 1. Always keep a check on the pollution levelAs a rule of thumb always make sure to check the pollution level before stepping out of your home. Especially, if you are living in a highly polluted city like Delhi it becomes essential to keep yourself updated on the air quality reports. 2. Download apps to check the air pollution levelNow is the time to put that smartphone to a good use. There are several apps available that can help you check the air pollution levels. Download one right away to measure pollutant levels no matter where you are and stay informed.3. Avoid going outside in mornings and evenings Till the time the air pollution levels get back to normalcy, it is strongly advised that you ditch that morning and even walk routine. This is because the air pollution level is recorded to be highest during the morning and evening, hence the more active you are during this time, the more polluted air you breathe. 4. Start wearing anti-pollution masksSorry to burst your bubble but covering your nose and mouth with a stole is not doing you any good. In fact, even those flimsy surgical masks that you get at dirt cheap prices from a medical store is not enough. Hence, if you really want to protect your lungs from being introduced to harmful particles in the air, you better invest in heavy-duty respirators. Here is how you can choose the best anti-pollution mask 5. Install air purifiers We pay so much attention to the outdoor pollution and fumes coming out of the cars that we often forget that indoor pollution is actually worse. Since we spend most of the time indoors, it is smart to invest in an air purifier. Keep in mind that you will need to replace the filter as per the recommendations of the air purifier and keep the room sealed while using it. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Lucknow residents are breathing 'very poor' air,"LUCKNOW: It was a day when Lucknowites felt like breathing in Delhi as city's air quality index (AQI) crossed 300 on Wednesday, the highest of post-monsoon season so far, signifying that it was 'very poor'.The air pollution is expected to increase in coming days with further drop in temperature, say experts.Environmentalists and weather experts held low temperature and poor wind velocity to be main reasons for AQI spike along with rising vehicular pollution, traffic congestion and dug up roads.Lucknow's AQI was 307, just 21 less than that of national capital, making the air figure in 'very poor' category, denoting that prolonged exposure can lead to severe respiratory illness.According to air pollution data released by Central Pollution Control Board, Lucknow's air was polluted mainly with PM10 and PM2.5, harmful small particulate matter with diameter of less than 10 and 2.5 micrometre, respectively.""Minimum temperature dropping to 15.6 degree Celsius is the main reason for air quality deterioration. Temperature drop and low wind velocity don't allow particulate matter to disperse which turns the city into a smoke chamber,"" said director Prof Dhruv Sen Singh of Lucknow University climate monitoring station.""Apart from climatic factors, various anthropogenic factors like increase in vehicular population, traffic, massive felling of trees that cannot be ignored,"" Singh said.The air quality has deteriorated early this year. /In the first week of October, the AQI reached 250 many times which usually happens towards the month end, said the Control Board.Times ViewPollution level in the city is expected to increase further in coming days. Last year, city air was most polluted in November and December. The impending health scare can be averted if authorities take immediate action. Since dust has been found to be main pollutant in the air, sprinkling of water on dusty roads, trees and vegetation and the enforcement of National Green Tribunal guidelines can check the dust problem to some extent. Also, ban on open garbage burning should be very strictly enforced. Traffic jams must also be prevented because vehicular exhaust is also one of the major pollution contributors.

Bleak Friday: Most polluted day in 4 months as haze sets in,"GURUGRAM: The city recorded its most polluted day in the past four months on Friday even though the air quality index (AQI) has been in the 'very poor' category for the past nine days. On Friday, AQI rose to 378, which is in the 'very poor' category, three notches higher than Thursday's AQI of 375. Meanwhile, the 24-hour average of PM2.5 levels was 210 micrograms per cubic metre. With this, Gurugram is inching closer to 'severe' levels of pollution.On the other hand, Faridabad remained the most polluted city in the country with an AQI of 381 ('very poor'), followed by Gurugram. /Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad also reported 'very poor' AQI at 361, 352 and 358, respectively. Greater Noida also recorded AQI of 352 ('very poor'). The maximum temperature in Gurugram and NCR on Friday rose to 31 degrees Celsius and the minimum dropped to 18. Wind speed was at a modest 10 km/hr as the air remained smoggy. As temperature dips further, foggy weather and misty mornings are expected in Gurugram in the following days. Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC) officials said that the cold would intensify with the mercury dropping to 16 degrees Celsius while rain was not on the anvil in the next few days. ""We are likely to witness thunderstorms on Friday evening. From Saturday onwards, skies will be clear at night but misty in the morning,"" said an official.Officials of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) once again blamed unfavourable weather conditions for the rise in pollution levels on Friday. ""The levels of particulate matter generally go up when the minimum temperature and wind speed drop. Meterological conditions are majorly responsible for rise in pollution levels. All measures under the graded response action plan (GRAP) for 'very poor' air are in place here,"" said an official. According to the Met officials, the situation is likely to worsen next week. ""The wind direction is expected to change next week with wind blowing from the west and so there is a possibility that stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana will spike air pollution levels in the city. Moreover, the ventilation index contributing to the dispersal of particulate matter in the lower atmosphere might go down, along with wind speed. These factors are likely to make the situation worse,"" said a Met official.Experts said that lifting the ban on firecrackers could worsen the situation in Delhi and NCR. ""Since air quality is already 'very poor' and close to 'severe' levels, there is an urgent need to take all preventive measures. But the ban on firecrackers has been lifted, this year, which might lead to a rise in air pollution levels, especially after Diwali. Also, weather conditions are unfavourable. All these factors can make this winter deadly for Gurugram,"" said Debjani Ghosh, an environmental engineer. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Air quality in city remains 'poor',"PATNA: It's not the vehicle emission but dust which contributes the most to the air pollution in the state capital, followed by Muzaffarpur and Gaya in the state.According to experts, the dust emanating from damaged roads and ongoing construction works are the biggest contributor (38%) to the total PM 2.5 levels (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometre), followed by vehicle pollution (20%) and household emissions (12%) in Patna.The air quality index (AQI) released by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Sunday shows air pollution levels 1.5 to 2 times more than the normal in the last week of this month. The AQI of Patna was 309, 314, 282 and 283 on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, respectively. It was 269 and 155 at Muzaffarpur and Gaya respectively on October 27.the air value in the range of 0-50 is considered good, 51-100 as satisfactory, 101-200 as moderate and 201-300 as poor. /It is considered very poor between 301 and 400 and considered severe above 400.Ankita, senior programme officer (air pollution) at the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED), said, ""The PM2.5 constitutes dust, very small particles of metals and smoke from vehicles. The biggest contributor to PM2.5 levels is dust particles emanating from bad road conditions and construction materials spread on roads.""She said there is lack of clear action plan in Bihar about air pollution control.

"AIIMS studying 7,000 to detect stroke, dementia","NEW DELHI: Some of the top neurologists at AIIMS are visiting south Delhi's Vasant Kunj and Munirka to promote healthy lifestyle among residents. They are testing people aged 50 and above, for high blood pressure, diabetes and thyroid for free to make a bank of their health profile and habits.Dr Kameshwar Prasad, who is leading the exercise, told TOI that the idea is to track the health profile and lifestyle of individuals to see how and why certain people develop stroke and dementia - two common neurological disorders.""Earlier research shows that high blood pressure, smoking and obesity are key risk factors for developing these diseases. But we want to do it locally and at a larger scale to identify new factors which can make the treatment more precise,"" he said.The project is called the AIIMS Cohort Study (ACS), which is being carried out in lines of the Precision Medicine Initiative by the former US President Barack Obama and the Framingham Study. /The idea is to move beyond ""one-size-fits-all"" approach and develop precision medicine that takes into account individual differences in genes, environment and lifestyles, an official said.It is important because there is an emerging evidence of environment playing an important role in rising incidence of stroke - like through air pollution.The initial findings in Vasant Kunj reveal that 70% of the study population suffered from high blood pressure and 40% were diabetic. ""More than 40% men interviewed are smokers. It is a major risk factor for stroke and affects memory as well,"" Dr Prasad, professor and head of neurology at AIIMS, said, adding that before these people were approached, many of them were unaware that they were suffering from hypertension and diabetes.The project took off in 2016 and till date, doctors have analysed the blood pressure of over 7,000 participants who were above 50 years. Blood of 5,445 participants and saliva samples of 1,000 have been stored in Cohort biobank. Serum and plasma samples are stored at 80 degrees Celsius for future bloodbased biomarker assays. DNA isolation of 16 samples is being done daily on a working day. For this, the institute has a facility of 10 rooms where participants' blood samples and other vitals are collected, stored and studied.Stroke happens when blood supply to a part of the brain is cut off, either due to blockage in supply or leakage of blood from a burst vessel in brain (haemorrhagic stroke). Dementia, on the other hand, is not a specific disease. It's an overall term that describes a group of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills severe enough to reduce a person's ability to perform daily activities -alzheimer's accounts for 60%-80% of these cases.There has been a significant increase in stroke cases in the country, which cannot be explained by unhealthy lifestyle and other identified factors alone. ""The role of pollution is also being studied,"" Dr Prasad said. He also stressed on the need to expand the project countrywide for better outcome. The UK, for example, is carrying out a similar study in 22 centres and on five lakh people. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"India tops in under-5 deaths due to toxic air, 60,000 killed in 2016: WHO","NEW DELHI: India's toxic air has been linked to the premature deaths of close to 1,10,000 children in 2016, with the country witnessing highest number of deaths of children under five years of age attributed to their exposure to ambient air pollution of particulate matter (PM) 2.5, said a World Health Organisation (WHO) report released on the eve of the first-ever conference on air pollution and health. As many as 60,987 children of under five years of age in India died because of their exposure to PM 2.5, followed by Nigeria with 47,674 deaths, Pakistan with 21,136 deaths and Democratic Republic of Congo with 12,890 deaths. In India, the death rate for this age bracket is 50.8 per 1,00,000 children with more girls under the age of five dying than boys due to pollution. /About 32,889 girls died, compared to 28,097 boys in 2016, according to the report. Between five and 14 years, India saw the deaths of 4,360 children attributed to ambient air pollution in 2016. Across both these age groups, over 1 lakh children died in India due to both ambient and household pollution of particulate matter 2.5 in 2016. Particulate matter 2.5 or PM 2.5 are fine dust particles in air which are considered highly harmful for health. The report, titled 'Air Pollution and Child Health - Prescribing clean air', seeks to caution against the rising levels of pollution causing growing burden of diseases as well as deaths. Over 2 million deaths occur prematurely in India due to pollution, accounting for 25% of the global deaths due to air pollution. Globally, every day around 93% of children under the age of 15 years (1.8 billion children) breathe air that is so polluted it puts their health and development at serious risk. WHO estimates that in 2016, almost 6,00,000 children died from acute lower respiratory infections caused by polluted air. While in low and middle income countries, 98% of children under five are said to be exposed to PM 2.5, in high income countries, this number is almost half at 52%. The report also highlights adverse impact of pollution on pregnant women and children. Pregnant women, exposed to polluted air, are more likely to give birth prematurely, and have small, low birth-weight children, the report says. ""Air pollution is stunting our children's brains, affecting their health in more ways than we suspected,"" said Dr Maria Neira, director, department of public health, environmental and social determinants of health at WHO.

"Forget paddy, Mohali fails to check burning of leaves too","MOHALI: Where Mohali administration has been stressing on to curb stubble burning in the district, they have ignored the dry leaves burning menace. The practice of burning the dry leaves and garbage dumps has been equally polluting the environment.Residents believe that the extensive efforts of Mohali administration to curb the paddy straw burning is challenging the dry leaves and garbage dump burning which has been ignored by the administration.With air pollution worsening in many parts of the country, Jammu and Kashmir has decided to step up efforts to combat its own worsening air quality.Whereas all the concerned authorities of pollution control are struggling to stop the stubble burning in Punjab, the Mohali administration struggles to curb the dry leaves burning, which can be seen on every nook and corner of the city.Mukesh Kumar Bharwal, a resident of phase VII in Mohali said, ""Government is trying to launch many schemes for farmers to discourage stubble burning, on the other hand municipality contractors are dumping the litter and garbage in open space that also near city's most beautiful and busy YPS roundabout in Mohali Phase 7. Such heaps are put on fire especially early in the morning. A layer of smoke may also be noted in this area in morning time.""Bharwal questioned that 'Why these responsible authorities are not able to control even one contractor working for them?'/ He said, people are coming to leisure valley to have a breath of fresh air in early morning but one illiterate contractor or whosoever he may be is polluting the whole area.It is not only Bharwal making complaints about the dry leaves burning issue in the city but residents from other areas of Sector 70 Mataur village where garbage dump is generally of fire. Gurdeep Singh resident of Sector 70 said, ""We have Mataur village in our sector and a garbage dump near community center is always on fire. Foul smell and milky white smoke regularly pollutes the air and there is no one to check the miscreants.""DC Gurpreet Kaur Sapra has already issued orders of banning the burning of dry leaves in the district but the menace continues with impunity.

Doctors advise people to wear masks,"PATNA: With the air quality in Patna being in the 'poor' category, doctors have advised the residents to use scarves, handkerchief and masks to protect themselves from dust pollution.The Air Quality Index (AQI) released by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Monday showed higher level of air pollution in major towns in Bihar. The AQI in Patna at 4pm was 236, which is categorized as 'poor', while Muzaffarpur and Gaya recorded 113 and 157 AQI respectively, which is in the 'moderate' category.'Poor' category of AQI can lead to breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure and 'moderate' category can cause breathing discomfort with lungs, asthma and heart diseases.Accordingly, doctors and medical experts in the city have advised people to cover their nose while travelling. PMCH medical superintendent Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said, ""The prevailing weather condition and degrading air quality can affect the respiratory system, heart and can stimulate bronchiolitis. /Joggers should avoid going out in the morning in such condition, but if they want, they should put up a mask on their faces.""Dr Ranjan said the present environment is more dangerous for school kids as they breathe in more air per kilogram of their body weight than adults.Physician Dr Rajesh Sinha said masks have been become imperative, especially for morning walkers and school and college-goers. ""The surgical and simple air purifier masks are partially helpful and definitely lower the impact of pollutants. The sub-micron masks do not allow the dust particles to reach the lungs,"" he said, and advised the residents to drink boiled water for healthy immune system.Ashutosh Pandey (32) of Krishnapuri said he stopped jogging as he was feeling uneasy with all the smog. ""Last week, I realized that I got slow and easily tired. I will continue my exercise as soon as I got the sub-micron filters,"" he said.Sathish Suman said walking in Gandhi Maidan has become difficult due to dust particles and smog. ""Rather than feeling healthy, I'll get sick in this condition. It has become impossible to walk without a mask in dust,"" said Suman of Bank Road.Several college-goers and parents of school kids are also taking precautions. Mouni of Kurji, whose daughter studies in Notre Dame Academy, said she covers her daughter's face while dropping her to school. ""Due to construction works around school premises, I put a mask over her face. She recently recovered from cold and I'm taking all the precautions to keep her healthy,"" she said.A shopkeeper near Patna Market said the demand for even of simple mask has increased in the last one week. ""We also stocked up surgical masks and anti-pollution masks. The masks range between Rs50 and Rs450,"" he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Is Bengaluru's polluted air 'breaking' young hearts?,"Vasanth Kumar, 34, is a non-smoker and teetotaler. The autorickshaw driver from Bommanahalli spends nearly 12 hours a day on the roads to provide for his wife and two children. Three months ago, his small world came crashing down.At first, the pain in his left chest was bearable. /With time, it aggravated and one day, he had to be taken to the state-run Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research. There, the doctors gave him some shocking news - he had suffered a heart attack due to blocked arteries.The doctors were as puzzled as Vasant and his family were.""Vasanth is one of the many patients we've seen who have suffered heart attacks with no known risk factors involved,"" says Dr Rahul S Patil, consultant cardiologist and head of project Premature Coronary Artery Disease (PCAD) at the institute. ""We are seeing an increase in the number of young age heart attacks. Air pollution is one of the causes.""Prolonged hours on the road, surrounded by vehicle emissions, impacts the heart, the ongoing study at the institute has found. It covers 2,000 heart patients below 40 years who have been visiting the hospital since April 2017. Over 25% of the patients are either auto drivers or cab drivers, while 65% are from Bengaluru.""I don't drink nor smoke. Even the doctors don't know what may have led to the heart attack,"" says Vasanth. ""I am more cautious these days. But I have returned to work. I am an autorickshaw driver and that's my job. I have to continue working.""Researchers at Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research are charting the frequented routes of these patients and to study the impact, mobile air pollution monitors have to be set up. St John's Research Institute too has joined the study.""We want to understand the effect of traffic and air pollution on the working population travelling in cars,"" says Patil. ""In the studied population, blood is hyper viscous and unable to flow freely through the arteries. We have learned that there is an abnormal fluctuation in their blood pressure and heart rate, which are known to be detrimental to the heart.""Studies across the world have found that air pollutants lead to cardiovascular diseases such as artery blockages leading to heart attacks and death of heart tissue due to oxygen deprivation, leading to permanent heart damage. While it is still being studied exactly how pollutants weaken the heart, scientists say it is similar to how respiratory disease is caused - by inflammation and oxidative stress.

'Bad-air fight can't be Nov-Feb exercise',"New Delhi: Concrete steps, rather than reactions, and awareness among people are needed to help tackle the pollution menace in Delhi, a University of Chicago environment expert said on Monday.""Last year too I was in Delhi around Diwali season. Then, Supreme Court had banned the sale of firecrackers. However, people were very angry. /Why is it just one day? Why are you depriving us of this annual celebration? There is no cohesion between educating the people about the ill effects and policy to eliminate it,"" Dr Christopher Sola Olopade, professor of medicine at the department of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of Chicago, told TOI.Olopade, who has done extensive research on threats of indoor air pollution, says the fight against pollution should be a yearlong process and not a November to February exercise.""New Delhi's air is one of the most polluted in the world, next to Beijing... When you are exposed to such high levels of pollution, it leads to the body developing blood clots and ailments like heart attacks and strokes. However, to really understand the impact, you may need to visit the emergency room in hospitals and see how people are coming down with asthma attacks, obstructive lung disease, premature deliveries and heart attacks,"" he said.According to the expert, the impact of air pollution on pregnant women is quite alarming. ""The data that we have now indicates these children are at a risk of asthma, autism, diabetes and are even predisposed to mental issues. We have looked at placenta of women exposed to pollution during pregnancy, and we saw low oxygen. When babies gestate in this state, it impacts their cognitive development. You are creating a whole generation of people who are going to be disadvantaged.""According to him, overall exposure to indoor air pollution accounts for about three million premature deaths every year globally.Last week, the Central Pollution Control Board's task force advised people in NCR to limit exposure to high level of outdoor pollution and experts in the panel advised against burning incense sticks.""If you take low-cost sensors and put them in a home environment, you will notice high level of particulate matter, CO and volatile organic compounds. People burn incense as that has a spiritual significance. But there is a need for adequate ventilation. The stagnation of air is not good for people's health. It will give you the same adverse impact as you were outside,"" Olopade said.According to the expert, better automobile emission standards, minimising the number of cars coming into Delhi every day, helping farmers in Punjab and Haryana with plausible solutions to stop stubble burning, dust control measures at construction sites and quality control on polluting industries are steps that should help clean the city's air.""When a person has cancer, you won't put a bandage on it.

Rising pollution could hit monsoon rains: UN report,"NAGPUR: Rising air pollution in India is likely to impact rainfall patterns in the country and decrease monsoon in long term, which can cause extensive financial losses, warns a United Nations report released on Tuesday. ""Air Pollution in Asia and the Pacific: Science-based Solutions"" presents a scientific assessment of air pollution in Asia and the Pacific. Released in the World Health Organisation's (WHO) first global conference on air pollution and health in Geneva, the report covers various pollution aspects which India is grappling with. /The largest impact of air pollution on the Indian monsoon will be a decrease in the amount of rainfall, the report warns. ""However, some parts can also witness high precipitation depending on the topography. Pollution will also impact the duration and distribution of rainfall,"" said Nathan Borgford-Parnell, science affairs adviser at Climate and Clean Air Coalition who co-authored the report. The report states that the presence of particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5), a deadly tiny pollutant, can affect precipitation patterns during monsoon in India. ""A weaker trend in the Indian monsoon precipitation has been linked to changes in the emissions of particles and other pollutants from within and outside Asia,"" the report says. The report also has a word of praise for several mitigation measures taken by the government.Recognising indoor air pollution as a major health crisis in India, the report reveals that it is contributing as much as 22-52% to the country's ambient air pollution. Speaking exclusively to TOI, Andy Haines, member of the scientific advisory panel of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, said from Geneva, ""The much-needed mitigation measure that India needs to ensure is provision of clean household energy. Burning of fossil fuels in households is a big health threat, especially for women and children."" UN claims that if the suggested measures are implemented, annual premature mortality associated with indoor air pollution can decline by 75%. This means that about 2 million premature deaths per year can be avoided in countries like India . The economic development data of 41 countries (in Asia and the Pacific) shows that unlike many other nations who managed to control air pollution with economic development, India's air quality got worse with an increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A graph shows as India transitioned from a low-income to a middle-income country between 1995 and 2014, levels of PM 2.5 increased significantly. Haines added that growing air pollution was affecting the country's health care, with an increase in ailments like heart attack, cancer and other respiratory diseases.

"Wind gone, pollution turns worse","GURUGRAM: The city is gearing up for implementation of emergency measures as the air quality index (AQI) again touched the 'severe' mark on Tuesday. The AQI was recorded at 426 on Tuesday, which is so far the highest this season. After Sunday, this was the second day when AQI reached 'severe' level in Gurugram. /The AQI had reached 403 in the city on Sunday whereas on Monday, it was at 389. AQI over 400 is considered to be in the 'severe' category. Meanwhile, the 24-hour average of PM2.5 was recorded at 255.47 micrograms per cubic metre on Tuesday. According to Central Pollution Control Authority (CPCB), 'severe' pollution levels affect healthy people and severely impact those suffering from respiratory diseases.Talking about the reason behind the continuous increase in concentration of particulate matter, an official with Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said, ""As the wind speed is going down, the concentration of particulate matter is rising sharply in the lower atmosphere, leading to an increase in air pollution levels. We have directed all civic authorities to take measures as instructed by Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA). Emergency measures have to be implemented if the air pollution levels remain in the 'severe' category continuously for 48 hours.""Experts, on the other hand, blamed stubble burning for the increase in air pollution in Delhi and NCR. ""It is evident from satellite images provided by NASA that stubble burning is causing air pollution in the region. There is an urgent need to take strict action against farmers who are burning crop residue. Otherwise the situation can get worse in the city,"" said Niranjan Raje, former member of EPCA.EPCA, on Tuesday, called for a ban on all construction activities as well as shutting down of stone crushers and brick kilns in the city from November 1 (Thursday). All industries that use coal and biomass will also remain closed. Moreover, the discom has to ensure uninterrupted power supply to the region in order to bring down use of diesel generator sets. Authorities have also been instructed to increase public transport services and deploy night patrolling teams to keep a check on waste burning and dumping.The air pollution is expected to rise further on Thursday. ""A large number of biomass fire spots have been seen in satellite imageries in the neighbouring states of Delhi in the past 24 hours. The prevailing meteorological conditions, including moderate ventilation index and low wind speed, are also less favourable for dispersal of pollutants in the next two days,"" said the early warning on air quality by CPCB.

Jaggery (Gud) can save you from the harmful air pollution. Read to know how!,"Delhi's air quality is touching a new low with every passing day. The air quality index (AQI) of the national capital was observed to be 367 last Monday, indicating an increase in the PM 2.5--which are particles in the air with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres. For the uninitiated, the AQI of 367 indicates 'very poor' quality of air, while an AQI between 0 and 50 is said to be ""good.""So, if you are experiencing dryness in your throat and difficulty breathing, there is a solution right there in the comfort of your home which will help you combat the harmful effects of toxic air pollutants. /Do you remember how our grandparents used to have a bite of gud (jaggery) after their dinner? Turns out there is a good reason for the same. Gud (jaggery) is unrefined sugar in its purest form, which is obtained from raw sugarcane juice. While the benefits of good old jaggery have been known since time immemorial, you may not be aware of the fact that this natural sweetener can also help you fight the side-effects of the toxic air that you are breathing. According to research conducted by Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, industrial workers who consumed jaggery while working in dusty and smoky environments seemed to experience no discomfort. This happens because jaggery is an excellent natural cleansing agent that helps in flushing out toxins from your body. It also contains anti-allergic properties that make it an excellent remedy for asthma and other respiratory diseases. It is to be kept in mind that the darker the colour of jaggery, the healthier it is for you. Also, avoid gud with a yellow tinge as it may indicate that it is chemically treated. If you are experiencing discomfort in breathing, mix some jaggery with 1 tablespoon of butter and 5 tablespoons turmeric. Having this concoction 3 to 4 times a day will help in relieving the symptoms. But do keep in mind that jaggery should be consumed in moderation (limiting it to maximum four grams a day) and one way to do so is replacing sugar with jaggery in your morning tea.

UN lists 25 measures to combat air pollution; here are some easy steps you can follow,"The air around us is getting toxic every day and it's getting difficult to breathe. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is dipping to dangerous levels and with Diwali around the corner, it is only going to get worse. However, the issue of air pollution is not just limited to India. /According to a report by WHO, about 4 billion people - 92 per cent of Asia and the Pacific's population - are exposed to levels of air pollution that pose a significant risk to their health. Air pollution leaves behind smoke, soot, dust and sulfur oxides which is very hazardous for good health. The overall air quality in Delhi, recorded this week touch the 390 mark. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"".Keeping in mind the issue, the United Nations (UN) recently shared some effective ways to battle air pollution. If followed, the steps could actually help wipe out any trace of air pollution and promote healthy air till 2025.According to the report, effectively implementing the 25 measures would result in a 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide and a 45 percent reduction in methane emissions, preventing up to a third of a degree Celsius in global warming.Here are some steps to keep in check and stay safe:- Wear a pollution mask at all timesWith this weather, having a pollution mask on you is the safest bet you can make in this weather. A good idea would be to chose the one which filters out pollutants like N95/99.- Stay insideWhen the AQI dips further and in times of heavy smog blanketing the city, it is advised to stay inside, especially for children and elderly, who are at a greater risk of contracting respiratory diseases.-Increase the green coverIt is always a better option to stay in a green cover. In order to detoxify the home, use indoor houseplants to increase the intake of oxygen. Some common plants which can improve air quality include aloe vera, orange, neem and peepal.-Chose public transportChoosing a metro ride over car can decongest the traffic and also lower pollution levels greatly. -DetoxIndulging in detox drinks is not just a good idea to relieve yourself of the festive binging but also gets rid of the toxins from the body in an easy way. As a measure, increase your intake of Vitamin C and other protein-rich foods which boost your immunity. Having tulsi and ginger is also a good option. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

For the better functioning of our lungs we should focus on Vitamin E, Omega 3, phytoestrogen and antioxidant rich foods. A simple home remedy can be a concoction of these nutrients in the form of broccoli tomato broth with seasoning of olive oil on it.Dr Priyanka shares three effective home remedies that are easy to make and useful in combating air pollution.Home remedy 1Boil one glass of water and add 5-6 tulsi leaves, grated ginger (one inch) and a small piece of crushed gur (jaggery) to it. Let the mixture boil for 5 minutes and consume it warm. This concoction will help boost immunity. Home remedy 2A glass of water boiled with tulsi leaves, salt, lemon and honey in it can help clear congestion and thus allow you to breathe better. Home remedy 3Haldi milk is beneficial for kids and adults alike. To prepare haldi milk, take a glass of milk and add few drops of ghee, a small piece of ginger, black cardamom, tulsi leaves, 1 clove and a pinch of haldi to it. Let it boil for 4-5 minutes and then add honey after turning off the flame. Consume it warm. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Pollution up sharply as haze sets in, both mercury and visibility will drop","GURUGRAM: The city's pollution level spiked sharply on Monday as a thick haze engulfed the national capital region (NCR) ahead of Diwali owing to stubble burning, pushing the air quality to the 'very poor' category, the authorities said. Gurugram recorded more than 50% increase in the air quality index (AQI) on Monday even though the pollution level in the city remained better than other NCR cities.While the AQI was recorded at 325 (very poor) in Gurugram, other NCR cities reported 'severe' air pollution levels. On Monday, the AQI was recorded at 426 in Delhi, 421 in Faridabad, 435 in Ghaziabad, 433 in Noida and 425 in Greater Noida. /According to the data collected by the Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Gurugram was the ""least-polluted city"" in the region on Monday. Gurugram's AQI was recorded at 206 (poor) on Sunday.Track the pollution level in your city""There is a slight change in the wind direction, and the wind speed in Gurugram is better than other NCR cities,"" said a CPCB official.According to SAFAR's forecast, the AQI levels are going to stay between 310 and 360 (very poor) in the next three days. ""The pollution levels in the city might not go to the 'severe' level as the wind direction has changed. Moreover, most measures under the graded response action plan (GRAP) have been implemented, making the situation better in the city,"" said an official of state pollution body HSPCB.The Met department, on the other hand, said a blanket of fog would envelope Gurugram, and the temperature would drop in the next three days owing to north-westerly winds coming from J&K and Himachal Pradesh.""Fog is expected to bring mercury further down in the morning, and the visibility will stay at 500 metres while 1,000 metres is considered ideal,"" said an official of the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre. He also predicted a decline in minimum temperature in the coming days. ""Till Sunday, we had south easterly winds coming here. Now, the wind direction has changed, and we have north westerly winds coming. Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh witnessed fresh snowfall recently. So, the minimum temperature in the city would dip further,"" the official said.Talking about the forecast for next two-three days, the Met official said, ""In the morning, cold conditions will intensify owing to fog for the next two to three days. By afternoon, it will turn into smog due to an increase in pollutant levels."" The wind speed is expected to stay around 15 km per hour in the coming days.On Monday, the maximum temperature in the city was recorded at 28C while minimum temperature came down to 13C. A further dip in the minimum temperature is expected on Tuesday.According to the forecast system, the contribution of crop stubble burning, however, is likely to go down in the coming days, which may provide some respite. The forecast model showed stubble burning's contribution go down to 14% on Tuesday, 9% on Wednesday - Diwali day - and 10% on Thursday. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Delhi records season's worst air quality in run-up to festival of lights,"NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded its worst air quality of the season on Monday, with the pollution levels inching towards 'severe plus emergency' category due to a change in wind direction and rampant stubble burning in neighbouring states. The PM2.5 (particles in the air with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres) and PM10 concentrations touched 365 and 503 respectively, touching the 'severe-plus emergency' category, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.Track the pollution level in your cityPM2.5 levels above 300 and PM10 levels above 430 are considered ""severe-plus emergency"" category.In NCR, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida recorded ""severe"" pollution levels while Gurgaon recorded ""very poor"" air quality, CPCB data showed.Officials attributed the sudden deterioration in the air quality to a change in wind direction, which is now blowing from the northwestern region towards Delhi and bringing dust and smoke from stubble burning in neighbouring states with it.Delhi's overall air quality index on Monday was recorded at 434, which falls in the ""severe"" category, a drastic decline from Sunday's ""moderate"" level at 171.On Sunday, Delhiites breathed the cleanest air in three weeks, according to CPCB data.The national capital woke up to a thick haze on Monday morning, two days ahead of Diwali, following which, experts have warned, the air quality is likely to worsen further due to local factors. /CPCB chairman S P Singh Parihar said the deterioration of the air quality will continue till Tuesday morning.""But the good news is that speed of surface wind has improved, which may help in dispersing the pollutants,"" he said.An official of the Centre-run System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research said intensified stubble burning is contributing nearly 24 per cent of the air pollution in Delhi.Another official said if the air quality continues to remain in the ""severe"" category for 48 hours, they would consider implementing more regulations.The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology said biomass burning is also contributing to the spike in PM2.5 concentration.

Study: Traffic cops suffer from respiratory diseases,"PATNA: Traffic cops, who are responsible for maintaining smooth flow of vehicles, are the most affected by the city's air pollution. They are more susceptible to lung and respiratory diseases like chronic cough, shortness of breath and wheezing than others.With a strength of 700 personnel, the Patna traffic police have to manage the movement of lakhs of vehicles on a daily basis. /""Many of my colleagues are suffering from respiratory problems. We stay at a designated place for prolonged periods and breathe in toxic air,"" said a woman traffic constable, who was on duty on Bailey Road on Monday.A study, conducted by Paras-HMRI in Patna from May to August this year, revealed that one among four traffic cops had respiratory problems and high blood pressure. At least 191 traffic personnel were screened for the purpose.""Nearly 25% traffic cops were suffering from respiratory and lung diseases and showed symptoms like shortness of breath, wheezing and chronic cough. Over 50% of them had high blood pressure,"" said Dr Talat Halim, regional director (east) of Paras-HMRI hospital.According to officiating traffic SP Ajay Pandey, ""It is not surprising that traffic cops are the worst victims of pollution as they breathe in heavily polluted air for long hours.""Asked about the facilities that are given to the cops, Pandey claimed, ""We conduct their medical check-up at regular intervals and encourage them to wear masks. We also ask them to exercise in order to stay fit.""A woman traffic cop at the Dak Bungalow roundabout told this reporter, ""The masks we wear are not of good quality. We want better ones.""

A 'guarded' Diwali with firecrackers,"JAIPUR: In Delhi, bursting of firecrackers will be allowed from 8 pm to 10 pm, however, in Jaipur the rules are little relaxed during Diwali. District administration issued orders on Tuesday informing that there will be a ban on use of crackers from 10 pm to 6 am. Apart from eight hours ban, Jaipurites will be allowed for bursting firecrackers for 16 hours. /However, the permission is granted for bursting firecrackers that do not emit sound above the permissible decibel levels. Additional district magistrate (Jaipur-South) Dhara Singh Meena said, ""The crackers only produce noise pollution but also they produce air pollution too. There will be a ban on crackers from 10 pm to 6 am."" A control room has also been set up at district collectorate for taking prompt measures in case of fire during Diwali celebrations. District collector Siddharth Mahajan said that control room had been set up at room number 7. It will function in three different shifts. Sawai Man Singh Hospital will deploy extra team of doctors round-the-clock who are specialist in trauma and surgery. Doctors advised patients suffering from respiratory diseases to remain indoors to keep them safe from harmful crackers.""While everyone can be affected by air pollution, people with known respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis, interstitial lung diseases, cardiovascular disease and small children are more susceptible to the side effects of pollutants emitted by crackers. Pregnant women and older adults are also more likely to be affected by air pollution,"" said Dr Narendra Khippal, professor, Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Sawai Man Singh medical college Jaipur. He pointed out that air pollution is affecting the entire body, not just lungs. Lungs have become a point of entry through which the system is getting infected. The number of people complaining about respiratory illness is increasing every year.""A typical cigarette can generate 140ug/m3 (micrograms per cubic meter) of PM 2.5 of certain pollutant in normal room, on the contrary firecrackers can generate 20 - 200 times of toxic pollutant in same closed environment. One anar (flower pot) - generates 4800 ug/m3 equivalent to 30 cigarettes, one chakri (ground spinner) - generates 9500 ug/m 3 units equivalent to 60 cigarettes, one fuljhari (sparklers) generates 10,000 ug/m3 equivalent to 70 cigarettes, one garland of thousand crackers (laddi) - generate 38,500 ug/m3 units equivalent to 270 cigarettes,"" said Dr Khippal.

Air pollution in Patna worst on eve of Diwali,"PATNA: Tuesday turned out to be the most polluted day in Patna this season with air quality plunging to 'very poor' category a day before Diwali. The Air Quality Index (AQI) read 334 as thick haze of dust enveloped the state capital. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) stipulates that ""very poor"" category of air can lead to respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. /Experts at Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) attributed the thick haze to a combination of meteorological and man-made factors. Apart from Patna, air quality also worsened in Gaya and Muzaffarpur as well.The AQI released by CPCB for Patna stood at 307 and 318, which remained in 'very poor' category. The AQI in 0-50 range is considered good, 50-100 as satisfactory, 101-200 as moderate, 201-300 as poor, 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe.Experts cautioned that such situation would prevail in Patna, Gaya and Muzaffarpur even a day after Diwali.S N Jaiswal, senior scientist at Bihar State Pollution Control Board, said: ""Vehicular emission and dust emanating from damaged roads and construction activities are responsible for the high level of air pollution in Patna and some other cities in Bihar.""Deliberating on the measures to curb air pollution, Jaiswal said: ""We request people not to burn waste in the open. The construction sites should be covered and people should reduce their dependence on private vehicles.""According to Sameer app of CPCB, the average level of pollutants such as PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) in Patna at 2.30pm on Tuesday were 166, 129 and 68 microgram per cubic metre, respectively.As per National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the standard level of PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide should be 60 and 80 microgram per cubic metre per day. The level of carbon monoxide should be under 4 microgram per cubic metre per hour.PMCH superintendent Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said: ""Due to high level of air pollution in Patna, we advise people to avoid prolonged exposure in the heavily polluted air.

""People burst crackers in a controlled way. /None has been booked so far for violation of SC order,"" Maharaaj added.The SSP's claim notwithstanding, loud bangs rent the air in the city much beyond the two-hour timeframe prescribed by the apex court as people celebrated Diwali on Wednesday night. Smoke from the firecrackers troubled law-abiding people, who were expecting some relief from noise pollution this year.Localities like Phulwarisharif, Ashok Rajpath, Pataliputra, Danapur, Patna City, Anisabad and Fraser Road witnessed fireworks till midnight. Foul smell left by firecrackers could be felt across the city on Thursday as well.""The SC's order has gone up in smoke. Those who violated the restrictions should feel ashamed as they have put the lives of senior citizens and toddlers, who are vulnerable to air pollution, at risk,"" said Anita Sinha, 42, a resident of Pataliputra.However, there are some who feel firecrackers are not solely responsible for deteriorating air quality in the city.

Air pollution: How to tell smog from fog,"Post-Diwali, we are seeing a relapse of the toxic air that surrounds the city every year. The Air Quality Index has further dipped down making the air we breathe worse and living conditions borderline dangerous, especially for kids and old people. The air we are breathing is equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day!/ But it can be hard to differentiate if it is the usual fog that engulfs the city with the winter winds or smog, which is forcing people to stay indoors!So is it smog or fog?This is one question that makes everybody confused. We keep hearing about air pollution but once you go outside, you might feel see a hazy layer outside but feel it's just the onset of winter chill that is making you cough. We help you find out the difference, especially when the Air Quality is crossing high levels! Though they look the same, smog and fog are formed quite differently.Smog vs fogIn simple terms, what makes fog different from deadly smog is the smoke. While fog can cause similar breathing problems in people, smog is more dangerous as it fills the lungs with cancer-causing carcinogens which are difficult to even flush out once settled in. Fog is formed when the water vapour in the air condenses and the resulting water droplets just stay in the air, engulfing the air with a whitish layer what we know as fog. This also reduces visibility.Smog is a combination of fog and smoke. High levels of hazardous gases like sulphur dioxide, soot and benzene, which form smoke react with the fog to form chemical compounds that form smog. Most of these smog-causing compounds come from factories, crop burning and other polluting power plants where poisonous gases like sulphur dioxide are regularly used and released. Smog also has the ability to worsen with lower temperatures, something which is bound to happen with the onset of winters. The deadly smog can cause eye irritation, coughing, difficulty breathing, congestion and other respiratory problems. Unlike fog, you can actually smell the smog and know the difference!While fog is whiter in colour, the air we see around us has tones of grey, which the scientists term as smog and not fog. While fog eventually dips down, smog persists in the air and transfers smoke-like particles which we end up ingesting.So yes, it is not just the regular winter onset that is causing cold and cough and other breathing problems. There are pollutants in the air which are making you sick. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Several people in Patna complained that they woke up to burning sensations in eyes and irritation in nose and throat on Thursday.Dr Chandra Shekhar, superintendent at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital-Patna, said, ""Severe level of air pollution may lead to respiratory problems, such as chronic cough, wheezing and breathlessness. Senior citizens and toddlers are especially vulnerable to breathing troubles. Heavily polluted air can also lead to irritation and watering in eyes. People should use masks and plane glasses to protect themselves from the harmful impacts of foul air.""BSPCB chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh, on the other hand, attributed higher level of air pollution to extensive fireworks on Diwali night. ""We had expected lesser fireworks, but it did not happen probably due to unavailability of green crackers. However, the sudden worsening of air quality is only temporary as the pollutants are likely to disperse from the air within 48 hours,"" Ghosh said.Asked about measures to control air pollution, Ghosh said, ""As there is no machine-based resolution of air pollution, it can only be dealt by increasing awareness among people. People's participation is necessary to curb pollution."" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'AQI likely to get better after 48 hours',"PATNA: The state capital witnessed a sharp rise in the air pollution level with a surge in the Air Quality Index (AQI) on Diwali on Wednesday.According to Sameer app of the Central Pollution Control Board (CBPCB), the AQI increased from 373 at 4pm on Wednesday to 420 at 8am on Thursday, which falls under the 'severe' category. It can badly affect healthy people and those with existing diseases.The CPCB stated that Patna's AQI was 334 on the eve of Diwali on Tuesday. The worsening of air quality began on Wednesday with large-scale bursting of firecrackers and other meteorological conditions.Despite the Supreme Court's restrictions on bursting of crackers from 8pm to 10pm this Diwali, the AQI was 373 at 4pm on Wednesday and 388 at 11pm, an hour after the end of the two-hour window.Experts claimed that meteorological factors such as drop in temperature, increase in moisture and decline in wind speed also formed favourable conditions for trapping of pollutants in Patna's air.""The temperature dropped to 17 degrees C at 11pm on Wednesday, while the humidity was 84% that led to an increase in moisture and trapping of pollutants. /The wind, which was blowing at a speed of 8km per hour on Tuesday became calm. These factors made the dispersal of pollutants more difficult,"" said a duty officer at the Patna Meteorological Centre.He added, ""Meteorological factors played a secondary role in Patna's air pollution on Diwali. The primary role was played by large-scale bursting of firecrackers.""Bihar State Pollution Control Board's senior scientist S N Jaiswal claimed, ""As per our assessment, the concentration of pollutants will take at least 48 hours to disperse.""
