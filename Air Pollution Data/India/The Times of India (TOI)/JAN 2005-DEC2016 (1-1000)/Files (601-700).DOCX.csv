Masks don't shield us against foul air,"BENGALURU: For Sarmila Karmakar, wearing a dupatta is not just a style statement; it comes handy as a protective gear whenever she steps out. The threat of inhaling dust prompts her to create a balaclava (a form of cloth headgear) out of her cotton dupatta, especially when she rides a two-wheeler. ""I believe it saves my skin from tanning and shields me from pollution to an extent,"" Sarmila says./Tushar Thapa, a college student from Electronics City, recently started using a mask while riding to his college. ""I am a native of Uttarakhand. I have been suffering from cold and allergies for almost six months after coming to Bengaluru. Wearing a mask helps, but it turns black in a week,"" he says. But the truth is masks and dupattas don't protect people from pollutants, says experts./The mask that Tushar Thapa uses is available in local drugstores. Both Sarmila and Tushar are under the impression that they protect themselves from noxious gases at busy traffic intersections they pass through every day. But the reality is different, say experts./Bengalureans, mostly twowheeler riders, use sterilized, surgical masks available at pharmacies. Most women depend on thin scarves or dupattas. But in a city where air pollution continues to spiral upward, wearing masks available in the market is not effective enough./Whitefield and Silk Board Junction recorded a rise of more than 200% of residual suspended particulate matter (RSPM) of 2.5 microns in the air. Last year, RSPM in these areas rose by 213% and 203%, respectively, compared to 2014. The reason: Vehicular emissions. Both places are extremely congested. Silk Board is the gateway to the IT corridors of Marathahalli, Whitefield and Sarjapur in one direction and Electronics City on the other./USE MASKS WITH HEPA FILTERS/Says Dr H Paramesh, paediatric pulmonologist: ""Ozone at the ground level is released from vehicle emissions. It causes asthma and respiratory problems and has a cumulative effect on the body too. Formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds cannot be filtered by simple surgical masks that people usually use. There should be minimum of two layers of filters in a mask to prevent particulate matter and gases to a maximum extent. These can be filtered by masks having High-Efficiency Particulate-Arresting (HEPA) capacity. HEPA filters are used in vaccum cleaners and air cleaners."" HEPA filters can restrict RSPM of diameter of less than 0.5 microns. But air cleaners having HEPA filters follow the US Department of Energy (DoE) standards and there are no such standards for HEPA filters in India. ""Pollution levels in India are higher than in the US. HEPA can be used indoors,"" he adds./Dr Vivek Anand Padegal, director, chest diseases, Fortis Hospitals, says the right kind of mask is yet to be developed in India. ""Masks with HEPA filters are not just difficult to wear while driving, but hardly prevent gases like carbon monoxide, ozone and oxides of nitrogen and sulphur.These are mostly used by industrial workers and painters, but are hardly seen in India.Perhaps helmet manufacturers should make headgear having thin layers of HEPA filters; riders can use a double-layered cotton mask for protection,"" he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Mumbaikars have older lungs for their age, say doctors","Mumbai: A haze, a temporary atmospheric phenomenon, isn't supposed to be so dangerous that local people should fear to walk or work on those days, but what happens when poisonous gases continue to pollute the air 365 days a year?/A study published in the Economic and Political Weekly last year put a number to this tragedy: Excess pollution has reduced the life expectancy of 660 million Indians (who live in areas with higher than normal concentration of PM2.5) by 3.2 years on an average. Put differently, curbing air pollution could help pollution-affected Indian residents gain an additional 3.2 years of life./There is more. A projection worked out by German Max Planck institute in September 2015 suggested that ""Kolkata will record 54,800 deaths due to air pollution in 2050-more than Delhi, which will record 52,000 deaths, and Mumbai with 33,100 deaths during the same year.""/There is, of course, an immediate price to pay for elevated pollution levels. ""Every time pollution levels increase, people with sensitive airways suffer from breathlessness or worsening of symptoms (for instance, asthma),"" said chest specialist Dr Ashok Mahasur who was a part of the first 'Urban Air Quality Strategy in Asia' study in the early nineties. The long-term effect on Mumbai's population is now being recorded. ""While calculating lung age of people, we find that Mumbaikars have older lungs for their age,"" said Dr Mahasur./Dr S R Kamat, chest specialist who set up the BMC-run KEM Hospital's Environment Pollution Research Centre, said levels of PM2.5 have risen to worrying levels. Doctors along eastern suburbs, which has been witnessing a spurt in pollutants, partially due to illegal burning of garbage in the Deonar dumpyard, have been receiving a rising number of complaints of sore throat, watery eyes and allergies. ""It is well-known that air and its pollutants from Deonar blow towards Mankhurd in the first half of the day. In the evening, the winds dumpyard blow towards Ghatkopar,"" said Dr Kamat. In fact, pollutants from Deonar are known to reach Bhandup as well./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Madurai's dust pollution due to unclean roads, alarmingly high","Madurai: Although the Madurai Corporation has spent nearly a crore on the purchase of road sweeping machines, roads in the city continue to remain dusty. According to environmentalists, dust particles are causing a spike in air pollution levels in the city./Environmental consultant, S Rajamohan, says dusty roads are the main reason for high particulate levels in city's air. The permissible level for PM2.5 pollutants is 40 mg/m3, but Rajamohan says it is four or five times higher in places like Kaalavasal, Arapalayam, Palanganatham, Arasaradi and Kamarajar Salai./Kamarajar Salai, which includes the area around Mariamman teppakulam where the float festival was conducted recently, is one of the most polluted in the city. Similarly, the permissible level for PM10 is 60 mg/m3 but it is more than 200 mg/m3 at many places./Particulate matter in the air is defined in two categories: PM10 refers to particles less than 10 micrometres in diameter and PM2.5 refers to those less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter./PM2.5 particles also known as 'fine particles' are believed to pose the greatest health risks./""Dust rises to a height of about 10 to 15 feet and then settles down. If the roads are cleaned regularly, air pollution can be controlled,"" says Rajamohan. However, the levels of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide, the other major pollutants, are within permissible limits, he adds./Consultant pulmonologist at the Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre, Dr G Velkumar, says that there has been a 10 to 15% rise in the number of people who are non-smokers and without any history of allergy, suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) compared to 10 years back. ""Due to dust in the air, non-smokers and those without any family history of lung ailments have 30% less lung capacity compared to their European counterparts,"" says Dr Velkumar./CPI(M) councillor C Chellammal says that the machines have not been properly utilised. ""First they introduced the machines. Then they started the Amma Scheme to employ women to sweep the roads. Most of them are aged women, who can't even walk a few feet and also refuse to clean the storm water drains. It is just another corruptive scheme,"" she alleged./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Trash smoke chokes Wagholi,"Pune: Wagholi, a growing residential area on the fringes of the city, is battling an urban problem-- garbage accumulation, no system to dispose it of and people setting the collected mounds on fire. The open burning is sending thick, black smoke into the air and choking the elderly and children./Almost a year after TOI had highlighted the problem, residents continue to complain about round-the-clock black, sooty smoke enveloping the entire area around Wagheshwar temple./The thick smoke makes it difficult to breathe even indoors, clothes become dirty and smelly within hours of stepping out of home and the A sum total of all these shortcomings is forcing many to shift to other areas./Though Wagholi epitomizes the challenges of urban waste disposal, it's a harsh reality confronting most of the city's fringe areas. The realtors continue to promote plush and budget homes in new and upcoming locations, but the absence of basic infrastructure in these pockets-some still under gram panchayats-mean that life just outside their fancy homes is still a struggle for basic necessities like water, roads, and, in case of Wagholi, a garbage disposal facility./The people living in newly developed residential high-rises in areas around Gore Vasti in Wagholi say that garbage is burnt 24x7 on an open plot behind Wagheshwar temple. The residents of nearby societies like Splendour Park, Splendour County, Ozone Apartments and Ozone Villa say they find it is difficult to step out of their homes./Jaya Sharma, a resident of Ozone Apartments since November 2011, said, ""We have forgotten what fresh air means because we are surrounded by black smoke all through the day and night. Our clothes turn sooty and smelly, children don't go out to play and elderly can't take a walk without inhaling the dangerously polluted air. The problem has aggravated in the last few months. Many new tenants of our society, in fact, moved out after just a couple of months. We too have considered shifting elsewhere but are staying back since we own the house.""/Richa Agrawal, another local, said that one needs to pay attention to increasing health problems faced by residents. ""Many suffer from difficulty in breathing and perpetual cough. Asthmatics and elderly too are suffering because of the polluted air. I have been staying in this area since 2011, but the problem has aggravated in the last two years,"" she said./Ela Agarwal said her son accidentally left the window open and in a short time their house was filled with black smoke. ""This area has now evolved from a village into an urban area, so rules too should be changed accordingly, especially with regards to garbage disposal. We inhale the smoke day and night,"" she added./Merging with Pune Municipal Corporation will not immediately address the problem, said Gajanan Panchal, chairman of Splendour County society./""We are aware of a proposal that suggests inclusion of Wagholi in Pune city. However, the official procedure will take time. For now, the gram panchayat can at least consider changing the location of dumping and burning garbage which includes wet and dry waste from not only village areas, but also residential societies and restaurants,"" Panchal said./Wagholi's village development officer Madhukar Date said, ""Flat buyers should have considered these aspects before investing in a house in this area. This is the story of all rural areas around Pune. Nobody allows outsiders to come and dump garbage in their area, even on the ouskirts. We have no other plot to dump and dispose of garbage and no manpower even to sort it as dry or wet. Setting up a sewage treatment plant will involve expenditure of at least Rs 12 crore and we don't have that kind of money in our reserve. However, we are in talks with the Pune Municipal Corporation and an NGO to help us solve this problem. Hopefully, we will have a breakthrough in the next couple of months.""/Officials of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), including regional officers and those in-charge of Wagholi area, were unavailable for comment./Battle for clean air/Statistics from Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) data said the city's air pollution has increased by 35.7% since 2010. Smoke from garbage is just one factor. The percentage of pollutants in the air from vehicular emission has increased manifold as compared to that from other sources. A poor monsoon last year and below normal minimum temperatures are also responsible for poor air quality in the city of late. When the air quality is poor, people with heart or lung diseases, older adults and children should not exert themselves. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis recently said the state government, under the Smart Cities' Mission, had undertaken a citizens' survey on the priorities, and found that everywhere, it was safety and sanitation. They needed roads and infrastructure but the priority has been a clean and safe city, he said./Bad for the lungs/Garbage smoke ruins health. Pune has had to battle fires at its garbage depot in Uruli Devachi. Each time there is a blaze, villagers have had to endure the huge clouds of smoke emanating from the dump. Similarly, thick smoke continued to cover parts of Chembur, Wadala and Ghatkopar in Mumbai because of a fire that broke out at the 132-acre Deonar dumping ground on Thursday. Citizens said the dense smoke was causing extreme irritation to their eyes and breathing problems. Municipal and private schools located in nearby areas have declared a holiday on Saturday for their students due to the dense smoke./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Expert tips to deal with choking air pollution,"The city has been enveloped in a heavy layer of smog caused by a fire last week at the Deonar dumping ground. It released hazardous gases into the air, raising the pollution levels to a dangerous point and is causing breathing difficulties.

""The predominant sources of outdoor air pollution are transportation, power generation, industrial and agricultural emissions, and residential heating and cooking,"" the IARC stated./According to Dr Nitesh Rohtagi, a senior medical oncologist at Max hospital in Saket, persons suffering from cough for more than three weeks, or prolonged pain in chest or bone, should see a doctor immediately. ""Smoking still causes nearly 80% of all lung cancers. Smokers should quit the habit to reduce the risk for themselves and their families since passive smoking can also cause the disease,"" he said./""Outdoor air pollution, meanwhile, increases the risk of cancer for us all. The South East Asia Region has 14 of the world's top 20 polluted cities, making clear the need for governments to tackle the issue with a sense of urgency,"" said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for Southeast Asia on the eve of World Cancer Day./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Kolshet residents see red as toxic fumes choke area,"Thane: After the Deonar dumping ground incident in Mumbai a few days ago, residents of Kolshet have started complaining of air pollution allegedly due to burning of electronic waste in the area by scrap dealers from Mumbai. Sources claim that the cartel that used to operate around Deonar dump yard have now shifted to the lake city as vigilance has been stepped up in Mumbai following the recent fire incident./The scrap dealers, it has been learnt, burn the waste to extract copper. They choose this method as the other mechanized process is apparently time consuming and costly./Residents from neighbouring complexes have been complaining of breathlessness and respiratory ailments since the last few weeks. Some residents carried out an inspection during which they found burning plastic waste./Residents have been complaining about smoke in the area but had never known the reason for it. Recently, they discovered what was actually going on here. Some of them also asked nearby traders as to who was burning these waste in the area./On quizzing, the traders said that scrap dealers used to burn electronic waste to extract copper. They also hinted at some of the dealers being from Mumbai./""We were surprised that almost every night the certain pockets along Kolshet road and its adjoining areas were enveloped with smoke. The smoke used to subside by morning. We spoke to a few vendors who then told us about the activities that go on late at night. The scrap dealers, some from Mumbai, carry out such activities where they burn wires and electronic waste throughout the night. This illegal activity has been adding to the air pollution in the area,'' said one of the residents./Another resident, too, echoed the same views and complained of pungent smell emanating in the area at night. However, the smoke and smell subsides by day break./The residents are now planning to approach the local authorities and apprise them of the situation./Corporator Madhukar Pavshe said that he is aware of the issue and has also recently complained to the corporation./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"UP, Bihar, Bengal see more fog than Delhi","When it comes to fog in north India, the large number of flight cancellations helps keep the spotlight firmly on New Delhi. But a new study suggests that the national capital region may not be the area most affected by the phenomenon./The frequency of fog occurrences has increased in the past 15 years in the eastern parts of the Indo-Gangetic plain - including eastern UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Bangladesh, as well as the Nepal Terai - but not in the western parts including Delhi, according to a satellite data analysis by IIT-Bombay researchers led by Ritesh Gautam. The new findings are surprising because previous research has shown an increase in fog frequency over Delhi and around linked to a rise in humidity and pollution./By contrast the new study, which was presented at the American Geophysical Union conference in December, found high year-to-year variability in fog occurrence over the Delhi region -- linked to variability in weather conditions -- but no long-term rise in the past decade-and-a-half.Gautam, an assistant professor at IIT's centre of studies in resources engineering and climate studies, said the divergence could be because most other studies have relied on visibility measurements./""When the visibility falls to less than one km, it is classified as fog,"" he said. ""But it might just be polluted haze.""/Satellite data has its own limitations. But Gautam said that the team had also found corroborative trends in surface data from 2000-2015./The increase in fog over the eastern region coincided with a rise in pollution, the IIT analysis also found. Other studies have also shown a link between increasing winter- time pollution and fogginess. Pollution particles, especially those known as aerosols, attract water vapour, promoting the formation of fog droplets./In this case, Gautam suggested that the westerlies - winds flowing from northwest of India - transport pollution eastwards, leading to an accumulation over the eastern Indo-Gangetic plain./The findings point to the need for broadening fog study beyond the capital region, Gautam said. ""Although most of north India experiences fog and pollution in winter, the focus is mostly on Delhi,"" said the former Nasa researcher. ""There should be increased focus over both urban and rural locations in northern India.""/Interestingly, a previous study by Gautam's team found holes in the fog cover over Delhi and other cities. This could be due to higher temperatures from urban heat islands, the study suggested - highlighting the variety of factors involved in fog formation./These studies stem from IIT-Bombay's Fog South Asia initiative (fogsouthasia.com), a satellite monitoring system for fog detection being developed to aid the government in forecasting and transport management./The initiative is part of a slew of new efforts to decipher an important yet understudied phenomenon in South Asia, including the role played by air pollution./In December, the Indian Meteorological Department and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology started a five-year study of fog in Delhi. The same month, a regional fog study was launched by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), an intergovernmental think-tank based in Kathmandu. The project is being conducted with the collaboration of scientists across India, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh./""The issue of fog is such that it cannot be studied locally and thus needs regional cooperation,"" said Bhupesh Adhikary, air quality specialist at ICIMOD./The project involves collecting pollution and meteorology data in various locations along with satellite-based data, to understand the chemical science. ""At the same time, we are also collecting data in small villages to try to understand the social dimension,"" Adhikary said./While there is no scientific evidence yet about fog in the Nepal Terai, the public perception is that fog is getting more intense and lasts longer, he added.Historically, most fog research has been done in Europe and America. ""Chemically speaking, there is a big difference in the character of South Asian fog,"" said Vinayak Sinha, assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research at Mohali.That character is shaped by topographical and environmental conditions particular to this region, he noted, including the pollutant mix. Desert dust and emissions from the burning of crop residues were never a factor in, say, Victorian London's polluted fogs.""Existing forecasting models are from the US and don't show us the entire picture,"" said Sachin Ghude, the IIT-M coordinator for the Delhi campaign, which plans to collaborate with IIT-Bombay. ""The goal,"" he said, ""is to improve our understanding and fine-tune our models.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Kolkata chokes on exhaust fumes,"Survey in central business district shows 20% of population at high risk/Around 20% of those exposed to open air conditions in the city's central business district (CBD) are at high risk of lung diseases, revealed a study conducted by a private hospital./""Air pollution in the form of vehicular emission or fuel combustion in densely populated urban areas is a major source of suspended particulate matter in air. This is a high risk factor for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases,"" the report states, referring to similar findings by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2005./Angshuman Mukherjee, Sanjit Ray Chaudhuri and Raja Dhar from Fortis Hospital, along with Sangeeta Deogawanka from the Rajputana Society of Natural History, conducted the survey titled 'Relationship between air pollution and human health focusing on particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10)' in Dalhausie, Esplanade, B B Ganguly Street, parts of CR Avenue, Park Street and Rabindra Sarovar./Dhar, who is a consultant pulmonologist and expert on respiratory diseases, said: ""The direct effect of air pollution on human health has been questioned. It was found that air pollution has indirectly raised the hospital admission rates, as well as cost of treatment. In this particular survey, the relationship between air pollution and human health, focusing on using a single component of air pollution (PM10), has been studied. We have used the spatial variability of this component, taking Kolkata as a case study.""/Onsite spirometry tests (it measures the volume and speed of air movement out of lungs) were conducted on 130 roadside vendors, 70 fruitsellers and 65 tea stall owners. Their forced expiratory volume (FEV1), which is a measure of pulmonary function, was compared to their predicted FEV1, according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS)./The study revealed that a little above 50% of Kolkatans have relatively good lung function, regardless of the level of particulate matter./However, this does not necessarily mean good news./""This only establishes that lung function depends on a number of other factors like predisposition, immunity level, income level, diet, degree of exposure to combustion, as well as trade practiced,"" the survey said./It added that more than 20% of the city's population falls within the 'at risk' zone of lung disorders./Given the fact that all the volunteers were asymptomatic, this 'at risk' population at all of the sampled zones indicates a general trend towards poor lung function and respiratory problems among roadside workers./Although the study does not establish a direct relationship between air pollution and health problems, it concludes that ""citizens who are constantly exposed to particulate matter in a polluted urban environment, either during commuting or by way of their profession or exposure to combustion, have a trend towards poor lung function""./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Think before you breathe easy: Air pollution above limit,"Bhubaneswar: The air that you breathe in the city is not as safe as you may believe it to be. In fact, it's polluted enough to cause respiratory disorders./A report by the Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB) revealed that pollutants in the ambient air were found to be far above the permissible limit at all the six pollution monitoring stations in the city. To monitor pollution level on a regular basis, the pollution board has installed six pollution monitoring devices at Patrapada, the IRC village, the OSPCB office, the Capital police station, Rasulgarh and at the OSPCB laboratory in Chandrasekharpur./Surprisingly, it is not vehicular smoke that is the primary pollutant of city air. Pollution board sources said while vehicular pollution can be blamed for contributing 40% of the pollutants, the primary cause of air pollution in Bhubaneswar is stacking of construction material on roadsides and transportation of such materials in trucks and dumpers./""We have found that the level of particulate matter (PM-10) in the air is between 120 micro gram per metre cube and 213 microgram per metre cube while the permissible limit is 100 micro gram per metre cube,"" said OSPCB regional officer (Bhubaneswar) Hadibandhu Panigrahi, adding that the pollution board is directing concerned agencies to monitor piling up of construction materials and to ask construction companies to use sprinklers to suppress the dust./""The Board collates weekly data on air pollution from monitoring stations at six different places to determine the pollution levels. Usually, the PM-10 in the air is found to be higher in winter than in summer. But, a reverse trend is being seen in the city. Although winter is over, we are still recording high PM-10 here,"" said Panigrahi./The pollution board is trying to find out the reason as to why the city air is polluted in summer as well. ""In winter, the air pollution level remains high continuously; it is very difficult to reverse the trend as the low temperature keeps the air particles at a low level. The polluted air settles at the ground level and is not easily dispersed,"" he added./Director, Capital hospital, B B Patnaik, said that every day, about 30-40 adults and around the same number of children report to the hospital with respiratory disorders. ""Bad air quality can cause tuberculosis, bronchitis and dry cough,"" said director./A TOI story dated 16 January had brought to light the emission of pollutants from the crematorium located in the heart of the city at Satya Nagar. The smoke generated from the burning of human bodies also emits PM-10, which can cause pulmonary diseases. The smoke comes out of the burning chamber through the windows. A chimney is there to direct the smoke through it but it is not working, TOI had reported./Because of crematorium pollutants, some green campaigners had appealed to the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation to promote use of electric chamber for burning bodies. ""We will soon give direction to the City civic body to operationlise the crematorium chimney,"" said a pollution board officer. ""We may also reccommend use of scientific chimney like that of Puri Swargadwar (crematorium),"" he added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Is the air in your home more toxic than Deonar?,"The breeze has finally lifted the smog outside. Now don't let these sneaky indoor pollutants lodge in your lungs On Monday, Mumbai saw pollution levels decrease for the first time after the blaze in Deonar. The city recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 124, compared to the number in the 300s in the weeks that preceded. AQI gauges air quality depending on '24-hour averages' of pollutants like carbon monoxide and particulate matter, among others./So while you might be breathing easy right now (and every deep inhalation is well deserved) you might want to check in that other choke factor -indoor air pollutants. If you think rolling up the windows during your Uber ride is any protection, think again./How sure are you that the air you breathe at work, at home in the enclosed spaces you think are safe, is any better? Remember that office flu that was `in the air'? Turns out, even that is a form of air pollution.The sick building syndrome, as it is called, links a group of people who spend time together in the same building as they exhibit similar symptoms when ill. Unknown to you, the air at your home and office can be dirty and hazardous to your health. ""In fact, indoor air can be even more polluted than the air outdoors,"" warns Dr Kedar Toraska, Consultant, Chest Physician, Wockhardt Hospitals./Look out for tell-tale signs that indicate you might be breathing less-than-healthy air when indoors. Do you fall sick often? Do these symptoms stop when you leave the house or building? You may, literally, be allergic to your home or office. ""Indoor air pollution can cause irritation of eyes, nose, and throat. It can cause headaches and nausea. In extreme cases, it could cause asthma, allergies, and even damage the liver,"" says Dr Abhay Vispute, Consultant Physician, SRV Hospital./Indoor air pollutants are most likely to float from seemingly innocent, everyday products like perfumes, incense sticks, disinfectants, and sometimes even lingering food odours. Biological pollutants include pollen from plants, mite, hair from pets, fungi, parasites, and some bacteria. Heating, cooling and powering our homes all produce emissions that are harmful. However, hang on before you throw In your carpets away and force the dog to shower more frequently.Indoor air pollution can be easily prevented if you are more aware./""If you don't use a toxic chemical in the first place, then you don't have to contain it, clean it up, or be exposed to it -which is what preventing pollution is all about,"" says Dr Toraskar. Making simple changes to your shopping list or everyday habits goes a long way in improving the quality of air you breathe. Here's what healthcare experts advise about keeping indoor air pollution in check./Tobacco smoke - Ask those who live or work with you to smoke outdoors. Indoor tobacco smoke is a major contributor to airborne contaminants in the home and office. Over 4,000 chemical compounds, of which 40 are known or suspected carcinogens, have been identified in tobacco smoke./Household cleaners - Look out for labels that divulge the cleaner's chemical ingredients. Be sure to avoid using cleaners that contain suspect hormone disrupter chemicals like Nonyland octyl phenols, which are used to make alkylphenol ethoxylate (APE) detergents./Disinfectants - Limit the use of disinfecting products in your home, as children and pets in particular can be affected by it. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies disinfectants and antimicrobials as pesticides. They contain chemical agents that are capable of destroying or inhibiting the growth of microorganisms. Overuse could lead to the growth of 'superbugs.'/Building Materials - Plywood, kitchen cabinets and home insulation are all products that can contain formaldehyde, a known human cancer-causing chemical. Choose solid woods and formaldehyde-free insulation when constructing or renovating your home. Flexible vinyl household products like flooring and wallpaper are manufactured using PVC that may have toxic chemical additives, including lead. As these products are used, they create dusts that accumulate these chemicals. Choose non-PVC wall and floor coverings to minimise potential exposure to these toxins./Personal Care and Beauty Products - Choose products that are fragrance-free. Go easy on the hairspray and deodorants. Reduce your use of nail polish and acetone nail polish remover. If you do use these products, be sure to open your windows while doing so./Fungus and Mold - Dry is the operative word. Prevent mold and the overuse of bleach by preventing moisture build-up in the first place. Fix leaky pipes and faucets immediately. Keep the air systems, like fans and air conditioners clean and regularly supervise them for any fungus or mold that may have begun to grow around them./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Lung disorder due to morning walk? Blame it on pollutants,"Patna: Morning walk, they say, is the panacea for many ills. However, many health freaks are giving up this habit as a supposedly healthy exercise, according to them, has become a health hazard due to air pollution in Patna./Theirs are not unfounded fears. Pollutant figures released on hourly basis by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board back their claim./The particulate matter of 2.5 microns is a major pollutant. Against the standard limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre (mg/m3) volume of air, it was 249mg/m3 at 8am, 231mg/m3 at 7am, 209mg/m3 at 6am and 177mg/m3 at 5am on Tuesday./Tuesday was selected as a random day and the pollutants were measured near the city planetarium. As the day progressed, notably, the levels decreased to146mg/m3 at noon and then started increasing in evening hours./Those who take a walk in the open after dinner also need to know a couple of hard facts. The particulate matter was 205mg/m3 at 8pm followed by 187mg/m3 after an hour and 195mg/m3 after another one hour. Similar was the trend of other pollutants like carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, nitrogen-dioxide and ozone./""Pollutants generally go up in the air. However, the winter fog creates a layer at the lower level of the atmosphere, which prevents the pollutants from going up,"" a pollution control board expert told TOI on Wednesday, adding the pollutants thus remain present in the atmosphere at a lower level in a condensed form in winter./Patna University's botany department head Shardendu nods. ""If you make an intra-day comparison, you will find pollutant levels decreasing in noon,"" he said and added pollutants go up due to sun rays and, as such, they decrease earlier in summer than winter during daytime./Particulate matter is mainly emitted by vehicles. Dust created at construction sites adds to particulate matter. Carbon monoxide is in the air because of biomass. Sulphur's source is coal consumption. Nitrogen gases are emitted by fuels consumed during transportation./So, should morning walkers give up walking altogether? No, says Dr Surya Kant, Indian Chest Society (ICS) national president and head of TB and chest department of King George Medical University in Lucknow. The remedy, according to him, is simple: Go out for a walk only when the fog is gone and the sun is out./""If morning walkers don't pay heed to this, they may suffer from pharyngitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, TB, pneumonia and even lung cancer,"" the Lucknow doctor told TOI over the phone./However, only particulate matter of the size ranging between 2microns and 10 microns is harmful. According to the ICS president, morning walkers already susceptible to lung diseases must take steam twice. ""Steam produces heat that heals inflammation (swelling) of airway. Even healthy morning walkers can adopt this practice,"" he said./Dr Surya Kant added foods rich in antioxidants (vitamin E, vitamin C and salenium) are ""nasal scavengers""; that is, they clean your nose. ""Adopt green-orange-red formula: Take green vegetables, oranges and tomatoes and carrot (red),"" he advises one and all./Date: February 8, 2016, Source: BSPCB/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

The Apan Vayu Mudra (see box) also called Heart Mudra, can help battle bad effects of pollution, by enhancing oxygen supply to the heart and lungs, and flushing out toxins.""/Fitness trainer Asif Shaikh states, ""People who Shaikh states, ""People who exercise have to be smart to choose a place away from too much pollution -gardens, beaches etc. When we exercise we inhale up to 20 times more air than normal. The absorption levels of our body is also very high during exercising and our immunity is low, so chances of being influenced by any kind of lung infections are very high."" Reiterating that Dr Vijay Dsilva, critical care specialist says, ""In the last few months Mumbai has seen a 50 per cent increase in lung patients.The BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) should take steps to curb pollution levels. There is no way one can escape it.""/You could try the following to deal with air pollution/USE SALT LAMPS AND TAKE SALT THERAPY/Lighting a salt lamp in your home could help in combating air pollution. Jamsheed says, ""Salt lamps absorb dust particles and work by cleaning your surrounding air."" Salt acts like a cleanser, is anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory. It helps remove air-borne pollen and allergens./DO THE APAN VAYU MUDRA/Sit on a chair (cross your feet for the energy bandha) or yoga mat in sukhasan. Begin with folded hands (prayer pose) and the loud chanting of Om seven times. Now, begin the Apan Vayu Mudra or Heart Mudra. Fold your index finger to touch the base of the thumb. Connect the middle and ring finger to the thumb. Let the little finger extend outwards.Connect your breath to the heart chakra and imagine there is a funnel at the centre of your chest. Inhale exhale slowly, easily, only through nose, keeping your mouth shut. The breathing must not be choppy or jerky. Do not struggle to lengthen or shorten inhalation or exhalation. Your body knows what it has to do, we are all auto-operative./USE AIR PURIFIERS AT HOME/A room of about 200 sq feet takes around 18 minutes to be clean of pollutants. Air purifiers today are intelligent, smaller, have wheels to move them to different rooms, connect to your phones, have sensors to control them by just moving your hand over them, and can also be app monitored./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Traffic police vulnerable to pollution: Study,"Mangaluru: Did you know that traffic cops in Kudla are the worst affected by vehicular pollution? A recent study shows that Mangaluru City Traffic Police (MCTP) has been most vulnerable to pollution./Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) conducted by Anti-Pollution Drive (APD) Foundation has concluded with some startling facts that significant amount of MCTP have affected their lungs. ""PFT was carried out on 115 traffic police and results show that 22.3% of the police having lesser than five or lesser years of service are showing signs of restrictive lungs.

This includes how well you are able to breathe and how effective your lungs are able to bring oxygen to the rest of your body./APD, a citizens' initiative, born in Namma Kudla is deeply distressed to caution that Mangaluru too is headed in the undesirable direction./Abdullah said it was held to test people who are most vulnerable to impact of air pollution including traffic police. The results of these test will used by APD to test the actual impact of air pollution on health of people in the city, thereby assessing the issue at hand./Dr Irfan, respiratory medicine department, Yenepoya University, who conducted the test pointed there is a significant correlation in lung function and exposure to vehicular pollutants. Number of traffic police with restriction increased with duration of exposure. ""Problem can be solved only when there is reduction in air pollution from traffic police going in for restrictive lung disease. Reduction in exposure by use of protective gears like pollution mask, reduction in the duration of exposure in a day will also help in improving their lung function. Monitoring vehicles above 10 years for pollution would also help in minimizing the level of pollution,"" he pointed out./Through PFT results, APD further wants to study pollution levels in Mangaluru and related issues./Abdullah said: ""APD will be able to identify the impact on most effected group, and second identify the location and area they are working and start monitoring pollution levels in these areas. We will use this information to identify junctions that are most affected and further work towards categorical mitigation.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution tied to top two causes of death in India,"NEW DELHI: Air pollution is an important risk factor for top two causes of death in the country-ischemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-health minister J P Nadda told Lok Sabha on Friday. Nadda said water and soil pollution were associated with acute diarrhoeal diseases, typhoid, cholera, gastroenteritis, worm infestations, hepatitis and others. ""Air pollution is one of the several risk factors in occurrence of such acute respiratory conditions (childhood pneumonia, bronchial asthma), chronic respiratory diseases, lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases,"" he said. In an assessment made during the World Health Assembly last year in Geneva, WHO for the first time discussed the impact of air pollution on health. The UN agency estimated that one in eight deaths around the globe was due to the same.

"Pollution, prolonged computer usage increase eye ailments","Visakhapatnam: Eyes are one of the most precious organs of the human body and these delicate organs need to be handled with utmost care to preserve one's eyesight life long. Various types of eye ailments can occur at different ages. People are mostly ignorant of the symptoms and go to doctors at a later stage by when usually considerable damage would already been done to the eyes. /Though cataract is still the most common eye disease, afflicting around 25 per cent patients with eye ailments, glaucoma has become a silent killer of the eyes, and can be observed more in those suffering from diabetes. Besides, refractive errors in school going children, pollution related dry eyes and computer vision syndrome in the working professionals are other commonly occurring eye ailments. For almost all eye ailments, the risk increases if there's a family history of the disease, aver doctors.Dr KVV Satyanarayana, assistant professor at the Government Regional Eye Hospital, (GREH), Vizag, said, ""Cataract is common among the 50 plus age group and we operate 40-50 cases daily. Congenital cataract is also observed in infants, which can be hereditary or due to maternal infection. Such cataracts need early screening and surgery when the infant is within two months of age. As for glaucoma, the symptoms are occasional headaches and one needs to go for regular check-ups post 40 years of age, especially if there's a family history and the person is diabetic. Diabetics also experience floaters eye disorder or the sensation of something floating before the eyes. It can be due to retinal detachment or if something is wrong with the retina. Also, if a woman sees coloured halos at night, it can be an early indication of glaucoma while for men, it might be a symptom of cataract.""""For school children, yearly screening and rectification of refractive errors (for myopia, hypermetropia and astigmatism) is essential. But Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) is worrisome as most working professionals complain of headache, itching, burning and watery sensation in the eyes. To minimize the risk of CVS, one should use protective glasses if required, ensure that no light is reflected on the computer screen, take hourly breaks from the monitor and lubricate the eyes with medically prescribed eye drops if required. Moreover, the computer should be placed at least at two feet distance from the eyes and the monitor should be at a 20 degree angle below the eyes,"" added Dr Satyanarayana. Secretary of District Blindness Control Society (DBCS) Prof Dr P Krishna Prasad said, ""Dry eye syndrome is becoming quite common among denizens due to the prevailing air pollution, which is always showing an upward trend. Prolonged exposure to the computer screen also causes this syndrome. It happens when water gets evaporated from the eyes and patients experience dryness of eyes, foreign object sensation in the eyes and may get dark or red spots on the eyes (pterygium). Using lubricating eye drops and avoiding exposure to pollution or wearing protected glass while driving two-wheelers are the remedies to reduce the impact of dust and pollutants.""Besides, complaints of allergic eye diseases or allergic conjunctivitis, causing redness, itching and dryness of the eyes, are also common mainly due to pollution, added the doctor./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

""The district health machinery has all the needed facility to treat TB. Currently, we have the advanced cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification testing (CBNAAT) machine to detect the presence of TB bacteria in a human body. While one machine is available at the Nashik civil hospital, another one has been set up at the NMC's Zakir Hussain hospital. One more machine will be set up at the government hospital in Malegaon within the next couple of weeks,"" said Jagdale. He further said that a large number of people suffering from TB visited private doctors, who, most of the time end up giving tablets without ensuring that the patient would continue with the medication. On the other hand, government hospitals have the necessary machinery, treatment plan under supervision and also maintains the record and registration to ensure that the patients complete their medication course and are cured of the disease, added Jagdale. District TB officer and city TB officer for Malegaon Yuvraj Deore said, ""Cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification testing (CBNAAT) machine is necessary in Malegaon as the town is overcrowded, which increases the chances of high rate of transmission of the disease.

The respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) which indicates the volume of dust particles caught in the atmosphere has been much above 60 microns per cubic meter in all the four main stations in the city.A pulmonary medicine department in one of the tertiary care hospitals in Kochi conducted tests on allergic patients and found dust mite and fungus (aspergillus) in more than 70% of the patients.Doctors say that the tropical climate aids the fungus which is commonly seen in Kerala. /""But we are seeing it in many of the patients who come with mild to acute bronchitis to which the dust allergy is a trigger. The patients coming with lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchitis have also increased,"" said Dr Rajesh V, senior pulmonologist, Rajagiri hospital, Aluva.He said that those prone to asthma end up with that condition earlier than they would have otherwise because of the air pollution. For people with respiratory ailments, even small increases in dust concentration can make their symptoms worse.""What is definitely worrying is that children of non-asthmatic parents are also showing symptoms of asthma,"" said Dr George Mothi, senior pulmonologist at Medical Trust hospital.While there is no hard evidence that links dust to asthma, breathing-in air containing high concentrations of dust, over many years, is thought to reduce lung function and contribute to disorders like chronic bronchitis, heart and lung disorders.Dr Mothi said that vehicular pollution is also high, especially when there are regular traffic snarls. Yet another concern is the burning of waste in the evenings and early mornings. ""People don't seem to realise the amount of pollution they are causing by burning plastic,"" Dr Mothi said.Pollution control board officials have decided to increase the number of monitoring stations in the city. The central pollution control board (CPCB) has asked the state board to increase the monitoring systems including public display boards in as many places as possible.

The fire which broke out at the Deonar dumping ground in January 2016 caused the BMC to shut down 74 schools run by it for two days, as the smoke from the ground veiled the area causing breathing difficulties.""The NGO has said the incidents of fire are the making of both MPCB and BMC which are jointly and severally responsible for implementation and monitoring of the provisions of Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 1999.""The members of MPCB and Municipal Commissioner, BMC have committed offences under the provision of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the rules, regulation and notifications issued there under and Section 26 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Section 21 of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1988, for their failure to arrest the ever increasing air pollution caused due to recurrent incidents of fire at Deonar dumping ground thereby causing public nuisance. /The violation of the aforesaid Acts is a continuous offence and is committed by the aforesaid officers of the board members of MPCB and municipal commissioner, BMC every moment/day by their non actions despite filing of various complaints in the past by the citizens of Mumbai,"" reads the letter./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
SC seeks report on reducing Moksh Dham pollution,"AGRA: The Supreme Court has given time till June 30, 2016 to the Agra Development Authority to submit its final report on the action plan to reduce air pollution due to burning of bodies at Moksh Dham (crematorium) near the Taj Mahal./According to ADA officials, three proposals were submitted to the court recently. On the March 30 hearing, the apex court directed the civic body to submit the best possible method to deal with the issue at hand./ADA's town planner Ajay Kumar Singh told TOI that a committee headed by senior administrative officials would now discuss the matter and zero in on the most effective project./Among the three options, the wet scrubber technique is said to be the most effective one to reduce pollution level at Moksh Dham. Under the wet scrubber system, smoke from pyres will be passed through a water channel which in turn will reduce emission of carbon particles, supposedly one of the main causes for the 17th century white marble monument turning yellow./Meanwhile, the court gave its approval to install an electric cremation chamber at Moksh Dham. This service will be free of cost./Another proposal was offsetting a 'green' cremation system, Mokshda, which could supposedly reduces the wood requirements for burning a body to nearly a quarter of what is used in the traditional method. Around 400 kg of wood is required in the traditional method./The third proposal was similar to Mokshda. On November 16, 2015, a bench of Justice TS Thakur and Justice C Nagappan had given three weeks' time to the Central Environment Committee (CEC) to suggest an alternate space for the crematorium near the Taj. At least 25 pyres are burnt here each day, and the ashes rising from these have been damaging the Taj, studies have found./Later in December, the court deferred the shifting of the cremation ground and asked the authorities to look into ways of reducing carbon emission from burning of pyres as well as beautifying the place./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Ghazipur landfill fire spews toxic smoke,"Ghaziabad: Parts of the giant pile of trash at the Ghazipur landfill site have been on fire for the last couple of weeks, sending spirals of toxic smoke continuously into the air near the Delhi-UP border.

"Ranked 5th clean city, Vizag finds air pollution on the rise","Visakhapatnam: Vizag, which was ranked the fifth clean city in the Swachh Bharat Survekshan conducted by the Union ministry of urban development, is finding its air pollution levels turning for the worse with each passing day. According to the observations made by the AP Pollution Control Board (APPCB), Visakhapatnam city daily registers air pollutants above the average levels of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) set by the Central Pollution Control Board.As per the recordings in the city on Thursday, benzene registered the highest level of 14.8 mg/m3 against the NAAQS standard of 4.55 mg/m3. Similarly, the level of carbon monoxide in the city atmosphere was 1.71 mg/m3 against the standard of 0.74mg/m3, ammonia registered 10.9 mg/m3 against the 7.11 mg/m3, nitrogen dioxide 43.3 mg/m3 against the 21.67 mg/m3, ozone 65.7 mg/m3 against the 33.24mg/m3, PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers) registered 146 mg/m3 against the standard of 76.13mg/m3, PM 2.5 registered 66 mg/m3 against the 37 mg/m3 and finally sulphur dioxide registered 53.5 mg/m3 against the NAAQS standard of 26.53 mg/m3.Medical experts and doctors feel that air pollutants can cause respiratory health diseases besides skin damages and hair-fall. /Dr KV Ram Kumar, managing director of Lakshmi Gayatri Hospital at Akkayyapalem, said registration of high level of benzene, carbon monoxide, ammonia and sulphur in the air can cause Eosinophilic bronchitis, a type of respiratory ailment. It often results in a chronic cough even though lung function tests would be usually normal. This apart, damages to skin and hair-fall are also reported due to air pollution, Dr KV Ram said. ""I come across two to three cases having respiratory problems daily at my clinic,"" Ram said.APPCB Visakhapatnam unit's environmental engineer R Laxmi Narayana attributed the high level of pollutants to various reasons, particularly the high presence of diesel fuelled motor vehicles in the city. ""Usage of either green vehicles or petrol fuelled vehicles can somehow prevent the alarming levels of the pollutants in the air,"" Laxmi Narayana told TOI.When contacted, Road Transport Authority (RTA) deputy transport commissioner V Venkateswara Rao said above 90% of the 82,000 odd commercial transport vehicles in Visakhapatnam district are diesel fuelled as per their general observations. The Visakhapatnam regional RTA has 10.32 lakh motor vehicles including 8.5 lakh two-wheelers and 30,000 three-wheelers like auto-rickshaws.""Around 7 lakh motor vehicles daily move in GVMC limits. The vehicles include 40,000 cars, 30,000 autos, 4 lakh two-wheelers, 2,000 goods and 500 RTC buses. We also book cases against the vehicles which flout pollution norms. We booked 1,450 cases including 1,100 in Vizag city last fiscal and fined Rs 14.5 lakh,"" Venkateswara Rao said.Laxmi Narayana said tree plantation, daily cleaning of roads and other areas can reduce the level of air-pollution in the city. ""The recent efforts by authorities in the wake of international fleet review (IFR) gave good results in improving the pollution levels when compared with the last five years. Such efforts should be continued in the long run for further improvement,"" Laxmi Narayana stated.Some of the highly polluted areas in the city are Gnanapuram, Police Barracks, Burujupeta, Fishing Harbour, Jagadamba Centre, Surya Bagh, Kancharapalem, NAD Kottaroad, Maddilapalem, Gajuwaka, Gopalapatnam, Madhurawada, Dwarakanagar, Dabagardens, Visakhapatnam Port Area, 104 Area, Sheela Nagar, Thatichetlapalem./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Polluted, yet personal vehicle culture intact","Pune: Most cities in India, including Pune, are choking on air pollution caused by the exhaust from aging vehicles, those that run on diesel, construction dust and smoke and particles from the burning of garbage. Every now and then, there is a hue and cry about discouraging the use of personal vehicles on the roads, yet statistics show that it shows no sign of falling. Nearly half the population in Pune city alone (about 35 lakh as per Census 2011) uses two-wheelers or cars, according to a report compiled by the urban development ministry. The study blamed low parking charges for the preference to personal vehicles.The mode of transport in Pune shows that nearly 38% people use two-wheelers, the highest among 10 cities, including Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Kanpur. /Though Pune's population is less than many of these cities, the number of people relying on two-wheelers for transport is phenomenally high.Regional Transport Office staff said two lakh vehicles were added in a span of 10 months beginning from April 2015. Of the total 2.04 lakh vehicles registered till January this year, about 1.46 lakh are motorcycles and 39,000 are cars. Nearly 20,400 vehicles were registered every month since April 2015.In Pune, despite the comprehensive mobility plan pointing out that parking charges should be higher, corporators have been opposing the move. Parking charges in other Indian cities are also abysmally low which encourages the use of personal vehicles leading to traffic congestion in the central and congested areas. Many cities abroad have steep parking charges which deters people from using personal vehicles. The urban development ministry has cited the example of London city with high parking charges are a tool to reduce traffic congestion.The ministry, which came out with its first report on urban statistics, has a comparison of parking charges in Indian cities as well as charges in cities, abroad. ""Parking charges in India are less. Higher parking charges create a disincentive for using private vehicles for transport and are an important tool in promoting public transport. In cities like London, parking charges have been used as an instrument to reduce congestion on roads. It can also be an important source of financing municipal corporations,"" the ministry added. The ministry during the UPA-II tenure had asked cities to explore the possibility of increasing parking charges. Pune Municipal Corporation's comprehensive mobility plan said there should be limited parking space as well as high parking charges, so that more people opt for using public transport. At present, most roads in the city have free parking, the CMP said. There is a revenue generation potential through parking charges. Parking structures in the core city area in the development plan should be implemented and that the parking plazas should improve traffic circulation in the vicinity, the plan added.Retired town planning expert R N Gohad said parking charges should be increased substantially for reducing traffic congestion on the roads. ""Parking on roads is almost free. The carriage width on the roads reduces considerably and this leads to severe traffic congestion,"" he said. The use of personal vehicles, he said, is because public transport is inefficient. ""There is at least one vehicle, either a two-wheeler or a car in each family. Public transport should be improved so that this use of personal vehicles is reduced. Parking problems have affected a lot of cities around the world and they have all managed to tackle the menace,"" he added. The urban statistics report shows that public transport in all the cities is on the decline. With incessant growth of personal transport, sustaining urban transport has become a challenge for policymakers and urban planners, the ministry stated.While 38% Puneites use two-wheelers, the percentage of personal motorized transport increases if the 10% people who use cars are added. This means that nearly half the travellers use personal transport. The share of public transport in Pune is a poor 12%.Several non-governmental organizations have stressed the need for better and safe pedestrian facilities. ""Pune faces severe problems like traffic congestion and pollution. This situation is a direct outcome of flawed traffic and transportation policies which promote use of private vehicles by providing more and more road space, flyovers, subways and one-way plans. There is utter neglect of public transport and non-motorized transport like walking and cycling. Congestion affects movement of buses and pedestrians the most, further making these modes less attractive,"" Prashant Inamdar, convener of Pedestrians First, said.The urban statistics show that 24% people walk, while cycle is a mode of transport only for 8% of the population, and another 8% uses autorickshaws.Senior officials of transport utility Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) admit that the city's public transport is in a bad shape. ""The municipal corporations of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad as well as the state government should help PMPML in building new depots and workshops. The present infrastructure is in a bad condition. PMPML needs more funds,'' a senior official said. Many buses are more than eight years old and suffer mechanical breakdowns. Repair and maintenance are challenges, the officials added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Indian-American kids swarm White House science fair 2016,"WASHINGTON: If you want to see why folks of Indian-origin - NRIs, PIOs, ABCDs, call them what you will - are hitting the high spots in academic achievement and entrepreneurial excellence, the Science Fair that President Obama is hosting at the White House on Wednesday provides a fair clue. Nearly a third of the projects, demos, and experiments in the jamboree involve kids of Indian-origin, and they provide a window into how this ethnic group, along with other Asian-Americans, has come to dominate school-level STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) competitions, including events hosted by companies such as Intel, Google, and Westinghouse. The White House bash is now the acme of high-school STEM endeavors.None of this should be new to President Obama, whose frequent hosting of such STEM galas in the White House has seen a fair sprinkling of Indian-American honorees, from his recognition of Stanford's Pune-born Tom Kailath with the Presidential Medal for Science, to his schmoozing with high-schoolers Shree Bose and Anand Srinivasan, who went on to Harvard and MIT respectively. He just seems to love it, and ahead of what will be the sixth and final science fair he will be hosting for school grads, he explained his motivation as follows: ""If you win the NCAA (sports) championship, you come to the White House. /Well, if you're a young person and you produce the best experiment or design, the best hardware or software, you ought to be recognized for that achievement, too.""Few students take this challenge - and invitation - more seriously than Indian-Americans, most of them children of parents who are themselves steeped in STEM. This year's finalists who will be at the White House includes Yashaswini Makaram, 17, of Massachusetts, who has created a new cell phone security tool that records the distinctive arm and hand motions people use to lift a cell phone from a table to uniquely identify the cell phone's owner. To date, the technology correctly identifies a cell phone's owner 85 per cent of the time and differentiates among people with 93 percent accuracy. Yashaswini's biometric research, which was recognized as part of the 2016 Intel Science Talent Search, may lead to greater personalization of mobile devices, according to a White House factsheet.(Image courtesy: White House)Eighteen-year old Sanjana Rane from Kentucky has helped discover how a particular protein could be used to detect and treat renal fibrosis. Sanjana first became interested in pursuing medical research when she read a USA Today study ranking Louisville, her hometown, as having some of the worst air quality in the United States. She began to look into the dangers of air pollution and learned about the chemical acrolein, which is found in both cigarette and industrial smoke and can cause kidney damage. She worked on how to shift acrolein's influence on the kidneys by using a particular protein as a therapeutic target, winning a scholarship at the Siemens Competition in Math, Science & Technology for her effort.At least two projects demo-ing in the White House had their origins from student experiences in India. The sight of children in India drinking dirty, unsafe water led New Hampshire's Deepika Kurup to work on solar-powered technology to rapidly remove bacteria from water, making her a finalist in the 2015 Google Science Fair and a winner of the National Geographic Explorer Award. Anurudh Ganesan, now 16, recalls how his grandparents walked him 10 miles to a remote clinic in India in order to receive a vaccination and they arrived, the vaccines were ineffective due to the high temperatures and lack of refrigeration. Now living in Maryland, Anurudh worked on exploring ways of refrigerating vaccines immediately prior to use, particularly in developing countries. His creation, VAXXWAGON, can effectively transport vaccines in the last leg of distribution without the use of ice and electricity, saving potentially thousands of lives throughout the world.Some of the projects also involve frugal engineering. Astounded at the price of diagnostic spirometers - machines used to analyze lung health by having patients blow into them - San Jose, California high schooler Maya Varma developed a 3D printed version that costs a mere $35. Maya's (literally) breathtaking invention earned her a slot as a 2016 Intel STS finalist, where her spirometer was selected as one of the top 40 projects in the nation.Obama has been an alarmist about the purported decline of STEM studies in the US, but also a cheerleader for restoring American primacy in the field. ""As a society, we have to celebrate outstanding work by young people in science at least as much as we do Super Bowl winners,"" he said at one previous White House Science Fair. ""Because superstar biologists and engineers and rocket scientists and robot-builders - they're what's going to transform our society. They're the folks who are going to come up with cures for diseases and new sources of energy, and help us build healthier, more successful societies."" Indian-American kids have heard him loud and clear. The White House factsheet also gives a shout-out to Infosys Foundation and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) among many institutions and companies that are promoting computer science education in the US./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
9 scrap dealers held for Deonar blazes,"Mumbai: The Deonar police on Friday evening arrested nine scrap dealers for the January 28 and March 20 blazes at the dumping ground at Deonar./Sources said that a probe headed by additional commissioner of police (east region) Manoj Lohiya prima facie found that they were not accidental but the handiwork of the scrap dealers./Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had in February, after the January 28 fire, ordered a high-level probe by the additional commissioner of police. The police said Lohiya's probe had hinted at sabotage./The scrap dealers who do not have any licence or authority to conduct business used to send minor children to collect scrap, the police said. The nine dealers have their shops/godowns adjoining the dumping ground compound wall. The police said the dealers, who will be produced before court on Saturday, have been booked under various sections for negligence, causing damage to public property, mischief by fire and act to hurt somebody under the Indian Penal Code./The children, on orders from their employers, used to light fires so that the garbage burns, and it used to get easy for them to pick up leftover metal,"" said a police officer. Deputy commissioner of police (zone VI) Sangramsingh Nishandar confirmed the arrests./The scrap dealers' names cropped up during inquiries and recording of statements of several independent witnesses./Sources said that the dealers will be interrogated about who sent the children to light the fire on March 20 at the Deonar dumping ground. The fire started around 10am, by afternoon, thick smoke covered areas like Rafiq Nagar and Baba Nagar adjoining the dump, and it moved towards Navi Mumbai. By March 21 morning, smoke had reached Wadala, though the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said it had brought the fire under control to an extent around 4.30am. Fresh flames were reported once again on the evening of March 21./Earlier on January 28, at 3am, a fire broke out at the dumping ground. The smoke in nearby areas forced schools to remain shut. The fire was finally extinguished on February 5./The fire had led to health hazards for residents and there was an increase in air pollution./Fire-fighters were deployed at the spot till April 2. The BMC had filed an FIR against unknown persons, suspecting sabotage. Cooling operations continue at the dump yard./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Leafy neighbourhood adds years to a woman's life,"Ladies, if you want to live longer, you may want to think of living in the leafy suburbs as a new study suggests so. The study by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) found that women live longer in areas with more green vegetation./It showed that women with the highest levels of vegetation or greenness near their homes had a 12% lower death rate compared to women with the lowest levels of vegetation near their homes. The researchers found the biggest differences in death rates from kidney disease, respiratory disease, and cancer. The researchers also explored how an environment with trees, shrubs, and plants might lower mortality rates. They showed that improved mental health and social engagement are the strongest factors, while increased physical activity and reduced air pollution also contribute./NIEHS director Linda Birnbaum noted that it is important to know that trees and plants provide health benefits in our communities as well as beauty. The finding of reduced mortality suggests that vegetation may be important to health in a broad range of ways. The scientists also looked at characteristics that can otherwise contribute to mortality risk, such as age, race, ethnicity, smoking, and socio-economic status. This enabled them to be more confident that vegetation plays a role in reduced mortality, rather than these factors.

Gurgaon sees 30% rise in respiratory diseases,"Gurgaon: Every year, stubble burning leads to an increase in respiratory diseases in the city in the month of April. According to doctors, asthma and other respiratory diseases are triggered during this time of the year mainly due to the worsening air pollution caused by the illegal practice of burning paddy stubble. The city's top three private hospitals witness an increase of about 20% to 30% in the number of such cases in April.""There is a sudden increase of around 20% in the number of asthma cases, cough-related illness and other respiratory diseases after Baisakhi, when stubble burning is done in Haryana and Punjab. /Despite a strict ban, crops are burnt during this season,"" said Dr Himanshu Garg, a city-based pulmonologist, who also blamed waste burning in open areas for increasing air pollution.Dr Piyush Goel from Colombia Asia hospital said, ""The process of husk removal also leads to pollution. We see an increase of 25 to 30% during this time in cases of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD - a heart disease that makes it difficult to breathe), and various allergies.""Air pollution level in the city also seems to have increased. If data released by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) is to be believed, PM2.5 has increased by 20 notches in the last 15 days. While the maximum level of PM2.5 was recorded at 101.37 ug/m3 on April 1, it was recorded at 131 ug/m3 on Friday. The level of sulphur oxides has also increased from about 41ug/m3 to 56 ug/m3 in the last 15 days.As per the provisions of Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, Haryana's environment department issue a notification to farmers from time to time in order to prohibit the burning of agricultural waste in the fields.According to experts, the burning of crop waste in Punjab and Haryana adds to air pollution even places like Delhi and other NCR cities.""Burning a ton of rice straw releases about 5 kg of nitrogen in the air, besides releasing other pollutants such as potassium and sulphur. Stubble burning also leads to deteriorating quality of soil,"" said Dr Bhim Singh Gahlot, a city-based agricultural scientist.The offocials of HSPCB, however, refused to buy the argument that stubble burning is a major cause of concern in the city.

"Among metros, Delhi worst hit by PM2.5: Study","NEW DELHI: A study by the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences at IIT Delhi, which looked at exposure to PM 2.5 and premature deaths caused by the particulate matter pollution, has revealed that Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh is the cleanest district while Delhi is the dirtiest metropolitan area in the country./According to researchers who relied on satellite-based estimate, PM2.5 in Kinnaur was found to be 3.7+-1 microgram per cubic metre (\xB5g/m\xB3) annually, which is less than 10% of the national air quality target of 40\xB5g/m\xB3./Delhi's PM2.5 level, they added, stood at 148+-51\xB5g/m\xB3 annually, which is several times higher than the safe limit./Short-term exposure to PM2.5, a widespread air pollutant, causes bronchitis, allergies, persistent cough and inflammation of airways. But chronic exposure to these fine particles emitted from vehicles could lead to premature deaths as a result of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke and lung cancer./According to the IIT study, 2.79 lakh Indians die prematurely because of COPD, 1.1 lakh die of IHD, 88,700 of stroke and 14,800 deaths are caused by lung cancer. Many more die because of indoor air pollution that is caused by the burning of biomass fuels in rural areas, Sagnik Dey, one of its authors, told TOI. The study has been published in ""Environment International"" journal./He said only coordinated efforts by all states could prevent such deaths. Dey suggested steps such as curbing vehicle emissions, checking the use of biomass fuels and large-scale plantations to tackle the problem of air pollution. ""At present, only 0.06% of the population is breathing safe air as defined by WHO,"" he said./If India manages to achieve an annual target of 40\xB5g/m\xB3 for PM 2.5, almost 45,000 people can be saved from dying prematurely because of illnesses linked to high levels of pollution, researchers claim./The 2010 Global Burden Diseases report by WHO used a common methodology for all countries, but the IIT experts said they used different parameters for different districts to ensure better results. ""Delhi, for example, may be the dirtiest metropolitan area in terms of ambient PM2.5 level, but premature deaths are lower in the city because of better health facilities,"" said Dey./On the Delhi government's odd-even initiative, the IIT professor said it was too early to deliver any verdict.

However, there are actually various sources of pollution that have a negative effect on air quality, many of which are found inside our homes and offices. /From cooking residue to paints, varnishes and fungal spores the air we breathe indoors is often more polluted than that outside,"" explained Dr Prashant Kumar of the University of Surrey.In 2012 indoor air pollution was linked to 4.3 million deaths globally, compared with 3.7 million for outdoor air pollution. Urban dwellers typically spend 90% of their time indoors, and this has been linked to 'Sick Building Syndrome' where dwellers exhibit a range of ill health effects related to breathing indoor air. Whether the use of coal and wood for cooking, to microbial contaminants including bacteria and viruses these effects include respiratory disease and reduced cognitive function.""It is essential that we are able to effectively monitor indoor air pollution so that we can better understand when and where levels are worst, and in turn offer solutions to make our air healthier. Our work looks at the use of small, low-energy monitoring sensors that would be able to gather real-time data and tell families or workers when levels of pollutants are too high,"" continued Dr Kumar.""Sometimes the solution to this will be as simple as opening a window, but without knowledge at the right time these simple steps are often skipped. With this research we are calling for greater importance to be placed on ensuring buildings are built with indoor pollution monitoring in mind. As we enter the age of smart cities this is one way in which technology will actively benefit health.""In another paper published earlier this month in the journal Environmental Pollution, Dr Kumar and PhD student, Anju Goel, also found that outdoor air pollution was at a high where buildings were located at traffic intersections. Even where there was low traffic volume, traffic intersections with densely built up surroundings showed twice the concentration than at open junctions. Exposure to these concentrations showed that ground floor dwellings in these areas were exposed to twice as many harmful particles.Dr Kumar concluded, ""This has important implications for town planning and we should consider whether we really want schools, offices or hospitals to be built within these environments. Most people may not even consider what they or their children are breathing when they sit down at their desks each morning. A combination of policy and technology will help ensure that while we are hard at work our buildings are also working to protect us from harmful pollutants that affect both mind and body.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Farmers burn stubble, people's health suffers","LUDHIANA: With the district administration failing to impose a ban on stubble burning effectively, the practice by farmers is having an effect on the health of the residents as many of them are complaining of respiratory, skin and eye problems.After harvesting the crop in March, farmers burn wheat stubble to avoid bearing the expense of cutting and transporting it. Though the practice has been banned for years, farmers continue to burn stubble. According to pulmonary medicine specialists in hospitals, there has been an increase in the number of cases of patients suffering from naso-bronchial diseases, including asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Dr Gurpreet Singh, a senior consultant of pulmonary medicine at a private hospital in Sherpur Chowk, said, ""Recently, there has been an increase in the number of patients with respiratory problems triggered by stubble burning. We receive about 20 cases of asthma and COPD on a daily basis; this is more than four times on normal days. /Asthma is more common among children, teenagers and younger adults, while COPD is more common amongst aged persons."". The doctor said that some patients showing severe symptoms had been admitted to the hospital. ""We have admitted 5 such people at present,"" he said.Areas where farmers are burning stubble in the district include: Doraha, Sahnewal, Jagraon, Lalton, Samrala, and Machiwara. A source said that if the authorities concerned did not prevent farmers from burning stubble, smog would soon envelop Ludhiana city.A skin specialists said there had been an increase in the number of patients coming with allergic reactions in harvest season. ""The increase in the air pollution level due to stubble burning has resulted in the increase in the number of cases of air-borne contact dermatitis by around 10-15%. It results in itching and rashes on the skin,"" said Dr Bimal Kanish, a dermatologist at Christian Medical College and Hospital.Health tipsIdentify allergen and avoid of exposure to itPut on a mask to protect your nose and face.Don not not stop or decrease asthma medication during this timeRush to chest specialist immediately so that severity shouldn't riseWear full-sleeved shirts and full pantsUse chemical-free sunscreens while going outConsult a dermatologist in case of severe itching and redness'Action soon, govt serious about problem'A senior official of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), who did not wish to be named, said the pollution board and state government were serious about keeping a check on the problem. ""Various methods are being developed, including using stubble for power generation. We do book farmers for violating the ban, but registering cases against every farmer who burns stubble is not possible,"" he said. ""SPM level does go up manyfold when the practice is at full swing. The spread of these air pollutants depends on weather conditions, which is more during sunny weather,"" the official said, adding that there was not much difference in the values of NOX and SO2 levels, as these are in gaseous form and there values are not impacted much by the smoke due to stubble burning.Responding to the non-implementation of the complete ban on stubble burning, deputy commissioner Ravi Bhagat said they had already passed orders against the practice. ""I will be asking the police commissioner and the SSPs of Khanna and Jagraon to strictly enforce the orders and register FIRs against those found burning stubble,"" he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Reduce exposure to toxic air: US expert,"New Delhi: The Delhi government's pollution control measures should be geared towards reducing people's exposure to toxic air, said a US expert. Speaking at a clean air conclave organised by CSE recently, Kirk R Smith of University of California at Berkeley cited latest research to indicate that health impacts from air pollution could be managed better if the focus was on minimising exposure to pollution sources. Smith, a professor of global environmental health, is adviser to the Union health ministry's steering committee on air pollution, which released its report last year.He shared the results of a PM 2.5 exposure apportionment study conducted for Chennai, which showed that vehicles were responsible for 45% of emissions in the city but contributed to 63% of exposure. /Exposure is assessed through ""intake fraction""-a measurement for the amount of pollution inhaled compared to the amount of pollution emitted from a source. ""The recommendation is to first select the various categories of sources such as vehicles, power plants, waste burning and others and then determine the intake fraction for each source. This will help prioritise the sources. For instance, sources such as power plants are far from people but vehicles are closer to them, so the exposure may be higher in case of vehicles,"" Smith told TOI adding that the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) can study exposure levels by using new tools and research techniques.Linking the odd-even strategy to the larger need to control emissions from all vehicles, Smith said, ""Vehicles have a higher intake fraction (iF). Monitors that are fixed on top of buildings or at an elevation will not be able to capture what people are really breathing. Diesel trucks and cars, for instance, can cause high exposure, emissions from gasoline are not as bad. It's logical that you will want to control emissions from vehicles because there is a large number of people near roadsides and on roads."" Anumita Roy Chowdhury of CSE shared findings from a global study, which found that Delhi's intake fraction from vehicles was way higher than China's, the world average and other Indian metros except Kolkata. The iF from vehicles in Delhi was 100 compared to 150 in Kolkata, 45 in China and 21 in US, the study revealed.Smith stressed the need to adopt an exposure monitoring mechanism in Indian cities, like the one used in California. ""Air pollution damages the immune system. So while pneumonia is caused by bacteria, air pollution makes the immune system weak and vulnerable to pneumonia. It is, of course, linked to chronic lung disease and heart disease,"" he added.The report released by the health ministry panel last year had laid stress on exposure monitoring as well. As of now, the Delhi government is using the information on source apportionment provided by IIT Kanpur.CM Arvind Kejriwal had addressed air pollution experts and NGOs at the the CSE conclave and said that the odd-even scheme was successful in Delhi. CSE, however, suggested that government focus on long-term solutions such as parking restraints. ""The first thing to do is to delimit legal parking area and impose very high penalty when parking rules are flouted,"" Roy Chowdhury added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Toxic fumes from Sec 79 landfill choke residents,"Noida: In a mockery of the National Green Tribunal order, which had banned burning of waste in open, the huge garbage dump in Sector 79 is on fire for the past seven-eight months, filling the air with toxic smoke and forcing nearby residents to stay indoors.According to local residents, the landfill is situated in a densely populated area next to Gaur Sportswood. Recently, 1,047 nearby residents in sectors 75,76,77,78 and 79 filed an online petition against burning of garbage at the landfill. Only in April 2015 that the NGT, in an effort to tackle air pollution, had imposed a complete ban on burning of waste in open including garbage, leaves, plastic & crop residues and had warned that violators would be fined Rs 5,000.""I've seen 35-45 trucks coming daily and dumping the waste which also includes plastic,"" said Inder Preet Singh, a resident of Sector 79. ""The thick smoke from the garbage engulfs the whole area round-the-clock. /This is a clear violation of NGT norms as well as Noida Authority's permissibility rules,"" said Amit Gupta, a resident of sector 78. Since there are no resident welfare assocations in these sectors, since many of them are new, people have started a campaign on their own against the waste dump. In Sector 40, where there is another landfill, the RWA has filed a complaint against burning of garbage.Early this year, after repeated complaints by residents, the Noida Authority sent water tankers to briefly extinguish the fire at the landfill in Sector 79. ""They had promised to continue that till the fire was fully extinguished. But that was not done. And now with the growing severity of heat, the situation is getting worse. Since this is a densely populated area, there cannot be dump yards as per Noida Masterplan,"" said Koushik Maitra, another resident of Sector 78. ""Multiple complaints have been registered with Noida Authority helpline number 0120-2425025 and also with health incharge B N Pokhriyal. In between, Pokhriyal tried to stop burning of waste, but someone started it again,"" said Singh.M P Sharma, project engineer, work circle 6, claimed that the matter comes under horticulture and health departments. He, however, admitted that garbage burning is illegal.""Last week, the garbage and leaves collected by sanitation employees in Sector 40 were found burning. Though the fire was doused by residents, it destroyed even a nearby fully grown tree,"" said Mohinder Singh, executive member, RWA, Sector 40.On Wednesday, a delegation of residents from sectors 76, 77, 78, 79 etc. met Noida Authority chairman Rama Raman and ACEO P K Agarwal. ""We were assured by ACEO Agarwal that the matter will be dealt with soon as they are in the process of shifting the dumpyard to another location,"" said Amit Gupta, who was with the delegation./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Chandigarh-Mohali border filled with smoke and dirt,"Mohali: Rules are being flouted with impunity in the town by burning leaves and garbage at several places. Irked Mohali residents are saying that sightings of burning garbage are a common culture in the town, especially on the border of Chandigarh and Mohali. The residents of both towns tactically throw garbage on the border. /However, Chandigarh has no residential area between the Furniture Market and Phase 2 light point, because of which it is mainly Mohali residents who are suffering from the foul smell.Atul Sharma, resident of Phase 2, said: ""Certainly, the ban on dumping garbage is there, but authorities seem to be least bothered about enforcing the rule. We see sights of garbage every second day in our surroundings, which is totally unhygienic for our health, besides the smoke erupting from burning leaves."" It has been alleged that the contractor of Gmada (Greater Mohali Area Development Authority) and Mohali Municipal Corporation (MMC), instead of taking leaves and garbage into a trolley, and then dumping them properly, burns it at the sight itself to avoid any hassles. Garbage is usually found burning near a park on the border, and also near Nature Park, which has created a mess and plenty of air pollution.Vineet Verma, president of Beopar Mandal, said: ""Thousands of school children come daily to two schools there, and so do thousands of employees to the PSEB (Punjab State Electricity Board) headquarters, while hundreds of devotees come to the Gurduwara Amb Sahib daily, and hundreds of people come for walk in the Nature Park. Many people are burning leaves, causing a lot of pollution, and some employees too, who are officially hired by civic administration, are also burning leaves.""Residents say employees of the contractor time and again burn garbage and other filth, which they bring it on the spot to dump. They alleged that even the leaves and the filth is being burnt illegally here, as the contractor has no written permission from both Gmada and MMC. Residents have approached the civic authorities with a written complaint too, but they are not taking any action against the contractor violating the norms. The site was spotted with leaves and other waste materials like rubber, polythene bags, and other garbage.MMC commissioner Uma Shankar Gupta said: ""We will look into the matter, and whosoever is found guilty will be punished accordingly. Burning leaves and garbage is illegal, and residents are welcome to complain to us via the MMC app, or toll-free numbers, or to the respective officers.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Increased use of diesel gensets causing spike in air, noise pollution","Bareilly: The frequent power cuts in the city have resulted in an increase in the use of diesel generators. Experts said that as more than 15,000 generator sets are now running in the city for over six hours every day, it is causing a significant rise in both air and noise pollution. Besides, as most of the generators have been illegally kept on roadsides, it is causing passers-by also to inhale the toxic gases emitted by them./In summer, the use of generators increases in areas suffering power cuts. The chimney attached to generator sets emit respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), suspended particulate matter (SPM), nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, while the generators without canopy or proper enclosure result in noise pollution./Though the local authorities have conducted no survey to determine the data on pollution caused by diesel generators, experts said that pollution is on the rise because of their excessive use. The generators without canopy which make noise of nearly 80 decibels can be found across the city, including Civil Lines, Choupla, Jawahar Market, Shamatganj and DD Puram. Even many commercial complexes, hospitals, offices and banks have installed generators with capacity of 50 to 100 kilovolt (KV) which lack proper enclosures, causing noise pollution./""In a few residential colonies, including Civil Lines, some offices have come up which have installed big generators causing a rise in noise pollution. However, there is nobody to take action against them,"" said Smiriti Singh, a housewife./DK Saxena, professor emeritus at botany department of Bareilly College who is in-charge of Air Pollution Monitoring Centre in Bareilly said, ""As per World Health Organisation (WHO), the smoke emitted from disease generators is carcinogenic in nature. Besides, the old generators or local-made generators release 200-400 times more pollutants than the current one. Even small generators of capacity of up to 10 KV emit smoke more than the larger ones. Local authorities should check that people are not using old generators which lead to high air pollution.""/When contacted, regional officer, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), RK Tyagi said, ""We are authorised to take action against generator sets installed in industrial areas.""/On being asked who would be taking action against rising pollution levels due to these gensets, Tyagi said, ""Most of the generator sets of commercial complexes have been illegally kept on footpath or roadsides. If they had keep these generators in their own complex, they would be the only ones to inhale the toxic smoke. By keeping it on pavement, the commuters have also been exposed to it. The Bareilly Municipal Corporation should take action against such commercial establishments.""/City health officer, Dr Ashok Kumar said, ""We have a clause of issuing challans if anyone has encroached on pavements, but it is a long process. For conducting a drive, we need help of other government agencies, including officials of UPPCB and administration and police force. However, due to work pressure, we do not get help from these departments. For instance, we got police force for only a day for our anti-polythene drive.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Stress at the workplace may also stress your respiratory tract,"Aurangabad: Scrutiny of patients by some city doctors have revealed that long hours of stressful work in a closed office can induce inflammations in respiratory tracts and cause asthma. Doctors in city said that they are witnessing around 10% patients, in a period of six months, aged between 30 and 35 suffering from stressed-induced asthma. They said that these patients were found free of asthma at the start of the project, but breathing difficulties were reported later when they said work was stressful.City-based pulmonologist Shrikant Sahastrabudhe said, ""Having a stressful job can increase the risk of developing stressed-induced asthma. Employees who find it difficult to leave their problems at the office are much more likely to develop the condition. /As per the observations, I found that work pressure can actually make someone an asthma patient."" ""Since the last six months, my OPD has witnessed a 10% rise in young patients between the age group 30 and 35 complaining of asthma, especially those with no genetic predisposition. Although most sufferers developed asthma in their childhood, significant numbers are now diagnosed as adults, with no family history. The reasons were long working hours, demanding schedules and uncomfortable working conditions,"" he explained.""Stress can lead to the release of chemicals that promote allergies and disrupt the way the body halts inflammation of the airways. The absolute risk of someone developing asthma because they are overloaded at work is still very small, but still cannot be ignored,"" he added.Season-based respiratory tract infections are also being observed in children and adolescents. Former Aurangabad Chest Association president Shrikant Papinwar said, ""Exam-related stress makes already allergy-prone children vulnerable to respiratory infections. Also, following a change in the weather, we are coming across asthma and bronchitis cases. When there is enough sunlight, the pathogens are killed. But when it gets cloudy, there are chances of viruses surviving,"" said Papinwar.""The number of paediatric asthma patients is not only on rise in Aurangabad by 5 to 10% since past five years but the severity of disease is also increasing. There is no physical change in human structure, but the surrounding atmosphere in which we are living is changing rapidly. Pollution level is on rise. Rapid increase in industrialization and more exposure to hazardous pollutants are some of the causes,"" said paediatrician Ganesh Kulkarni.Change in eating habits, eating junk food and cold stuff, use of artificial colours, preservatives and extensive use of chemical pesticides in farming are exposing us to deadly allergies, he said.He advised that parents should ensure that their children take healthy diet and sufficient intake of fluids. Those who have a family history of seasonal allergies, bronchitis and asthma must consult their physician if the child reports of chronic cough not associated with high fever, wheezing and cold which are the common symptoms of cardinal childhood asthma, added Kulkarni.---------------------** What can be done?Initiation of proper management is very important in treating asthma patients. Avoid dusty areas, use mask while driving, regular steam inhalation is also very important.**Asthma causes:- Indoor allergens (for example house dust mites in bedding, carpets and stuffed furniture, pollution and pet dander).- Outdoor allergens (such as pollens and moulds).- Tobacco smoke.- Chemical irritants in the workplace- Air pollution.- Rapid increase in Industrialization, vehicles leading to more exposure to hazardous pollutants. - The intake of artificial products, be it soft drinks or food items.- Increase in stress and strain.---------------**Some common myths: Asthma can be caught from another person. Regular use of inhalers is habit-forming and addictive. Oral medication, - tablets and syrups are better than inhalation therapy. Inhalers are more costly than tablets/syrups. Inhaled medications/inhalers for asthma have steroids and are thus strong and meant only for severe asthma. Asthma comes and goes. It is not always there. You cannot lead a normal life if you have asthma. You cannot exercise and play sports if you have asthma.. Asthma can be caught from another person. A pregnant woman should not take asthma inhalers If ones parents do not have history of asthma one cannot have it. You grow out of asthma or asthma gets better as you get older. An asthma attack comes on suddenly and becomes severe very quickly. Inhaled steroids are only for adult patients who have severe asthma and not for children/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

World Asthma Day: Tips to fight breathlessness,"According to World Health Organization, India has an estimated 15-20 million asthmatics. If data is to be believed, 25 per cent of the Indian population suffers from allergy and 5 per cent of them are suffering from asthma. Also, estimates suggest that by the year 2025, an additionally 100 million people will be asthmatic across the globe./Asthma can affect any age group but it normally starts in early years. Recurrent breathlessness, wheezing are some of the common signs and symptoms, the severity of which can vary from person to person. It occurs due to inflammation of air passages in the lungs and can irritate the nerve endings in the airways. During an asthma attack, the lining of this passage swells, narrowing the airway and reducing air flow in and out of the lungs./While it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of asthma, it is believed that it happens by a combination of both genetic and environmental factors. The saddest part is that asthma cannot be cured but can be controlled./Some asthma reactions are triggered by external allergens such as pollen, dust etc and others occur due to inhalation of certain chemical agents like cigarette smoke or paint vapours. It also worsens at times due to stress or chest infection./Curofy, India's largest community of doctors conducted a poll asking doctors what they thought was the main reason for prevalence of childhood asthma in India. Out of the 1040 doctors who were polled, 82 per cent say that there has been an increased asthma incidence in children due to increased environmental pollution. Also 11 per cent of the doctors polled for second and first hand smoking and 7 per cent chose genetic predilection as the leading cause for increased childhood asthma./Dr Anshum Aneja Arora, consultant W-Pratiksha hospital, Gurgaon says, ""More than a million people are suffering from asthma; it is highly common in all ages. Incidence is on rise because of recent changes in our global environment. Air pollution and particulate dust matters are on rise. It requires regular pulmonary evaluation like spirometry followed by proper medication to prevent further complications.""/Levels of PM 2.5 virus, one of most deadly forms of pollutants recorded in the Delhi air, is 10 times higher than the safety limit prescribed by the World Health Organisation. Much to our dismay, a recent study pointed out that not only outdoor air but indoor air is also highly polluted these days. This is where air purifiers come in. Panasonic air purifiers come with Nanoe technology and Composite air filter (CAF) that inhibit bacteria and viruses and improve air quality. CAF can inhibit 17 kinds of virus, bacteria and allergens up to 99 per cent./A very common myth associated with asthma is that it is not fatal. WHO states that of the 300 million people who suffer from asthma, 25,000 of them died due to the disorder in 2005. This makes it all the more important to fight the condition by altering your lifestyle./Here are some lifestyle changes that can help you keep asthma under control:/Regular exercise: Find the exercise that suits you and take out atleast 30-45 minutes every day to sweat it out./Eat healthy: Have a balanced diet, which is devoid of processed foods. You might also want to check about food allergies./Stay away from polluted areas: Wear masks in polluted areas and stay away from known triggers such as pollen, bird droppings or paint fumes./Quit smoking: If you are an asthmatic, smoking will only worsen the condition,/Pop vitamin pills: You will need vitamins that will up your immune system and ensure that you don't fall prey to cold and cough infections every change of season./Use air purifiers: Air purifiers can help clean the air in your house.

Ways to protect your kids from pollution,"With the increasing perils of widespread pollution all over the city, it becomes almost impossible to stay safe from its harmful effects./Dangers further increase when you live in a city like Delhi which has recently been given the dubious tag of one of the most polluted cities in the world. There is a huge toll of diseases which the residents have to pay by their regressing health. Children are more prone to air borne diseases and thus tend to have severe health implications than adults because their organs are underdeveloped and weak./Talking about the concern, Dr Rajesh Chawla, Apollo Hospitals said, ""There are many common diseases like recurrent nasal discharge and cough which young school going children are seen to be suffering from. This can often lead to the development of bronchial asthma in the later part of their lives. This also results in gradual loss of concentration and hampers their physical and mental growth."" ""Nevertheless, they can fall in the trap of a variety of severe chronic diseases because of the summer heat coupled with the adverse effects of air pollution,"" he added./Dr. Nitin Verma, a senior pediatrician at Max Hospital said that the affects of air pollution can also be seasonal. ""There are high chances of small children being infected by the viruses of conjunctivitis or typhoid. While in the winters, children can probably have serious breathing problems coupled with cold and cough. Other than this, it also affects their overall growth rate. There has been a 40-45% increase in the number of patients carrying restrictive airway diseases in the past 4 to 5 years.""/So what are the ways you can guard your children:/- Avoid getting caught in long traffic jams and if you do, keep your window panes closed./- Use handkerchiefs and glasses to protect their face and eyes./- Make sure they take a bath or rinse their mouth and change their clothes after returning back from outside./- Apart from this, children should avoid playing in areas that are more exposed to smoke emissions./- Avoid walking on busy roads and inhabiting in densely populated and shabby colonies. They can use masks for protecting themselves from diseases and can also make the use of air purifiers and filters for avoiding indoor pollution./- Take your kids to greener areas for fresh air, preferably early in the morning./- Make your kids practice breathing exercises. They will be doubly beneficial if practiced in a cleaner greener place. If not, practice indoors./Mehak Dutta/For more stories, follow us onand/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air pollution, fast food trigger asthma: Experts","Varanasi: Increasing modernization and changes in lifestyle give rise to asthma. Air pollution is also a major cause that triggers it, medical experts said on the occasion of World Asthma Day on Tuesday. The day is observed on the first Tuesday of May. /It is an annual event organized by Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) to improve awareness around the world. This year's theme is 'You can control your asthma.'According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data from September 2015 to January 2016, Varanasi has air quality indices (AQI) value of 409, making it one of the most polluted cities in the country. Changes in lifestyle, junk food and increase in pollution are responsible for asthma.

"'Parents, teachers must know how to deal with asthma cases'","Trichy: The Tamil Nadu Ashthma and Allergy Research Foundation (TAARF) has expressed concern over the ignorance of parents and teachers when it comes to caring for children affected with asthma. On Tuesday, World Asthma Day, the organisation pressed for the need to diagnose asthma in students who are exposed to unhealthy situations. ""People are underestimating the consequences of asthma in children. /Unaware of the infection, children are allowed to use common makeup kits to participate in the dramas and other programmes. These can aggravate their health condition, which may lead to their death if not treated in time,"" said founder of TAARF Dr G Kamal, citing the death of a 17-year-old school girl, Aakriti Bhatia, in Delhi due to the alleged negligence of the school authorities in April 2009.The organisation advised parents to inform teachers about their children's ailment and tell them not to involve such children any activities which will worsen their condition. Dr Kamal insists that ignorance will lead to sad consequences.The organisation cited the increasing pollution in tier-two cities like Trichy as the reason for the rise in such cases. ""Air pollution is on the rise every day due to the increase in the number of vehicles and many other reasons. Hence, it is tough to prevent asthma but we can keep the disease under control with certain measures,"" said Dr Kamal. To mark World Asthma Day, TAARF conducted a medical camp in the Trichy central prison. Among the 243 prisoners who were put through peak flow assessment test, 25 prisoners were diagnosed with symptoms of asthma. Smoking was suspected to be the reason for their ailment. TAARF taught a breathing technique called pulmonary rehabilitation to overcome difficulties in breathing. ""By adopting breathing exercises, patients can reduce medicines and live like normal persons,"" said Dr Kamal.

Construction overtakes vehicles in air pollution,"BHOPAL: Construction work causes more pollution than vehicles in Bhopal, going by yearly ambient air quality monitoring of Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board (MPPCB).Levels of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM10) and particulate matter 2.5, which are mainly on account of dust going in air during construction work are almost three times more at few places than the national ambient air quality standards of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Contrary to general impression that vehicles are the real culprit, there is a drop in pollution over the years. Surprising as 125 new vehicles hit the roads every day in a city, where the number has touched 12 lakh.Air pollution is measured by taking into account level of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air.Cause of SO2 is vehicles. Nox is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage among others. /RSPM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads and PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions.Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is most harmful to health since it goes inside human body and causes severe lung diseases.Sampling locations for air pollution in Bhopal are Hamidia Road, Govindpura, Paryavaran Parisar and Kolar. Hamidia Road is most polluted.In all these places, SO2 and Nox have registered a decline while and RSPM 10 has increased over the years. Officials said value of PM 2.5 is being taken in account in Bhopal since 2015 as a result of which there is no comparative data available for years.As per the national ambient air quality standards, there are seven pollutants measured to find out ambient air quality. They are SO2, Nox, RSPM 10, PM 2.5, ozone, lead, carbon and ammonia. As of now, only SO2, Nox, RSPM 10, PM 2.5 are measured in Madhya Pradesh.Officials said they are in process to start measuring remaining four pollutants and it will be started in near future. As for why vehicular pollution is going down, officials said fuel quantity has been improved over the years. The quantity of lead that would cause pollution has come down in fuel.Secondly, number of new vehicles is increasing, but not old vehicles that cause heavy pollution. Good quality of roads led to better driving conditions, which helped reduce pollution, officials said. MPPCB chief chemist Shyamanuj Tiwari said overall the air pollution in Bhopal is not alarmingly high. Green cover and plantation in the city help keep pollution level in check. Central verge on roads, in particular, with herbs of height up to 5 feet helps absorb the pollution. Level of pollution will be less if there is a proper dispersal. Pollution level goes up in places like Hamidia Road since dispersion on road is not proper there due to which air pollution gets concentrated at one place, he said.Why pollution is not measured in several areas of Bhopal like densely populated Hoshangabad Road, officials said areas are classified under commercial, residential and industrial heads on the basis of activities. For instance, Bagh Sewania is a residential area. Type of activities there will be same like in Arera Colony, the residential area where air quality is monitored on a regular basis./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Lung diseases rise on toxic air,"Ahmedabad: Respiratory disease cases in Gujarat have been skyrocketing over the past few years. A recent report from the Union health ministry has shockingly revealed that in Gujarat, between 2013 and 2015, the number of patients of respiratory diseases grew by more than a lakh each year. While there were a little over 10 lakh such patients in the state in 2013, by 2015, that number neared 14 lakh. /Experts attribute the rapid acceleration in the number of respiratory disease patients to increasing air pollution. According to the report, 10,41,042 cases were registered in 2013 in Gujarat, which increased to 12,49,351 in 2014. In 2015, the state registered 13,69,389 cases of patients suffering from respiratory diseases. This accounts for 3.84% respiratory disease cases registered in India last year. Across India, in 2015, 3,56,50,451 cases of acute respiratory disease had been reported. The report of the Union health ministry also stated that the state has recorded 41,461 cases of tuberculosis in 2015 with 2,172 patients losing their lives.According to experts increasing pollution and particulate matter in the atmosphere can be held responsible for the rising incidence of respiratory diseases, which include asthma, tuberculosis, silicosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a type of obstructive lung disease.Dr Rajesh Solanki, senior pulmonologist at Civil Hospital, said that TB and asthma are spreading in the state.""Pollution and dust particles are the most common factors that contribute in increasing respiratory diseases. Air pollution, mainly due to industrial and untreated chemical effluent vapours in the air, is the most common reason behind the rampant increase in respiratory problems,"" Solanki said.Solanki further added that they have conducted a study in 12 cities of Gujarat in which it was found that people living in urban areas, especially in slums, are more susceptible to respiratory diseases.""In urban slums, lack of ventilation increases cases of COPD and asthma. Children and elderly people are the biggest sufferers,"" Solanki said.He said that labourers working in silica industry suffer from silicosis, in which patients, after developing acute respiratory problems, often die at the age of 30 to 35.Dr Sandip Malhan, superintendent of AMC-run VS hospital, said that apart from the increasing pollution level, the changing pattern of weather is also responsible for the spike in respiratory diseases./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

But the Ahmedabad traffic police are dragging their feet in its implementation. Just formulating rules and hiking fines without effective enforcement will take us back a decade when Ahmedabad was the most polluted city in the country. Though there are rules in place to phase out old diesel trucks and other vehicles, there is no proactive move to take them off the streets. Other major contributors, like the smouldering Pirana garbage dump and polluting industrial clusters, largely remain unchecked./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Delhi no more the most polluted city in the world, says WHO report","NEW DELHI: Delhi is not the most polluted city in the world any more, according to the World Health Organisation's (WHO) urban air quality database released on Thursday.In fact, it now ranks 11th among 3,000 cities in 103 countries in terms of PM 2.5 (fine, particulate pollution) and 25th in terms of PM 10 (coarse pollution particles) levels. This is though a considerable improvement since 2014 when Delhi was ranked the most polluted city in terms of PM 2.5 levels, WHO had monitored only 1600 cities last time. This time 1400 more cities have been included in the database.Zabol in Iran is the most polluted city in the world according to the database. Gwalior and Allahabad are a close second and third in terms of PM 2.5, which is associated with more serious health impacts than PM 10. Patna and Raipur rank 6th and 7th. /Totally, four Indian cities are among the world's ten most polluted cities, 10 out top 20 are also in India. In WHO's 2014 report, 13 out of 20 most polluted cities were in India.Delhi's annual PM 2.5 mean for 2013 (second half) is 122 micrograms per cubic metres according to WHO's latest report compared to 153 micrograms per cubic metres as per WHO's previous report. Delhi's annual mean is about three times the Indian safe standard and 12 times the WHO standard of 10 micrograms per cubic metres. Chinese cities Xintai and Baoding are at ninth and 10th in the ranking, Beijing ranks far below at 56th. Beijing was at 75th last time. Sinclair in US is the least polluted city with an annual mean of only 2 micrograms per cubic metres.WHO used data from various government and research organisations for the database, it's based on ground measurements of annual mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5) and ""aims at representing an average for the city or town as a whole, rather than for individual stations. Years of measurements range from 2010 to 2015, unless the latest available data was older,"" the report said.Experts saidmay have reflected in the improvement in ranking. Some however also raised an interesting point - WHO has been mainly focusing on particulate matter (PM) but not so much on oxides of nitrogen (NOx) which is a problem in many parts of the West. ""To get a more accurate and balanced picture of air quality globally, WHO should have taken NOx in to account too. NOx levels are in high in many parts of Europe too,"" said an expert.Global trends since 2008 show air pollution levels have gone up by 8% despite improvements in many cities. WHO in its statement also said urban air pollution levels were lowest in high-income countries, with lower levels most prevalent in Europe, the Americas, and the Western Pacific Region but highest in low-and middle-income countries in eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia Regions, with annual mean levels often exceeding 5-10 times WHO limits.""It is crucial for city and national governments to make urban air quality a health and development priority,"" said WHO's Dr Carlos Dora. ""When air quality improves, health costs from air pollution-related diseases shrink, worker productivity expands and life expectancy grows. Reducing air pollution also brings an added climate bonus, which can become a part of countries' commitments to the climate treaty,"" he added. During the World Health Assembly, between 24-30 May, member states will discuss a road map for an enhanced global response to the adverse health effects of air pollution.""Delhi has improved. Ahmedabad has stabilized and Patna has worsened. We have seen that Delhi has managed to arrest the declining air quality trend in 2015. Air policy action has started kicking in - with an environment compensation charge on on trucks, action against other sources. We are responding to action but the levels are still very high in the city, it only shows that action has to be sustained to meet clean targets,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).""I am not surprised that four Indian cities are in the top ten list. In 2014, 13 out of top 20 cities were from India. Our fossil fuel consumption has increased since then. In India there are also multiple sources of particulate matter emissions that need to be addressed urgently like industries, thermal power plants, and biomass burning. The environment ministry has recently announced standards for thermal power plants. That's a welcome solution but we need an action plan now and will have to move away from a fossil fuel dependent economy,"" said Sunil Dahiya, campaigner with Greenpeace India./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Five from Raj feature in list of world's most polluted cities,"Jaipur: Among the most polluted cities in the world, Rajasthan has five in the list hinting at the deteriorating air quality in the state. According to World Health Organization's (WHO) urban air quality database released on Thursday, Jodhpur ranks 30th most polluted city in the world followed by Jaipur at 33rd position.Apart from two, Kota (58), Udaipur (59) and Alwar (61) are also among the polluted cities in the world. Air quality of 3,000 cities in 103 countries were surveyed by the WHO and is based on ground measurements of annual mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5). Out of 122 cities in India where air pollution data was measured, Jodhpur recorded 101 micrograms per cubic meter as its annual PM 2.5 mean and is 13th most polluted. /Jaipur with 100 micrograms per cubic meter is 15th in the country. Both cities annual mean is about 10 times the WHO standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meters. Including Kota, Udiapur and Alwar, Rajasthan has five cities in the top 25 populated cities in the country.In terms of air pollution PM 2.5, is associated with more serious health impacts than PM 10. It consists of fine, particulate pollution which damages respiratory system more intensely than PM 10 which have coarse pollution particles. ""With rise in air pollution, the obstructive airway diseases are on the rise. Every year it is increasing 10-15% in Jaipur. It also causes allergic conjunctivitis and among children allergic rhinitis is the reason of air pollution,"" said Narendra Khippal, doctor and professor, institute of respiratory diseases, SMS Medical College. Rajasthan being a tourist state has a pressing need to improve its air quality. Tourists worldwide these days plan their itinerary based on air quality index. With dismal record it is likely that state will lose on its foreign travelers to destinations with better air quality. Global trends since 2008 show air pollution levels have gone up by 8% despite improvements in many cities. WHO in its statement also said urban air pollution levels were lowest in high-income countries, with lower levels most prevalent in Europe, the Americas, and the Western Pacific Region but highest in low-and middle-income countries in eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia Regions, with annual mean levels often exceeding 5-10 times WHO limits./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Chhattisgarh capital Raipur 7th most polluted in world: WHO,"Raipur: Chhattisgarh capital Raipur has earned the dubious distinction of being among seventh top polluted cities in the world-relegating Delhi to the eleventh spot-but the only solace is that the situation of air pollution here is better than Gwalior, Allahabad and Patna as per a World Health Organisation (WHO) report.This is for the second consecutive time that WHO's urban air quality data base figures puts Raipur on highly polluted cities map. In 2014, WHO data concluded that Raipur was the third worst city in India as the city found its way in the list of top 20 polluted cities in the world.Raipur has overshadowed Delhi--earlier tagged as most polluted city- ranking seventh in the list of top twenty most polluted cities in the world with 144 microgram per cubic metres recorded in PM2.5 levels while Delhi ranks eleventh on the list. Scarier was Madhya Pradesh's Gwalior city that ranks second in the list after Zabol in Iran with PM25 levels touching 176 microgram per cubic metre while Allahabad stood third and Patna rests at sixth rank.Environmentalists insist that urgent steps are required to improve air quality with PM 10 level on an average record, 280 to 300 micrograms per cubic metres against the annual prescribed average of 60 micrograms per cubic metre. Survey reports suggest that vehicular emission is the major source of pollution in Raipur that contributes to 55 per cent to atmosphere while it is the industry and bio-mass burning and construction that leads to chronic respiratory and skin diseases among the citizens.According to officials at traffic department, out of nearly 12 lakh registered vehicles in Raipur, over half of them are more than 10 years old and about 1.5 lakh vehicles adding to traffic every year. /Experts suggest regulating old vehicles as they emit maximum carbon in air and steps were urgently required to introduce CNG vehicles.When contacted member secretary Chhattisgarh Environment Control Board (CGECB) Devendra Singh said that he was yet to see the WHO report while the Board's jurisdiction is limited to industries only.However, Singh elaborated on the steps being taken to reduce air pollution. Though several steps are taken to spread awareness for controlling pollution, Pollution Board has recently asked IIT Khadagpur and IIT Mumbai to audit the pollution levels at all parameters in worst four polluted cities of Chhattisgarh including Raipur, Raigarh, Korba and Janjgir-Champa. The work has been initiated and based on the reports submitted; Board will prepare projects to solve the problem. It would be a comprehensive survey that would cover emissions from industries, vehicles, bio-medical waste etc,"" Singh said.Shamsh Pervez, an environment researcher and professor in Pt. Ravi Shankar Shukla University told TOI that it was high time for state government to take the issue seriously or else the new generations in Raipur are surely going to suffer most with several health ailments.According to a study 'Aerosol and air quality research' conducted by Pervez , vehicular pollution contributes maximum of up to 55% to environment that includes traffic, and bad roads, while 22-38% was industrial emission, 12-18% was contributed by biomass burning (household solid fuels, waste and 8-11% real estate construction activities, he said.Pervez elaborates, ""The prescribed safe limit for annual mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5) is 60 microgram per cubic meter and 40 microgram per cubic meter while in his research Raipur has shockingly recorded PM10 between 280-300 microgram per cubic meter and PM2.5 from 190-210 microgram per cubic meter.""PM 10 and PM2.5 are the small, fine particulate matters that settles in lungs and bronchi, enters respiratory tract and disrupts breathing and cause health problems.Shamsh advocates that it's time for government to start using CNG in their own vehicles first and then implement it in public transport vehicles specially auto-rickshaws and eventually make it mandatory for all. While many vehicles on road are more than ten years old, they emit maximum carbon in environment, should be consciously banned.In Raipur the organic (brown) and elemental (black) carbon's joint percentage in atmosphere is 30% which is double than other cities and is which takes the city to another hazardous stage of health ailment, like chronic asthma, respiratory and skin diseases. Chhattisgarh has been recording 100 percent increase in respiratory diseases in last few years due to huge bacterial and allergens concentration in atmosphere, besides, extreme heat, less rain, we are heading towards becoming a dry region.Expressing opinion in this report, Anunita Roy Chowdhury, executive director Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said, ""Raipur certainly continues to figure in top ten most polluted cities in the country with disturbing is PM 2.5 levels increased by 7 percent since last WHO's published report.""This clearly indicates pollution is a serious issue in Raipur with contrasting change in opposite trend of further worsening. This is worse than Delhi where it recovered due to strong public awareness, pressure from apex court and other factors we need to implement similar factors in Raipur too"", she added.Experts suggest following solutions:Vehicular PollutionIt's time for government to start using CNG in their own vehicles first and then implement it in public transport vehicles specially auto-rickshaws and eventually make it mandatory for all, says experts. While many vehicles on road are more than ten years old, they emit maximum carbon in environment, should be consciously banned.IndustriesIn terms of industries, it's mainly small scale sponge iron plants in Urla-Siltara area that can't afford pollution control equipment. Proper monitoring of big industries and closure of smaller ones that violate pollution norms should be closed.Effective monitoring to check whether industries around Raipur are using electrostatic precipitators (ESP) to check air pollution.Biomass burningWhile Supreme Court has already banned biomass burning, 61% of households in urban areas still use and depend upon kerosene and solid fuels for cooking and other use against the national average of 23%. Accessibility of LPG stoves at lower rates to these poor households would bring down pollution level to great extent.Real EstateFor real estate the only solution could be closed construction by covering the site from all sides and using mixtures instead of manually mixing stuff. Moreover, departments of traffic, PHE, civic body and PWD should be made stakeholders to participate in conserving environment./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Industrial hubs health risk for residents,"High air pollution levels in Ludhiana and Mandi Gobindgarh are taking a toll on the health of residents, even as the authorities are turning a blind eye to the problem. Studies have pointed out that the poor ambient air quality is not only aggravating ailments like asthma and allergies, but also contributing to morbidity due to respiratory diseases./Two separate studies conducted by Dr Manoj Kumar of the Centre for Public Health, Panjab University, have tried to quantify the impact of pollution on the health of people in the state's two industrial hubs. ""The adult population of Mandi Gobindgarh was found to have significantly more chronic respiratory morbidity, as compared to that of a non-industrial town like Morinda. It was concluded that the pollution in ambient air is responsible for the poor respiratory health of adults in Mandi Gobindgarh. The ultrafine particles are getting further affected by increasing vehicular density, gaseous and material objects from the haphazard growth of industry,"" he said./The study had also looked at health ailments like cough, phlegm, wheeze, and chronic bronchitis. ""Vehicular pollution was an equally big factor in the case of Ludhiana, and it was found that people living along major roads in the city were found to have more respiratory problems. Overall, air pollution emerged as a major factor in the morbidity rate of the city,"" he added./In the case of Mandi Gobindgarh, a separate study was done by Dr Shalini Gupta of Desh Bhagat University, along with her colleagues. ""Air pollution adversely affects human health in the sub-tropical climatic conditions of northern India. Breathing has become difficult due to excessive smoke billowing out of chimneys, with the soot dirtying the clothes of residents and travelers. Vehicles plying on National Highway No.1, and on city roads have added heavily to the town's carbon footprint. The dust particles in the air causes problems in breathing. This dust is from the construction work on National Highway No 1, and from the construction of buildings and bridges,"" says the study. ""Moving trucks and other vehicles also raise a lot of dust, since the work on various roads is not yet complete, and the vehicles move on unmetalled tracks. The scrap used for making ingots is also another cause of dust. Even in rural areas, some industries were throwing out smoke in large quantities, which spreads like a cloud towards most of the surrounding villages. In these villages, fires in the fields caused by stubble burning create highly toxic gases, heat, smoke, and soot.The soot and smoke are toxic by nature,"" adds the study./Cycle city falling victim to vehicles/Apart from being the most industrialized city of Punjab, Ludhiana is known for its maddening traffic that has registered growth at 4% and it has not just resulted in frequent jams, it is choking city residents./Latest ranking of most polluted cities of the world by WHO puts Ludhiana at the 12th place.

Cantonment board alleges 'sabotage' in week-long blaze at dumping ground,"Pune: The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) has claimed that the almost week-long fire at its Hadapsar waste disposal grounds may be a deliberate act. The board has planned an overhaul to reduce the quantity of waste at the grounds. A six-day blaze at the disposal facility in Hadapsar industrial estate was finally put out last Sunday. /It had sent plumes of smoke into the air and foul odour in the area. The presence of inflammable material in the waste and the heat had made it difficult to put out the blaze, officials added. The PCB had to seek assistance from the Army, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), and from the other Cantonment boards to put the blaze out. PCB officials said the exact cause of the blaze has not been determined. They have 'enough reasons' to suspect foul play.""The Hadapsar disposal grounds have been rented by the PCB for more than 100 years. The land is on a prominent location, and for long the local builder lobby has been eyeing it for development. But they have been unable to do so. I suspect the fire at the grounds was deliberate, and it was set by people who want to take over these grounds for construction,"" Dilip Giramkar, PCB vice president, said.The 27-acre disposal grounds have been used by the PCB since 1908 and rented from a private entity. The grounds themselves have been a source of contention, with residents frequently seeking its removal through public interest litigations or representations, over poor management and air pollution. However, Giramkar said this time, it is the builders who are ""playing up"" the blaze to have it their way.""The local builders lobby has been creating a huge hue and cry about the fire so that they can gain control of the property,"" he added.Worried about the ground's future, the PCB has said that it is overhauling the waste management system to reduce the huge quantities of refuse to avoid fires and to reduce local complaints about pollution.""We have already floated a tender to construct a solid waste treatment plant at the site. In addition, we will work on improving the vermicomposting facilities to reduce the amount of refuse. We will engage retired engineers of the PCB to oversee that operation,"" CEO Sanjeev Kumar said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Trichy 2nd most polluted city in TN: WHO survey,"Coimbatore: According to the new global urban ambient air pollution ranking released by WHO on Thursday, Chennai is the most polluted city in Tamil Nadu with a global ranking of 314. The state capital is followed by Trichy (370) and Coimbatore (410). The ranking was based on the levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) calculated after monitoring ambient air quality in 3,000 urban areas in 103 countries.The survey was undertaken to highlight that air pollution was responsible for more than three million premature deaths worldwide every year.Environmentalist K Mohanraj said the increase in particulate matter can be attributed to bad road conditions. ""Vehicles move slower in comparison to previous years and the slow pace increase emissions,"" he said. Pending construction projects and reduced tree cover may also be a reason, he added.Air quality monitors said the reason behind analyzing particulate matter in air was because it was tiny and the particles easily enter into the lungs. Several diseases such as respiratory ailments, heart problems, brain tumours and cancer are caused by it. ""Number of vehicles has increased and inhaling these particles causes chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. These kinds of diseases do not respond much to drugs,"" said Dr R Vani, pulmonologist and working in Coimbatore Medical College & Hospital./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'No development if no war on pollution',"New Delhi: Michael P Pelletier, the charge d'affaires of the US embassy, said promoting development and combating air pollution were the two sides of the same coin and that there was no conflict between the two. ""Without one, you cannot have the other."" Pelletier was speaking at the launch of a series of Indo-US collaborative workshops on air pollution in north India on Tuesday./The two countries had announced a joint initiative to reduce air pollution during President Obama's visit to Delhi last January. Tuesday's workshop was one of the first such collaborative attempts. Similar workshops will be held in Chandigarh, Lucknow and Jaipur over the next few days./Pelletier said for long, people had been considering development and controlling air pollution to be dissonant ideas. He added that it was time India realised the huge losses it might be facing because of air pollution. He cited the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate's report, which estimated the economic costs of air pollution. ""Losses due to premature death from air pollution alone, not including the costs of healthcare or the losses associated with the grinding suffering of chronic disease, are almost 6% of the GDP, which nearly cancel out India's strong rate of economic growth,"" Pelletier said./He added US dealt with air pollution during a phase of unparalleled economic growth. In the subsequent decades after the implementation of air pollution laws, the US economy grew fourfold, while pollution levels fell to a quarter of what they were in the 1960s. ""This sustained investment to improve air quality and protect public health has led to handsome dividends. Every dollar the government invested to implement the Clean Air Act has generated $30 dollars in benefits. In sum, the Clean Air Act has yielded $2 trillion in benefits, almost all of them related to lives saved, diseases avoided, and worker productivity boosted,"" Pelletier added./Speaking on the occasion, Delhi's health minister Satyendar Jain said India was emulating ""bad things"" from the US. ""We are trying to compete with them in consumption. Let's consume less. Now, anyone who gets a job takes a loan to buy a car first. This when Delhi has more cars than Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata together."" Jain said. The minister added that the Delhi government would give priority to pedestrians, followed by cyclists and public transport. ""If there is space, then cars will ply. We will cover open soil along 1,260 kms of roads with plants.""/The workshops will have scientists, doctors and policy experts discussing the air pollution problem who will come up with suggestions on the follow-up action. They are being organised by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International, in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi./Pelletier commended the Centre for advancing the implementation of BS VI norms to 2020.

"Cooking with biomass fuel increases chances of getting cataract, says study","Madurai: Women who cook with biomass fuel are more likely to get cataract when compared to those who user cleaner fuel like LPG for cooking, according to a study conducted by Aravind Eye Hospitals, Madurai and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Addressing mediapersons here on Wednesday, Dr R D Ravindran, chairman, Aravind Eye Care System said the four year (2004-2008) study was published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, a publication of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, (NIEHS), National Institutes of Health, US department of health and human services.The study, funded by Welcome Trust, interviewed nearly 6,000 people aged about 60 chosen randomly from villages and small towns in north and south India. The sample population was interviewed on its cooking fuel and on a range of socio-economic and lifestyle factors. /A week after they were interviewed, the participants were examined in hospital for their eye condition including lens photography and 40% of them were found to have visually impairing nuclear cataracts.It was found that 65% of the participants used biomass fuel, while 32% used LPG and 3% kerosene. Many of them said they had used only biomass fuel in their early age, in mud stoves without chimneys.In addition to other risk factors like poor nutrition, exposure to sun, smoking and chewing tobacco, researchers found that women who cooked using biomass fuel were 46% more likely to get cataract when compared to those who used LPG. The more they used biomass fuel, the more their cataract risk. If they had used firewood for 20 years, they had 50% chances of getting it while using biomass for 30 years increased the risk to 90 per cent.The poorer the population the more the use of biomass and recent estimates show that 83% of rural households and 19% of urban households still use it as a mode of cooking. Cooking in open stoves exposed the people to health damaging pollutants which could impair the eye's defence system and accelerate clouding of the lens.Co-ordinator of the study, Prof Astrid Fletcher of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that India had the highest level of cataract and that it was higher in women than men and their study had proved the same. Household air pollution from combustion of solid fuels has been ranked as the second global cause for disability adjusted life years and of reduced life expectancy in south Asia. The researchers said that there is an urgent need to create awareness and also replace biomass cooking with cleaner cooking fuels, for the benefit of the population./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Bio-mass burning leads to air pollution in Patna,"PATNA: ""An overwhelming 1.38 lakh households in Patna still rely on solid fuel and traditional cook stoves for domestic cooking despite their negative impact on health. This dependency on solid fuel results into enormous emission of particulate matter (PM) and putting people's health at risk. The predominance of health complaints such as eye irritation, visual impairment, watery eyes, muscles fatigue and respiratory problems were observed"", says a Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) report on cooking practices in Patna titled as ""Air pollution begins at home"".The survey was conducted in Patna Urban Ammologeration Area (PUAA). The entire survey was done in 18 cluster of 11 places in PUAA area. /The total sample size was 580. A lot community focused group discussion was also conducted. The survey was conducted between February and March, 2016.The area that were surveyed are- Isapur, airport Area, Hardaspura, Purania, AIIMS area, Lal kothi, Pipa Pul, Gajhadhar chowk, Durja, Digha area, Binda toli, Gaighat, Karma singh Nahar, Sharifganj, kamla Nehru Nagar, Punaichak and Boring road.The report advocates for serious and urgent efforts for transition to cleaner/sustainable forms of energy in Patna.While releasing the report here on Friday, Ramapati Kumar, chief executive officer (CEO) of CEED said, ""Inefficient cooking stoves lead to toxic smoke which creates environmental health risk. Women and children are exposed to toxic chemicals. Burning of solid fuels emits complex mix of pollutants, mainly PM and black carbon. It's shocking to witness that large number of households in Patna still depends on solid fuel"".Kumar said that the Bihar government should implement stronger actions to transform existing cooking practices for safe and healthy lifestyle.Presenting the findings of report, Ankita Jyoti, CEED programme manager, said that it was observed that 72% of Women and children are at higher risk. The report represents a dismal situation of air pollution in Patna associated with usage of bio mass for cooking. It is estimated that 831.54 tons of toxics PM and 232 tons of black carbon is added in the atmosphere, Jyoti revealed.The report also projects a trend of pollution which can reach to 1.32 lakh tons of (PM 2.5 ) by 2051. ""Bihar faces a historic moment as the government promised total electrification by 2017 but clean and safe methods of cooking from better fuels is given a little attention in the state"", said CEO Kumar.""We need to declare a war on traditional methods of cooking to safeguard women's health. It requires a system that collates technological up gradation, implementation plans, monitoring strategies and clear timelines to phase-out the bio-mass from cooking, he said.CEED demanded the state government to phase out dirty fuel from cooking to safeguard the health of women and children and a combination of technology depending on adoptability, affordability and potential should be encouraged to smoothen the transition./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Tiny specks that wreak havoc on citizens' health,"Lucknow: Smaller the particle, bigger the harm it does to health of anyone who breathes it in. Sore eyes, sudden coughing or running nose in the middle of traffic are indication of deteriorating quality of air we breathe. Lucknow mostly ranks high on air pollution data all year round and its air has shown presence of particles several times smaller than PM (particulate matter) 2.5, measuring as small as PM0.10 and PM0.056./Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR), a CSIR lab based in Lucknow found presence of nano-pollutant PM1 (ranging from 0.3 micro meter to 1.0 micro meter) , in Lucknow's air in the post-Diwali air quality assessment in 2014. But when it took up the first planned monitoring of nano-pollutants in the city's air in October 2015, the size of pollutants were even smaller. ""In case of PM10 we can say it contains nickel and lead but we don't know the chemical constitution of ultrafine and superfine particles,"" said IITR scientists./""The source could be vehicular emission, burning of solid waste, construction or any other,"" said sources. Out of three monitoring locations, Parivartan Chowk (commercial), Gomtinagar (residential) and Gehru campus, IITR (rural), commercial and residential locations reported higher concentration of superfine particulate matter./According to Greenpeace India, ""PM2.5 caused over 3million premature deaths in 2010. The international agency for research on cancer classified particulate matter pollution as carcinogenic in 2013 and designated it as a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths."" In Lucknow, population exposed to PM2.5 is very high./""Particulate matter is generated mostly by industries and vehicles,"" said Sunil Dahiya, campaigner, Greenpeace India. Though fuel-efficient vehicles don't release soot anymore, ultrafine particles are emitted in much higher concentration, compunding the problem./Vehicles crawling at a snail's pace cause more fuel to burn and pollute air as much as power cuts and increased use of diesel generator sets. Pollutants emitted by petrol engine include oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur along with hydrocarbons and lead. If the smoke has more than 3% CO concentration, the vehicle will pollute air. In case of diesel vehicles, smoke density causes pollution. If density of smoke emitted by the vehicle is more than 65 Hartridge Smoke Unit (HSU), the vehicle should be seized for causing pollution. While '0' HSU means smoke is invisible, 100 HSU means smoke is thick and opaque. Even CNG vehicles are not emission free. A CSIR study done in Delhi found nano carbon particles in exhaust of CNG buses./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
?City dwellers continue to breathe polluted air,"MEERUT: City dwellers continue to breathe polluted air. A disturbing trend has emerged in the city based on data collected by the Pollution Control Board (PCB) over the years. In the past five years, respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in the atmosphere has increased by more than 50%./RSPM is particulate matter which is readily inhaled by human beings through their respiratory system and its density in the atmosphere is a measure of air pollutants in the air of a particular area./As per data, in 2011, the quantity of RSPM at Begum Bridge crossing was measured as 124.3 microgram per cubic meter, which was 24% more than the permissible limit of 100. After a gradual increase every year, the level stands at 186.7 microgram per cubic meter this year, which shows an increase of 66% from 2011 figures and 86% more than the permissible limit./According to assistant scientist at PCB, Pawan Mishra, ""Pollutants in the increased RSPM directly affect lungs as they get deposited there and lead to respiratory problems.""/Dr Veerottam Tomar, a pulmonologist, said, ""When pollutants enter the lungs, they work as irritants that trigger the formation of phlegm in the walls of lungs. Consequently, the body is unable to release toxins like carbon dioxide and this leads to drowsiness in acute cases. Even the nose and tips of nails start turning blue in those circumstances, and patients have to be admitted to the intensive care unit. These pollutants also trigger attacks of bronchial asthma.""/Besides, air pollution, water pollution is also playing havoc with the lives of city residents. Toxic industrial effluents flowing in the Kali River have contaminated the groundwater in dozens of villages and localities located near the banks of the river, which passes through the district. For instance, hundreds of residents of Saini village in Meerut are suffering from skin diseases and cancer./Noise pollution, too, is gradually increasing in the city owing to traffic mismanagement and frequent jams. Data provided by the PCB reveals that almost all areas in the city witnessed higher levels of noise pollution./For instance Begum Bridge, Thapar Nagar and Shastri Nagar experience close to 80 decibels, while Railway Road and Cantonment witness 65 decibels./According to health experts, the ideal limit is not more than 45-50 decibels./Ankur Gupta, ENT specialist, told TOI, ""Ideally, the human ear should not be subjected to more than 50 decibels. Hence, 80 is certainly on the higher side and the ear should not be exposed to such high frequency continuously for more than an hour. After than the damage start occurring.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air too polluted to breathe safe in Aurangabad,"AURANGABAD: Move over Delhi's choking levels of pollution, the air back home in Aurangabad is just as much hazardous. A study conducted by two city scientists, in association with National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), has revealed an alarming 14 out of 17 zones in Aurangabad to have high levels of pollution. The average concentration of PM10 (particulate matter) ranged between 82.1 to 343.9 microgram per metric cube (\xB5g/m3). According to WHO guidelines, the recommended level of PM10 in urban areas should be less than 20 \xB5g/m3. The figures aren't far behind New Delhi's pollution levels, which, at 470 \xB5g/m3, make one of the most lethal air to breathe in. Scientist and environmentalist Geetanjali Kaushik and Arvind Chel, who did his post-doctoral fellowship in thermal engineering from Ghent University, Belgium, published the results of a two-month-long study in the International Journal of Environment recently. /Their paper, titled 'Ambient air and PM10 respirable dust concentration and control strategies for Aurangabad', is the first ever such study done for the city. Both are professors at the city-based JNEC college of engineering. ""There are gradations of pollution levels. The scales for PM 10, according to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, are classified into standard (0-100 \xB5g/m3), controllable (100-200 \xB5g/m3), alarming (200-300 \xB5g/m3) and worst (300-400 \xB5g/m3). We conducted the study in 17 prime locations in the city and included five major industrial zones within a 20-km radius,"" said Kaushik.PM10 refers to particles less than or equal to 10 micrometres in diameter, less than the width of a single human hair. This excludes larger particles like soot and ash, which is easily seen by the naked eye, but includes the coarse dust particles which are 2.5-10 micrometres in diameter. These particles can easily get into the lungs, and can potentially cause several health problems and respiratory ailments. ""Busy areas of the city like the railway station, City Chowk recorded the most dangerous levels of pollution: recording a lethal 300-500 \xB5g/m3 of particulate matter. Zones which reported alarming levels include Waluj MIDC area, Beed Bypass, Bus stand-CIDCO, Seven Hill Crossing, Gajanan Mandir, Dudh Dairy Crossing, Kranti Chowk, Mill Corner, S B College, Gulmandi, Harsul Crossing and TV Centre. Chikalthana MIDC area and the city airport showed readings between 100 to 200 \xB5g/m3, which is controllable,""said Chel. Kaushik added that the PM10 concentration has rarely been monitored according to the land use pattern for Aurangabad city. They took the readings using the respirable dust sampler developed through collaboration of NEERI-CSIR. Only one location in the city was a literal breath of fresh air. ""The MGM campus showed PM10 levels at 82.1\xB5g/m3, which can be regarded as standard. This was possibly because of the widespread greenery in the campus. One of the sure-fire ways to ensure that the air you breathe in is safe for you is to plant trees and maintain them,"" Chel said. But the rest of the city, they warned, is definitely in the danger zone. ""There are serious issues of respirable fine particulate matter (PM) in the ambient air in India. It is estimated that about 670 million people comprising 54.5% of population in India reside in regions of serious growing problems of air pollution and suspended dust particles. Numerous studies in the past had revealed a consistent correlation between the particulate matter concentration, human health and mortality. Aurangabad is one of the rapidly growing city in India with population of 1.5 million and surrounded by five major industrial areas within 20 km range. The city has historical monuments like Ajanta and Ellora Caves, Bibi Ka Maqbara, which are adversely affected from air pollution,"" said Kaushik.Suggesting control measures be implemented as soon as possible, Chel said, ""The present study was of a short duration. It is important to develop a comprehensive monitoring network to provide more accurate information regarding the particulate load, especially in highly populated and congested areas.""""As a control measure for PM emissions, the city should promote use of cleaner fuels like CNG, widen major roads, improve the road conditions, pave footpaths for pedestrians, bypass heavy vehicles and buses passing through the city and make one-way traffic at the narrow heavy traffic roads in the city,"" he added. MGM Medical College and Hospital deputy dean, Pravin Suryavanshi said, ""Automobiles, industries, waste and biomass open burning and dusty footpath create re-suspension of road dust. PM has been implicated in various respiratory, cardio-pulmonary diseases and even cancer. Therefore, clean air should be the city's focus for economic growth with regard to benefits of longer lives and fewer incidences of PM related sickness. Also people who survive longer are able to contribute to the Indian economy for more years.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
The 'macro' side of micro particles,"Lucknow: Against a daily requirement of 2kg food and three litres water, an adult inhales and exhales about 7-8 litres air every minute. And only 20% of it is oxygen. This explain how air pollution kills 5.5 million persons prematurely a year. Particulate matter (PM1) is to blame for a large chunk of these deaths. Chest ailments experts in city are now worried about the trend./""Nano pollutant PM1 makes lungs more vulnerable to pollution and its ills,"" said pulmonary expert Dr B P Singh, who works for prevention of lung diseases as well. He added that though no study had been conducted in Lucknow, PM1 can add to the burden of COPD, bronchitis, besides risk of lung cancer./Chest experts in the city predicted an increase of 10% in cases of asthma, chronic bronchitis and COPD because to PM1. PM suspended in the air and inhaled through the nasal airway get trapped in the nose and upper respiratory track./Particles sized 2.5 to 10 microns reach the trachea down to lower airways and lungs. PM1 goes to deepest parts of the lung where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the blood stream./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Gasping for clean air,"The health hazards of breathing in polluted air can no longer be ignored. We need to realise that air pollution is invisible but insidious./India has the dubious distinction of bagging 10 slots in the global top 20 list for the cities with the most polluted air as per the 2016 World Health Organisation (WHO) report on urban ambient air quality. India's air is heavily polluted, with more than 95 per cent of Indians across the country breathing in air that is polluted by gases, tiny particles and heavy metals. The pollution in all these cases is well above the levels recommended by the WHO. And the problem is not restricted to the metros alone. Smaller Indian cities are equally polluted./Our monitoring capacity is still struggling top even accurately measure the pollution levels on a regular basis. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) as yet monitors PM2.5 in only 17 cities across India. Part of the problem is the fact that air pollution is now more invisible than ever. Dense black smoke is no longer spewing forth from vehicles, power plants and industrial units. So we think the air is clean. It is not; the pollutants are invisible but deadly./The pollutants include gases like Nitrogen oxide (Nox), which causes smog and acid rain.It is produced from burning fuels including petrol, diesel, and coal.Nitrogen oxides can make children susceptible to respiratory diseases in winters. The other category of pollutants includes particulate matter (PM). This consists of solids in the air in the form of smoke, dust, and vapour, etc., all of which can remain suspended for extended periods. PM is also the main source of haze which reduces visibility./The finer of these particles, when breathed in can lodge in our lungs and cause lung damage and respiratory problems. And the most damaging of these are PM10 and PM2.5./The smallness of their size is what makes them lethal. PM1o, i.e., particles smaller than 10 micrometers in diameter can pass through our throat and nose and affect our heart and lungs. Finer particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) or 130th of the average width of a human hair are an even bigger health hazard as they lodge themselves deep into the lungs. And then there are the ultrafine particles smaller than 0.1 micrometre that can enter our blood stream. These can act as carriers of highly toxic chemical mixtures. All these pollutants in the air add up to a respiratory health burden that spans generations. Children at much greater risk because their lungs are still developing while being exposed to air that damages their lungs. But the health hazards of air pollution do not stop at respiratory problems--they also include (as studies around the world have shown) cardiac problems, diabetes, hypertension, low birth weight, cancer, and an impact on foetal development./Air pollution till now has been the silent pollutant. But no longer. The state's air crisis did have the effect of starting a national conversation on air pollution. It is time to take that awareness forward and focus on the small steps that can have a big impact. Such as reducing vehicular emissions by not buying cars that run on diesel, which is a far worse pollutant than petrol.Other measures such as clean energy or better public transport infrastructure may require policy intervention but public awareness of the need for the same can only help./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Two most polluted areas of MP are in 'City of Lakes',"Bhopal: Govindpura industrial area and Hamidia Road of Bhopal are the two most polluted spots of Madhya Pradesh. The MP Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) in its latest report concluded that these two localities of the state capital are even more polluted than Gwalior, which was recently 'crowned' the second-most polluted city in the world.Air pollution is measured by taking into account levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (Nox), Particulate Matter 10 and Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) in the air. But WHO focuses on PM10 and PM2.5 only - possibly because they are more harmful to health.As per a World Health Organisation (WHO) report of May, 329 was the value of PM10 in Gwalior (60 being the upper limit as per air quality standard). The value of PM2.5 is 176 against the national standard of 40. PM 2.5 is the most harmful since it goes inside the human body and can cause severe lung diseases.The MPPCB analyses the values of SO2, Nox, PM10 and PM2.5 to calculate air pollution. /It rates air quality in the following categories: Severe, Very Poor, Poor, Moderate, Satisfactory and Good. It concluded that Govindpura industrial area and Hamidia Road of Bhopal are most polluted after its year-long air pollution monitoring under the National Air Monitoring Programme of MP for the year 2015.Increasing number of vehicles, construction work and other human activities are the main reasons behind the increased air pollution in Bhopal, known for its greenery and referred to as the 'City of Lakes'.While the air quality of Hamidia Road and Govindpura industrial area has been ranked as 'Poor' by the MPPCB, the air quality at Gwalior was termed as 'Moderate'.At the remaining locations of the state, air pollution has been found to be between 'Moderate' and 'Satisfactory'. At two places - the regional MPPCB office in Ujjain and BCI Labour Club in Nagda - the air quality has been termed as 'Good'.When asked how Bhopal could be more polluted than Gwalior, MPPCB chief chemist Shyamanuj Tiwari said that WHO took into account air pollution figures of the year 2010 in its report, while the state pollution control board reports the latest existing conditions. ""Pollution from vehicles is the main cause of deteriorating air quality at the two places with the highest pollution in Bhopal,"" he added.There are around 1,000 industrial units in Govindpura industrial area, spread across 735 acres of land. Similarly, there are five different markets in Hamidia Road, with more than 500 shops.The president of Govindpura Industries Association, Mukesh Sachdeva, said, ""There are 2,000 slums in the area. Waste lies in the open all over on the roadside. It seems no government agency is looking after Govindpura industrial area."" He, however, added: ""Industrial pollution is not much in this area.""Talking about Hamidia Road, the president of Bhopal Automobile Merchant Association said, ""The flyover proposed over Hamidia Road must be constructed. It will help in reducing vehicular pollution. The divider on road should have a central verge for plantation.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Delhi's pollution takes 6 yrs from your life, says study","Pune: Delhi might be paying the steepest price for its air pollution with life expectancy dropping by 6.4 years while Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra are likely to account for the highest number of premature deaths in India, a study by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has revealed.Conducted by IITM scientists in collaboration with the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Colorado, the study is likely to further ignite concern over the need to improve air quality in the capital and urgently map its sources of pollution and their contribution to making Delhi an unhealthy city.The study is based on data compiled in the 2011 census to arrive at the figures of ""premature mortality"" due to exposure to particulate matter across the country.The study found that life expectancy in Maharashtra dropped by 3.3 years due to exposure to pollution.

""Can the high court order the state to implement the odd-even system?"" added the court./The lawyers for the petitioners insisted that the HC had powers to direct the state. Mumbai has a road network of around 2,000 km and as of 2015 there are over 25 lakh vehicles registered in the city. The petitioner said over 87% roads in the city are occupied by private vehicles, leaving only 13% for public transport./Bandra resident Shadaab Patel said in his PIL that traffic congestion, along with the use of diesel cars in the city, was contributing to air pollution. Another factor was lack of proper management of disposal of solid waste that is generated daily, resulting in open burning and accidental fires at civic dumping grounds, the PIL said. He referred to the fire at the Deonar dumping ground earlier in the year that led to haze and smoke in Mumbai for several days and the air quality index hovered around 250 and 300./Pedder Road resident Esha Kumar, in her application, sought orders to tackle traffic congestion in the city, that she insisted was hampering access to emergency services.

In India, more than 1.2 million people were estimated to suffer strokes every year, making it the leading cause of death and disability in rural India.Globally, about 15 million people suffer strokes every year, of which nearly 6 million die and 5 million are left disabled -including loss of vision or speech, paralysis and confusion.The Lancet study is based on analysis of data from a swathe of other studies, reports and official statistics to create a mathematical model estimating stroke risk for 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. The analysis was conducted by a team of international researchers.""It is a landmark study pointing at pollution as an indicator for stroke for the first time. /It is important also because there are no ideal treatment options for stroke and therefore, prevention is the best solution,"" says Dr C S Aggarwal, senior consultant, department of neurology , Ganga Ram Hospital. Findings of the study show 90.5% of the stroke burden was attributable to ""modifiable factors"" such as smoking, eating too much sugar and not exercising enough, as well as the associated health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease.Doctors say changing lifestyle and habits in developing countries is a major concern for increasing burden of non-communicable diseases.The study also listed air pollution as a ""modifiable factor"", indicating efforts by the government and people can make a difference. In low and middle-income nations in Asia and Africa, almost a fifth of stroke burden was attributed to household air pollution, while a similar percentage was blamed on ambient air pollution in China and India./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Dust, vehicle smoke responsible for bad air","Pune: Pollution levels in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar may be among the worst, but Maharashtra is also among the states where the air quality is horrendous and responsible for people's deaths. Closer home in Pune, experts said dust, vehicular emissions and industrial emissions are mostly responsible for the poor air quality. Pune also features among Maharashtra's worst-polluted cities in a recent World Health Organization (WHO) report. The report on the air quality of urban areas compares various cities in the world. /It said Pune has 92 micrograms per cubic metre of PM10, which is almost 1.5 times higher than the national ambient air quality standard of 60 micrograms per cubic metre. Although Pune's air quality fares better, the dust on the roads and that produced by construction cannot be ignored. ""The dust particles or particulate matter 10 is high in the city and above the prescribed level,"" Pune Municipal Corporation's environment officer Mangesh Dighe said. According to Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) data, the air pollution has increased by 35.7% since 2010. ""Pune is in the top five cities when we talk of lung diseases in the country. Although awareness has increased on air pollution and its ill-effects, a lot more needs to be done,"" chest physician Nitin Abhyankar said.Shivajinagar, Hadapsar, Katraj, Lohegaon and Bhosari are polluted. Analysts say this may be due to heavy concentration of vehicles and industries in these areas. A study by the IITM in collaboration with National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Colorado, said that Maharashtra records 10% of the country's deaths due to pollution. The state's most polluted cities, as per the WHO report, include Akola, Nagpur, Chandrapur, Jalgaon, Kolhapur Nashik, Amravati, Navi Mumbai, Mumbai and Pune. While PM10 is formed mostly of dust, PM2.5 particulate matter comes mostly from vehicular emissions. Experts have noticed that although the air quality of Pune is better than Delhi and Mumbai, it is mostly 'moderate', it did have 'poor' air quality on certain days. ""Pune city sees a lot of variation in the air quality. Colder temperatures lead to a rise in the air pollution as particulate matter hangs or remains suspended in the air. Hence, in the winter months, air pollution levels are recorded higher than the other months. Also, in the other months, during festivals like Diwali and New Year, the levels rise again and go into the moderate or poor category,"" a researcher with the System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) project said. In May and June, pollution levels are relatively lower than the other months. In Pune, the average concentration of PM2.5 in May this year was recorded as 38.02 and in Mumbai as 48.49 micrograms per cubic metre.A senior scientist explained that permissible level of PM2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3). Levels above that limit is a cause for concern, even if it lies in 'moderate' or 'poor' quality levels. High PM2.5 concentrations cause respiratory diseases like asthma and bronchitis. These particles can also penetrate deep into the lungs and blood stream. Experts and doctors have expressed concern about the rising fine particulate matter. Sundeep Salvi, director of the Pune-based Chest Research Foundation, reiterates that regular exposure to such pollutants causes ischemic heart diseases. The IITM report said there were around 2.5 lakh premature mortalities in 2011 due to exposure to PM2.5 and O3./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Indoor pollution levels in city alarming, finds study","Gurgaon: A study conducted by a private hospital and an NGO has painted an alarming picture of the quality of air we breathe indoors in Gurgaon. According to it, of the 100 offices and houses surveyed, 76% were found to have unhealthy indoor air quality with PM2.5 concentration over 250 microns per cubic metre (\xB5m\xB3). The study also found 31% of the population - who spend time indoors at offices and homes - had one or the other air-borne diseases, while 47% have symptoms of respiratory diseases.According to doctors involved in the study, manufacturing offices in Udyog Vihar were the most polluted, with PM2.5 levels of over 300\xB5m\xB3. IT offices were comparatively less polluted, with PM2.5 level of about 200\xB5m\xB3.Houses in the old city are more unhealthy, with PM2.5 level between 250\xB5m\xB3 and 300\xB5m\xB3. Even houses in Sushant Lok and DLF townships have PM2.5 level over 200\xB5m\xB3. At PM2.5 level of 100\xB5m\xB3, houses with the cleanest air were found in Sector 50 and 51. As per WHO standards, PM2.5 level should not exceed 60\xB5m\xB3. Concentration of PM 2.5 below 60\xB5m\xB3 is considered good, 60-100\xB5m\xB3 satisfactory, 101-250\xB5m\xB3 polluted, 251-300\xB5m\xB3 unhealthy, and above 300\xB5m\xB3 hazardous.""With people spending most of their time indoors, indoor pollution is becoming a major cause of respiratory diseases in Gurgaon residents. /We found 32% people in places with 'unhealthy' indoor air had symptoms of respiratory diseases. The figure was 59% for people in 'hazardous' places,"" said Dr Himanshu Garg, senior pulmonologist, Artemis Hospital, one of the survey partners.He added studies by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), International Agency for Research on Cancer and WHO show indoor air quality is more dangerous than outdoor air pollution. ""Since we spend more time indoors, the risk is more. Women and children are most vulnerable,"" said Dr Garg.Doctors held bad ventilation, lack of maintenance of ACs, construction work and use of chemicals, incense sticks, etc. responsible for the menace. ""In Gurgaon, the situation is worse because of construction work. Houses and offices close to construction sites have high indoor pollution,"" said Dr Pratibha, another pulmonologist.As remedy, experts said people should monitor air quality and keep indoor plants. ""People should regularly monitor air quality at home, ensure there are 2-3 airways in each room, and check air flow of ACs. Indoor plants, such as ferns, palms, peace lilies, golden pothos, snake plant and bamboo bring down indoor air pollution,"" said Surekha Singh, a city-based architect.Vijay Kannan of survey partner NGO Clean Air India Movement, said, ""The idea was to engage, educate and encourage people to adopt air friendly measures in the interest of their own health, and take measures to bring down indoor air pollution.""The study was conducted in 90 houses and 10 offices with over 150 employees each. Spirometry and symptom scoring was used for individuals, along with pollution level checks at each location./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Plastic shredding unit closed down,"Kochi: Thrikkakara municipality has shut down its sole plastic shredding unit after residents raised concerns of air pollution in the locality. According to residents, toxic smoke spreads over the area when plastic is processed in the plant. /This creates physical uneasiness, including suffocation and cough.The unit was installed at a cost of Rs 6 lakh. Due to shut down, plastic collection in the locality has been stopped partially.The plant began its operation in 2012. In the unit, large quantity of plastic will be burned and condensed into a single piece. This recycled product will be later shredded and used as raw material in construction of roads.During initial days, the quantity of plastic processed here was comparatively less. Later, two to three tonnes of plastic were recycled here.""The unit used to function everyday from 10pm to 4am,"" said C A Nishad, health standing committee member of Thrikkakkara municipality.""It was functioning in an unscientific manner. The smoke that erupts from the plant was highly poisonous as they did not install pollution control mechanism. The municipality could not install smoke stack scrubbers to reduce pollution,'' said M S Anilkumar, president of Thrikkakara residents' association apex council (TRAAC).He said smoke that erupts from the plant was capable of creating respiratory problems, including suffocation.""Pollution has already created a real mess in our livelihood,"" he said.However, after the unit had stopped functioning, the local body authorities said that they have entrusted a team to collect plastic wastes without undergoing any treatment.""The unit will remain closed until a consensus is made with the residents,"" said Anilkumar./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Odd-even is headed Bengaluru's way,"Dust and pollution are the bane of Bengalurean commuters and pedestrians. Now, in an attempt to crack down on the fog of smog enveloping the city, a weeklong drive to test emission levels was launched on Thursday. On the first day, more than 70 per cent of cargo vehicles failed the pollution test and were heavily penalised. /As a precursor to the government's final decision on banning pollution-emitting vehicles and implement Delhi's 'odd-even' formula, the state government appointed a coordination committee comprising various agencies: Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, Central Pollution Control Board, Transport department, BBMP, BMTC and the police department. The drive has been launched at entry points into the city. A five-hour-long initiative along the busy Mysuru Road revealed that several vehicles were flouting the Bharat stage IV emission norms. The agencies will hold similar drives on Tumakuru Road, Airport Road and other major roads that connect the city with neighbouring districts, this week. According to KSPCB, all vehicle-owners have been informed about the checks and in the days to come, surprise checks will be made to catch polluting vehicles. Giving details of the first day of the drive, Lakshman, chairman, KSPCB, told Bangalore Mirror that most violations were reported by cargo vehicles that enter the city from neighbouring districts like Ramanagara, Mandya and Mysuru. ""A total of 92 vehicles were checked for emission norms. Of the 71 petrol vehicles, only four failed the test. Of the 21 diesel vehicles checked, 15 failed the emission test. All of them were cargo vehicles like luggage auto-rickshaws, tempos and mini-trucks and belonged to other districts. We have not spared even those holding valid emission certificates and measured emissions using our certified equipment,"" he said. Transport authorities have penalised owners of polluting vehicles with a Rs 2,000 fine for first offence. Interestingly, BMTC buses, which are believed to emit huge amounts of toxic gases, had a 90 per cent pass rate. ""Almost all BMTC buses cleared the test with their emissions well under control,"" Lakshman explained. Starting from Monday, ""we have decided to include government cars that are used by bureaucrats and VIPs and they will also be checked for pollution from Monday,"" Lakshman said. Sources in the Transport department said that the government had no details about the nature of vehicles that cause the maximum pollution and have assigned the joint coordination committee to conduct a study and submit a detailed report. ""The study will help us find out the extent of the emission from various categories of vehicles. Currently, it is cargo vehicles that are emitting more smoke and we will wait a few days for the results to come in from other parts of the city too. After consolidating the report, we will submit a report to the government and recommend action,"" Lakshman said. The last scientific study on the city's air quality was done back in 2009. ""There have been various sources that add to air pollution, ranging from dust to vehicular emission. In fact, vehicular emission contributes 40 to 45 per cent of the city's air pollution followed by Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) that largely comes from road-side dust. Today, with the drive, we will be able to clearly figure out what categories of vehicles are causing the most damage to Bengaluru's air,"" Lakshman said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Nearly 1.59 million premature deaths per year in India linked to air pollution: IEA,"New Delhi: An estimated 6.5 million premature deaths in the world are linked to air pollution every year with more than half of them being reported from China and India together. India alone contributes 1.59 million deaths to this dubious figure. The global number will increase significantly, touching 7.5 million in 2040, unless the energy sector that emits majority of air pollutants takes greater action to curb emission, says the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its special report, released on Monday.The report, highlighting links between energy, air pollution and health, says no country is immune as a staggering 80% of cities that monitor pollution levels fail to meet the air quality standards set by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Though it notes that the number of deaths due to household air pollution (use of biomass for cooking and kerosene for lighting) at present is more than the deaths due to outdoor air pollution, the trend will reverse in 2040 as more and more people would be able to access the relatively cleaner cooking gas and electricity by then.In a chapter on India - a home to 11 of the world's 20 most polluted cities, the report highlights the recent measures taken by the country to curb its emission, particularly in power sector. /But, it notes, these achievements are more often offset by strong growth in emissions from industry and transportation sector, emphasising that the air quality will remain an important policy concerns even in 2040.The IEA, an autonomous organisation, works to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy to its 29 member countries. It was set up in 1974 to help these rich nations coordinate a collective response to major disruptions in the supply of oil.Noting that the air pollution is the fourth largest human health risk after high blood pressure, poor diets and smoking, the IEA's World Energy Outlook (WEO) special report says the energy production and use - mostly from unregulated, poorly regulated or inefficient fuel combustion - are the most important man-made sources of key air pollutant emission - 85% of particulate matter and almost all of the sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides.""Clean air is a basic human right that most of the world's population lacks"", said IEA executive director Fatih Birol, noting that the proven energy policies and technologies can deliver major cuts in air pollution around the world and bring health benefits, provide broader access to energy and improve sustainability.Referring to India's Capital, the report says that the the two coal-fired power plants (Badarpur and Rajghat) are the main sources of PM2.5 emissions in Delhi. ""Without action to tackle these emissions, among others, PM emissions in Delhi are expected to increase by 25% over the next 15 years under current legislation. Emissions could fall by 35% over the next 15 years, if effective measures to reduce emissions from the power sector and traditional open cooking were taken and proved successful,"" it says.Pollution deaths in India:Present (2015 figures): Total premature deaths due to air pollution - 1.59 millionDue to household air pollution - 1 millionDue to outdoor air pollution - 590000Projection (2040):Total premature deaths due to air pollution - 1.7 millionDue to household air pollution - 800000Due to outdoor air pollution - 900000/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Timely action could bring PM emissions down 35%,"NEW DELHI: The International Energy Agency (IEA) has said that Delhi's particle pollution could fall by 35% over the next 15 years if it manages to reduce emissions from the power sector, vehicles and biomass burning, including cooking with solid fuels in slums./IEA's World Energy Outlook 2016 report, which was released on Monday, has referred to an ongoing study commissioned by the ministry of environment to the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)./If these actions are not taken, Delhi's PM emissions will increase by 25% by 2030. ""Traditional use of biomass for cooking and two coal-fired plants (Badarpur and Rajghat) are the two main sources of PM 2.5 emissions in Delhi,"" the report states. Rajghat is likely to be shut down soon./The Delhi government plans to convert it to a waste-to-energy plant. Scientists at NEERI who are working on the city's pollution problem said modelling studies were being done at IIASA to observe how various scenarios would impact Delhi's air quality between 2020 and 2030. The study will be published in about four months and could provide a road map for air pollution action in the capital, the scientists said./""PM levels will come down if the government introduces BS VI norm by 2020. The power plants should convert to gas in the next couple of years and biomass burning for cooking or otherwise should stop to achieve a 35% improvement in PM levels by 2030,"" a NEERI scientist said. ""Solid fuels are still being used for cooking in the slums. People should convert to LPG. The final road map will be available once our report is ready.""/This is the first time that Paris-based IEA, an autonomous organisation which works to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its 29 member countries and beyond, has released a World Energy Outlook report on air pollution. It has flagged that around 6.5 million deaths globally are attributed to poor air quality making it the world's fourth largest threat to health after high blood pressure, dietary risks and smoking./The report has some interesting observations on how India and China are tackling air pollution. It states that while emission levels have started to decline in China, there is ""modest growth"" in India. ""In China, a strong policy focus on air quality bears fruit and the recent dip in pollutant emissions becomes a long-term trend: emissions of particulate matter are 40% lower by 2040 as energy consumption growth slows, the energy mix diversifies away from coal and strict pollution controls are enforced.../""In India, the pollution outlook worsens to 2040 as energy demand rises by 150% although tighter standards in the power and transport sectors, the replacement of traditional cooking fuels with LPG and ambitious targets for wind and solar, all help to limit the growth in pollutant emissions to around 10%,"" the report says./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

'Breathing toxic air is akin to passive smoking',"AHMEDABAD: Polluted air can be as dangerous as passive smoking warned medical experts at a public seminar held on Sunday at Ahmedabad Management Association (AMA). Air heavy with particulate matter - PM10 and PM2.5 - can increase chances of heartstroke. Polluted water, contaminating fruits and vegetables, is already causing a number of gastric problems. These were some of the observations made by the experts on hazards of polluted environment.HCG Hospitals had organized the seminar on 'Effect of Pollution on Human Health' at AMA where speakers included Dr Bhupesh Shah, Dr Hansal Bhachech, Dr Kaustubh Patel, Dr Parthiv Mehta, Dr Sunil Mehta and Dr Urman Dhruv. /The organizers said that their primary concern was the ever-increasing toxicity in air, soil and water that has already increased inflow of patients in the city. The speakers said that the only safeguard is better lifestyle and habits, and understanding that it was everyone's responsibility to save the environment.Speaking about pollution and cancer, Dr Kaustubh Patel, city-based oncologist, said that around 20% lung cancer patients the world over are non-smokers, and experts believe that rising pollution levels have a role to play. ""International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has already identified air pollutants including benzene, asbestos, radon and formaldehyde as carcinogenic, whereas it puts diesel engine exhaust, tricholrothlene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in the list of probables,"" said Patel.Dr Urman Dhruv, a consulting physician and diabetologist, said that exposure to air pollution puts in danger all who are already susceptible to stroke and have irregular heart rhythms. ""There is evidence for short-term associations between PM10 and hospital admissions for ischemic strokes,"" he said.The speakers elaborated that while Ahmedabad has not yet become as bad as Delhi, where smog is a common phenomenon, the time to change is now if we wanted to ensure better future for the next generations. Dr Bhupesh Shah, in his talk on pollution's adverse impact on the human heart, said that the city air already features high in PM10 and PM2.5 pollution.""Exposure to pollution causes issues including vascular spasm, chest inflammation and hypertensive nephropathy to a person,"" said Shah./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"By 2030, climate shift may kill 250k more per year","NEW DELHI: Climate change is likely to kill 250,000 more people each year by 2030, latest assessment by the World Health Organisation (WHO) shows. Most of these deaths will be caused from malaria, diarrhoeal disease, heat stress and malnutrition.India, which already has a high burden of these diseases, is expected to contribute significantly to the global death toll. A separate study conducted by the University of Oxford, published in the international medical journal Lancet earlier this year, projected 130,000 deaths in the country fromin 2050.The heaviest burden of diseases due to climate change will fall on children, women, elderly and the poor, further widening health inequalities between and within populations, WHO said. /It asked countries, including India, to spend more to protect itself from health risks linked to climate, such as extreme weather events and outbreaks of infectious diseases.The UN agency had set up an agenda and proposed key actions for its implementation during its recent Paris meet. WHO estimates that climate change is already causing tens of thousands of deaths every year.These deaths arise from more frequent epidemics like cholera, as well as the vast geographical distribution of diseases like dengue and from extreme weather events, like heat waves and floods.At the same time, nearly seven million people die each year from diseases caused by air pollution, such as lung cancer and stroke. More than half of these air pollution related deaths are being reported from China and India, with the latter's contribution to this dismal statistic being 1.59 million.Climatic conditions intensely affect diseases transmitted through water and insects. According to WHO's assessment, in the next 15 years, heat exposure will cause around 38,000 deaths. Deaths due to diarrhoea are projected to reach 48,000, as many as 60,000 due to malaria and 95,000 owing to childhood malnutrition.Highlighting the benefits of switching to cleaner energy sources, WHO said it will reduce air pollutants, besides providing desperately needed power for health facilities. ""The health sector should themselves make a greater effort to promote low-carbon healthcare facilities and technologies; these can simultaneously improve service delivery and reduce costs as well as climate and environmental impacts,"" it said.WHO has called for adoption of a new approach to link health economics assessment and climate change. For instance, by calculating the healthcare costs avoided when countries invest in mitigation of climate emissions. It has also announced a new working group which will articulate a coherent approach to health economics and climate change./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
