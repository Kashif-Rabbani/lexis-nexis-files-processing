"Metro work on, jams a norm on Charbagh road","Lucknow: Traffic congestion prevailing all day on the 100-metre stretch around Lucknow Metro construction work site near Charbagh railway station has disturbed Dr Faisal Ali's schedule. A resident of Lalbagh, Ali has to cross the area four times a day to reach his clinic in Alambagh for the morning and evening shifts./""I spend two to three hours caught in a jam every day as it takes 30-45 minutes to cross the area each time. It has disturbed my entire work schedule,"" said Ali, narrating his daily ordeal. Like Ali, traffic congestion outside the railway station entrance has become a challenge for thousands plying on the road. The worst hit are emergency cases or those who have to board a train or catch a flight./Charbagh witnesses heavy traffic because of railway and bus stations. Metro construction work has reduced the width of the road. The problem has been aggravated after the intercity roadways bus routes were changed. Buses from Vidhan Sabha Marg have to take U-turn from the intersection near Ravindralaya. Many buses stop at the U-turn to pick up passengers. Autos compound the problem by parking around buses./""A bus takes a turn in 10-15 minutes, resulting in a jam. By the time the jam is cleared, another bus comes and turns. As a result, congestion has become order of the day,"" said Sashi Prakash, a resident of Charbagh. Besides traffic jam, noise and air pollution too has registered an increase in the area, he added./People complained bitterly about lack of personnel to manage traffic, which, they say, along with diversion can solve the problem to some extent. Lucknow Metro had announced it will deploy traffic marshals to man roads but there are none to be seen, said Rakhi Singh, a commuter./""Police should deploy more personnel to manage traffic. Constables are rarely seen,"" she added./The trisection was chock-a-block with two and four wheelers. Rajiv Gupta was stuck in traffic jam for 45 minutes while his family which had arrived by Lucknow Mail kept waiting for him to receive him. ""Lucknow metro should appoint traffic marshals here as they did during construction at Alambagh,"" said visibly agitated Rajiv Gupta, who works in a private firm./Scene 2: 2pm/Several trains have arrived at the northern and northeastern railway stations. The number of vehicles increases. While some have to reach home from station, others are rushing to catch a train. The situation turns from bad to worse. ""I will miss my train, if I don't reach the station in five minutes,"" said a panic-struck Rajesh, who decides to leave behind his vehicle and walk all the way to the station along with the luggage. ""More traffic constables should be deployed here to manage things,"" said Samir, a bank employee, struggling through the traffic./Scene 3: 6pm/Arvind Makhija missed his train to Delhi because of the huge traffic jam at the trisection with the increase in inflow of vehicles after office hours. ""I came to board the Dibrugarh-Rajdhani Express but missed the train. I had to attend a meeting in Delhi but now I will have to think of some other way,"" said Makhija, a government officer./Scene 4: 10pm/Even in the night, there is no relief from traffic jam. Raji, who works in Air Asia, was caught in the congestion for over 40 minutes and missed the flight. ""Now I will have to forego my off day otherwise my salary will be deducted. It will also spoil my record,"" he said. Asthma patient Ashima Shourey said vehicular smoke during jam aggravates her condition./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Polluted Patna: City chokes on filthy air,"Patna: In the wake of a survey conducted by the World Health Organization in May last year, in which Patna ranked second after Delhi in the list of the most polluted cities, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has finally agreed to implement a rule prohibiting diesel vehicles that have been operational for 15 years or more from plying the roads of the city. Kumar also said the government was planning to restrict burning of plastic and solid waste. Despite these initiatives, air pollution in the city is increasing at an alarming rate. /Even though Patna does not have any heavy industry, its level of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) is very high. According to the Indira Gandhi Planetarium, the SPM level in the city in April this year was as high as 355 micro-grams per cubic metre, far more than the permissible limit of 100 micro-grams per cubic metre. Arvind Mallik, an expert in science, said, ""Vehicles emit oxides of nitrogen and sulphur, besides un-burnt particles of carbon that we see as the cloud of black smoke coming from the exhaust of cars."" These gases and particulates have serious effects on the human body and cause a range of problems like irritation in the eyes to acute cases of asthma.Students and office-goers, who travel across the city, bear the brunt of air pollution. Harsh Vardhan, a student living in Kankarbagh, said, ""I became a victim of sinus (paranasal sinus) when I was 14. The doctors said the root cause of this disease is pollution."" RK Das, a resident of Pataliputra, said, ""I take my vehicle once every month for pollution check. Punitive measures should be taken against those don't.""The process of pollution check involves inserting a nozzle into the vehicle's exhaust and checking the composition of the emitted gas. The whole process costs a paltry sum of Rs 50 in service centres across the city.A graduate from Patna Women's College, Priyanka Priyadarshini, said, ""I am compelled to use scarves or a mask and sunglasses while travelling in the city as the air mixed with dust and harmful gases causes irritation, headache and nausea if these precautions are not taken."" Ajay Patel, president of an auto union, said, ""The auto drivers usually don't take their vehicle for pollution check and the maintenance is done only when the vehicle stops functioning. Even the government is blind to issue of pollution control.""Sexagenarian Indu Devi, who is an asthma patient, said, ""When I lived in the village (Chakia in Motihari district), the ailment was under control. Ever since I moved to Patna for better treatment, the condition is getting worse. I have a problem breathing whenever I go to a place where vehicular traffic is high."" Shailaja Singh, who works in the Reserve Bank of India in Mumbai, said, ""The city (Patna) should also opt for CNG like Delhi. It is eco-friendly, cheap, and convenient to use.""

Made in Chennai stoves warm up lives in Himalayas,"Chennai: At the crack of dawn, 14-year-old Dsudee begins an arduous journey to collect firewood. Shivering under her monkey cap and sweater, the Class 9 resident of Khalsa village in Uttarakhand struggles through rocky terrain and uneven paths. She repeats this trip thrice a day, walking nearly 18km in total. /Once home, she helps her grandmother make a tall stack of rotis for the family, coughing and battling tears due to the clouds of smoke from the chulha or mud stove. But her difficult lifestyle is slowly changing for the better after 'clean stoves' were distributed to houses in her village as part of the Himalayan Clean Cooking Project (HCCP).Launched by the Chennai Hub of the Global Shapers Community and the Himalayan Environment Trust in 2014, the project seeks to supply clean cooking stoves to remote mountain communities. These stoves combust the same fuels - wood and biomass - more efficiently. ""We got the idea when we were stuck in a hailstorm during a trek in Himachal Pradesh. We took shelter in a hut but the smoke was suffocating,"" says Varun Gunaseelan, project director.In an article on the World Health Organisation (WHO) site dated March 2014, an estimated 700 million people in India still rely on solid fuels and traditional cook stoves for domestic cooking. It further states that having an open fire in the kitchen equivalent to burning 400 cigarettes an hour. Women and young children are considered the first victims of smoke-related acute and chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. ""According to WHO estimates, in 2012 there were close to 1.7 million premature deaths attributed to household air pollution from cooking in the Southeast Asia region with India shouldering the biggest burden,"" it says.After extensive research and surveys, the HCCP team distributed their first batch of single-burner stoves to all the 55 households in Sidri village in Uttarakhand, last year. ""We conducted road shows and live demonstrations by boiling water. On seeing that the water heated much faster, many locals placed orders,"" says Varun, adding that the stoves were provided at a discounted price of 1,000.The village headman, Ram Singh Pawar, said that households continued to use the appliance as it produced 'less smoke, cooked food faster and used lesser wood.'For the next phase of the project, the team partnered with Puducherry-based social enterprise, Prakti, to provide double-burner stoves suited for Himalayan families. The stoves accommodate wood, cow dung and agricultural wastes without processing while the steel combustion chambers ensure the fuels combust more completely. ""The stoves produce 80% to 95% less smoke compared to traditional mud stoves and three-stone fires. It also uses 40% to 80% less fuel and reduces deforestation,"" says Prakti program officer Mimi Liu, adding that cooking time is brought down by about 70%.Limited access to healthcare facilities in these remote areas makes fuel-efficient stoves the need of the hour. ""Using these stoves is crucial as early exposure to large amounts of smoke and pollutants could lead to asthma, wheezing or bronchitis in children below five years and prolonged exposure can cause lung cancer,"" says Dr Samantha Balaji, who is pursuing her masters in paediatrics.The team now conducts periodic roadshows and awareness programmes through student volunteers for various mountain communities on clean cooking methods./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Allergy conference stresses on diagnosis,"KOLKATA: Allergic diseases and asthma constitute a growing health problem with a marked socio-economic impact worldwide rightfully considered as an 'Epidemic of the 21st century'. With the changing environment and lifestyles, climate change, air pollution there is an increasing prevalence of more complex forms of allergic diseases and asthma worldwide.In order to reduce the burden of this global public health problem, there is a crucial need to establish an integrated approach to the diagnosis and management of allergic diseases, asthma and comorbidities, to develop research, health statistics, and better practice parameters and to link this to policy changes.Disseminating state-of-the-art knowledge on allergic diseases, asthma and related chronic diseases, the impact of the environment, lifestyle and early life determinants as well as increasing public awareness, enhancing scientific exchange and research is key to developing better and more effective treatment and preventive strategies.With its rich scientific program and renowned faculty, and the theme ""Expanding the Horizons of Allergic Diseases and Asthma: From Epigenetics to Treatment and Prevention"" IAACON 2016 (Indian Academy of Allergy Conference 2016), organized by the Indian Academy of Allergy presented a valuable and unique opportunity for attendees, both specialists and generalists, to update their knowledge, advance their skills as well as interact with colleagues, leaders and world experts in the field.The program included practical and hands-on workshops, plenaries, symposia, oral abstracts and poster presentations by young as well as the established experts and an industry-focused exhibit area. /Finally, as the cultural capital of India, the host city Kolkata has many things to offer - historic attractions, fabulous eating places and bustling markets in the backdrop of the Hooghly river making it an unforgettable cultural experience./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Unfit vehicles continue to poison air,"KOLHAPUR: Unfit and out-dated vehicles are adding much to the city's pollution, but not much crackdown by the Regional Transport Office (RTO) is visible.RTO officials claim that few owners approach to renew the authorisation of such vehicles even after the stipulated period of their use expires. The number of unfit and unauthorised vehicles, mostly auto-rickshaws and vehicles used for passenger transport, is increasing owing to the failure of the public transport. The RTO says it does not have adequate manpower to act against the unfit vehicles and those plying without renewing registrations. /The RTO has no data for the action taken on the unfit vehicles in the city. In July, it found 421 cases of vehicles emitting harmful gases. The civic body has allowed these vehicles to ply by merely imposing fines between Rs 100 and Rs 1,000. The RTO has collected fines of around Rs 58,800 in July.Assistant regional transport officer Ramchandra Kharade said, ""At present, there are three active squads for the entire district to check vehicular emissions. Also, we don't have the facility to scrutinize the pollution under control certificate (PUC) provided by several centres. We are trying to make the vehicle operators aware about pollution. Besides, we have simplified the processes to get the registration renewed and the tests done. This will help the vehicle owners apply in large number for renewal.""As per the rules, the private vehicles should not ply once they complete 15 years. Some vehicles get additional period on the basis of the fitness level. At the time of renewing the registrations, the operator has to undertake several tests, produce all documents and upgrade the machines in the vehicles to ensure low air pollution. According to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration should not exceed 150 microgram per cubic metre. On the other hand, the respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) should not exceed 80 microgram per cubic metre. The data accessed from various air monitoring centres in the city such as Dabholkar Corner and Mahadwar Road shows that the SPM has been reached up to 390 micro gram/cubic meter and RSPM to 120 micro gram/cubic meter. The environmentalists claim that increasing number of unfit vehicles are more dangerous that those newly added as the later ones at least have advanced system to emit less harmful smoke. The trend of the operators to mix kerosene in petrol to make more profit out of less fuel price has made air more polluted. Uday Gaikwad, a city-based environmental expert, said, ""Vehicles that are unfit or have passed the certain number of years should be discarded. We don't remember a single drive by RTO against polluting vehicles in the near past. The RTO should make the drive schedule public each time it decides to take action.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Swargadwar chimney defunct, pollution rises","Bhubaneswar: The electric chimney installed at Swargadwar in Puri has become defunct, increasing pollution at the sought-after crematorium. The Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB), which had installed the chimney two years ago, found it defunct recently and asked the Puri municipality to make it operational. But, the municipality is sitting over it.Located along the sea beach, Swargadwar witnesses cremation of at least 40 bodies every day. /Around seven bodies can be cremated below the platform where the chimney has been installed.Taking note of the air pollution beyond the permissible limit, the pollution board built the chimney and handed it over to the civic body. ""We have been receiving complaints that is not being maintained properly. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had taken serious view of the pollution caused by the crematorium and asked us to install the chimney,"" said OSPCB regional officer (Bhubaneswar-Puri) Hadibandhu Panigrahi. The chimney has the capacity to absorb 12,000 microgram of dust and smog every hour. ""Without the chimney, we have recorded emission of particulate matter of 727 microgram per metre cube from the cremation ground as against the permissible limit of 100. If remain unchecked, the ambient air will become highly polluted. This can lead to pulmonary diseases,"" said an officer of the pollution panel.The OSPCB said that the municipality is yet to take steps to install 20 such chimneys and prevent cremation of bodies in open space. ""After the NGT asked the Puri municipality to comply pollution control norms, the latter gave it in writing, promising to set up 20 more chimneys,"" said Panigrahi.In February, Puri collector Aravind Agrawal slapped a showcause notice on the civic body for an alleged violation pertaining to use of the land meant for the expansion of Swargadwar. The municipality has constructed stalls on the 100 decimal land that was given to the municipality for expansion of Swargadwar for creation of 20 more platforms for cremation. Swargadwar was set up in 1985 with the government allotting 900 decimal. In 1988, another hundred decimal was acquired for expansion of the crematorium./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution speeds up death of lung cancer patients,"NEW DELHI: A big, population based study of lung cancer patients in California has shown that their survival is linked to the amount of air pollutants they are exposed to. Those living in areas with high levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (both PM10 and PM2.5) live less after acquiring lung cancer. And, this is all the more true for those in early stages of the deadly disease.The researchers tracked the health outcomes up until the end of 2011 of more than 352,000 people newly diagnosed with lung cancer between 1988 and 2009, and whose details had been entered into the US California Cancer Registry. /Using data from US Environmental Protection Agency air quality monitoring stations, study participants' exposure to air pollutants was mapped to their residences. The study is published in the journal Thorax.Lung cancer is of several types and depending on when it is diagnosed, survival rates are different. For patients with early stage disease, average survival time was shortest for those with small and large cell cancers (around 1.5 years) and longest for those with adenocarcinoma (around 5 years).Almost half of the study participants (45.4%) lived more than 1500 metres away from a major interstate motorway. Less than 10% lived within a 300 metre radius of one.After taking account of these, and other potentially influential factors, the calculations showed that higher exposures to each of the four pollutants were associated with a correspondingly heightened risk of death and shorter average and 5-year survivals.But the magnitude of heightened risk was greatest for patients with early stage disease, among whom average survival was 2.4 years for those with high PM2.5 exposure (at least 16 ug/m3) and 5.7 years for those with low exposure (less than 10 ug/m3), for example.Overall, for patients with early stage disease, risk of death from any cause was 30% greater for NO2; 26% greater for PM10; and 38% greater for PM2.5. The impact of exposure to O3 was small (4%).These trends were particularly evident among patients with early stage adenocarcinoma.As might be expected, survival for patients with advanced disease was poor, irrespective of exposure to pollutants.This is an observational study so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. And the researchers point to several caveats, including a lack of data on potentially important risk factors, such as an individual's lifestyle, smoking status, and alcohol intake; and the inability to capture road traffic pollution.The most recent figures from the World Health Organization estimate that 1.8 million new cases of cancer were diagnosed in 2012 alone./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
MPCB finds fault in waste dumping,"Aurangabad: The municipal corporation may land in trouble for the alleged unscientific disposal of solid waste at the Naregaon dumping yard.Dhananjay Patil, regional officer of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), submitted his affidavit-in-reply to the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday stating that the municipal commissioner has not obtained necessary authorisation from the board and also not provided any facility for Municipal Solid Waste Management (and handling) Rules, 2000.He submitted the affidavit-in-reply following a PIL filed by N L Jadhav and other lawyers.Jadhav, appearing party-in-person, had approached the court seeking directions to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to shift its garbage dumping yard from Naregaon. He said the yard has been causing health problems to those living in a radius of 10km. Besides, the thick smoke emanating from the dumping yard has also become a major problem for flight operation from Aurangabad airport, he said.The petition came up for hearing before justices R M Borde and K L Wadane.

HORN JUST NOT OK PLEASE,"Low traffic awareness and lack of basic civic sense seem to force the hand of otherwise sane motorists when it comes to honking. They say that there are too many motorists who cut lanes without warning, or ride in the middle of the road slowly or stop abruptly./Something similar happened to fashion designer and adventure biker Anukaran Singh. ""Honking is a necessity. When friends on multiple two-wheelers ride parallel to each other without consideration of those behind them, there is no choice but to honk to make way,"" he said./Vikram Naidu, an entrepreneur, said badly designed roads were just as much at fault. ""Take, for instance, WHC Road. So many lanes open up on it, so someone on the main road has to be on the lookout for another motorist emerging abruptly from one of these lanes,"" he said, contrasting this situation with that of Chandigarh where the main roads and lanes are separated by service roads./Anaadi Shivnani, project director of a start-up called Dream Catchers, said that excessive honking is more of a psychological issue that has its roots in the stressed lives we lead. ""Honking while driving has pretty much become a habit for many people,"" he observed./Taking a dig at those who argue that honking is a necessity, ENT specialist Dr Madan Kapre said, ""Well, so is food and water. But anything done in excess is bad.""/Many panellists advocated bringing awareness among youngsters about the evils of too much honking. Zeenat Syed, principal of Podar International School at Besa, says it should start at the school level. ""We had a project called 'Green and Go' to teach children about the importance of following traffic lights. Something similar on honking would be a good idea,"" she said./Anjali Gaidhane, head of the department of political science at Hislop College, said that it might be all right to honk while driving on the highway and overtaking someone. Some panellists, including Dr Kapre, countered this, saying that nowadays, most highways are four-lane and there is no need to honk on them./Activist Shyamala Sanyal said that it is most irritating when people honk at red lights. She said police action is what is needed to curb this annoying habit. Dr Anil Laddhad, president of NGO Janakrosh that deals with traffic awareness, said that citizens should go honking-free for two hours each day. ""People will then realize the peace that comes with it and start doing so on their own,"" he said./Business analyst Rashmi Singh said that refraining from honking is something she already practises and has realized that it is not necessary. ""We will stop honking at the drop of a hat the day we stop looking at others as obstacles,"" she added./Gaidhane observed that unlike water or air pollution, which become apparent due to dirty water bodies and plumes of smoke, noise pollution is invisible and, therefore, does not get the attention it deserves. She added that in the West, each driver, before he or she gets a driver's licence, gets a lot of training, which sensitizes them about traffic etiquette./On the other hand, Dr Kapre added, in India, the attitude is that if one breaks the rules, one is smart. ""You see these parents and grandparents jumping the red light even when they have children travelling with them. Naturally, the kid will think, 'Wow, grandpa is so smart breaking the rules' and do the same,"" he said. This, he said, creeps in when it comes to honking as well./Gaidhane said that loud horns may get the driver attention and give him or her a false sense of power. Syed recalled a personal example, saying that when she was on a holiday to Kerala, she did not hear any loud honking despite the narrow streets there. ""It was just a great sign of maturity of the drivers there,"" she said./Loud honking is not just an irritant, it is also a proven health hazard. Dr Kapre explained: ""The sound can startle you and this could make you lose control over your vehicle, which can then lead to accidents.

Prolonged exposure to such sound can make one agitated. ""Many people complain that they arrive at their workplace frazzled and stressed due to traffic noise,"" Dr Kapre said. Very loud horns can also cause what is known as sudden acoustic trauma, he added./He added how a local study revealed that students studying in a quieter neighbourhood tended to have better concentration than those with a lot of noise./Again, the panellists agreed that lax administration was to blame for not taking efforts to make people aware of sound levels. Naidu claimed that he kept seeing fewer and fewer no-honking signboards across the city. He added that the situation across the country had become so bad that even luxury car makers were fitting horns with a much louder sound for models to be sold in India, just because of the high traffic noise./Anaadi Shivnani added that in a place like Delhi, there were just 15 noise meters for 86 lakh vehicles. Even in Bhubaneswar, which is India's first Smart City, there were just over 200 traffic policemen for the 10-lakh vehicular population, he added./Police inspector Shyam Sontakke, who joined the discussion late due to official engagements, said that honking was, indeed, low on the priority list of traffic police, who focus on much graver offences such as riding without helmets, jumping the red signal and dangerous driving.

""But I can't understand why the public is just not becoming aware of the issue,"" he said./Towards the end of the discussion, the panellists also spoke about the role of activists in the scenario. Gaidhane said that some activists were indeed making a difference.

HORN JUST NOT OK PLEASE,"Low traffic awareness and lack of basic civic sense seem to force the hand of otherwise sane motorists when it comes to honking. They say that there are too many motorists who cut lanes without warning, or ride in the middle of the road slowly or stop abruptly./Something similar happened to fashion designer and adventure biker Anukaran Singh. ""Honking is a necessity. When friends on multiple two-wheelers ride parallel to each other without consideration of those behind them, there is no choice but to honk to make way,"" he said./Vikram Naidu, an entrepreneur, said badly designed roads were just as much at fault. ""Take, for instance, WHC Road. So many lanes open up on it, so someone on the main road has to be on the lookout for another motorist emerging abruptly from one of these lanes,"" he said, contrasting this situation with that of Chandigarh where the main roads and lanes are separated by service roads./Anaadi Shivnani, project director of a start-up called Dream Catchers, said that excessive honking is more of a psychological issue that has its roots in the stressed lives we lead. ""Honking while driving has pretty much become a habit for many people,"" he observed./Taking a dig at those who argue that honking is a necessity, ENT specialist Dr Madan Kapre said, ""Well, so is food and water. But anything done in excess is bad.""/Many panellists advocated bringing awareness among youngsters about the evils of too much honking. Zeenat Syed, principal of Podar International School at Besa, says it should start at the school level. ""We had a project called 'Green and Go' to teach children about the importance of following traffic lights. Something similar on honking would be a good idea,"" she said./Anjali Gaidhane, head of the department of political science at Hislop College, said that it might be all right to honk while driving on the highway and overtaking someone. Some panellists, including Dr Kapre, countered this, saying that nowadays, most highways are four-lane and there is no need to honk on them./Activist Shyamala Sanyal said that it is most irritating when people honk at red lights. She said police action is what is needed to curb this annoying habit. Dr Anil Laddhad, president of NGO Janakrosh that deals with traffic awareness, said that citizens should go honking-free for two hours each day. ""People will then realize the peace that comes with it and start doing so on their own,"" he said./Business analyst Rashmi Singh said that refraining from honking is something she already practises and has realized that it is not necessary. ""We will stop honking at the drop of a hat the day we stop looking at others as obstacles,"" she added./Gaidhane observed that unlike water or air pollution, which become apparent due to dirty water bodies and plumes of smoke, noise pollution is invisible and, therefore, does not get the attention it deserves. She added that in the West, each driver, before he or she gets a driver's licence, gets a lot of training, which sensitizes them about traffic etiquette./On the other hand, Dr Kapre added, in India, the attitude is that if one breaks the rules, one is smart. ""You see these parents and grandparents jumping the red light even when they have children travelling with them. Naturally, the kid will think, 'Wow, grandpa is so smart breaking the rules' and do the same,"" he said. This, he said, creeps in when it comes to honking as well./Gaidhane said that loud horns may get the driver attention and give him or her a false sense of power. Syed recalled a personal example, saying that when she was on a holiday to Kerala, she did not hear any loud honking despite the narrow streets there. ""It was just a great sign of maturity of the drivers there,"" she said./Loud honking is not just an irritant, it is also a proven health hazard. Dr Kapre explained: ""The sound can startle you and this could make you lose control over your vehicle, which can then lead to accidents. A woman and her daughter died precisely like this near Narendra Nagar when they fell down from their two-wheeler after a heavy vehicle behind them honked loudly, throwing the ill-fated duo on to the road.""/There are many other ways in which loud and persistent honking sound in traffic affects all of us.

SC dictat: ADA all set to reduce pollution near Taj,"AGRA: Following the Supreme Court's direction to reduce pollution near Taj Mahal, the Agra authorities have finalized a plan to promote electric crematorium, besides installing a 'green' system to reduce discharge of carbon particles while burning of body through traditional method at Moksha Dham, located adjacent to Taj Mahal.A sum of Rs 9.5 crore will be spent in the entire exercise by the Agra Development Authority (ADA). Talking to TOI, ADA secretary Rajesh Kumar Srivastav said, ""At Tajganj electric crematorium two additional furnaces will be installed at a cost of Rs 3.5 crore. Beautification and landscaping of the area will also be done.At Moksha Dham, which is located at just few hundred meters, the wet scrubber technique would be employed to reduce carbon pollution. It is one of the most effective techniques to reduce pollution level. /Under the wet scrubber system, smoke from pyres will be passed through a water channel which in turn will reduce emission of carbon particles, supposedly one of the main causes for turning the 17th century white marble monument yellow. A sum of Rs 5.8 crore would be spent, he added.The official informed that the department plan to complete both the works by the end of this year. The services at the electric crematorium would be provided free of cost to people.In April, 2016, the Supreme Court had directed to the Agra Development Authority to submit its final report on the action plan to reduce air pollution due to burning of bodies at Moksh Dham (crematorium) near the Taj Mahal. SC judge Kurian Joseph, during a personal visit to Agra, had noticed the burning pyres at the ghat.

At least 25 pyres are burnt here each day, and the ashes rising from these have been damaging the Taj, studies have found.Later in December, the court deferred the shifting of the cremation ground and asked the authorities to look into ways of reducing carbon emission from burning of pyres as well as beautifying the place./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Pradhan hopes to spread cheer with Centre's LPG scheme,"Bhubaneswar: The Narendra Modi government's thrust on subsidised LPG to women in rural households has helped the oil ministry shed its image of a profit-making wing into a social welfare one, Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said here on Thursday.""LPG has been so far seen as a commercial product in India and never considered as a catalyst for social change earlier,"" Pradhan said adding that his government hopes to change this, bringing clean fuel to millions of households in the country. The minister was speaking at the inaugural session of a two-day international conference on 'LPG: a catalyst for social change', which commenced here on Thursday. Experts from over 10 countries discussed the best practices on accelerating access to LPG and evolved strategies to create a thriving market for the clean fuel.Quoting a WHO report, Pradhan said 15 lakh people die every year in the world due to indoor air pollution, with five lakh of them in India alone. /""Indoor air pollution is responsible for significant number of acute respiratory diseases in young children. Traditional sources of cooking are causing indoor household pollution leading to serious health implications particularly on women and children.

1.4m lives lost in India due to air pollution in '13: Study,"India lost 1.4 million lives to air pollution in 2013, while in China the toll was 1.6 million, estimates a World Bank report released on Thursday./The report, released by the World Bank and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, shows that in 2013 more than five million deaths worldwide were attributed to health conditions caused by air pollution. About 60% of them were in the world's two most populous countries./Exposure to air pollution increases a person's risk of contracting ailments such as lung cancer, stroke, heart disease and chronic bronchitis./China and India aren't among the worst hit in absolute terms because of the sheer size of their respective populations. Even after adjusting for population, these two countries along with Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan were among the 15 nations with the highest toll per million population./China and India ranked 4th and 6th worst in the world respectively . Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan were ranked 11th, 12th and 15th on this count./The bank estimates that in 2013 Georgia saw the highest rate of air pollution deaths per million of its population at 2,117. It was followed by Cambodia with a death rate of 1,300 per million./Among the 142 countries for which the bank complied this data, there were 10 where the rate was higher than 1,000 deaths per million. Australia fared best on this parameter with an estimated death rate of 34 per million./The report also estimated that air pollution cost the world economy more than $5 trillion -purchasing power parities (PPP) at 2011 prices -in welfare losses and an additional $66 billion worth of manpower loss./China's overall welfare and manpower loss was $1.6 trillion while India lost more than $560 billion, which was equivalent to over 10% of China's and 8.5% of India's GDP./Air pollution is estimated to be the fourth leading fatal health risk worldwide after metabolic risks, dietary risks and tobacco smoke. The estimates are based on exposure to PM2.5 pollutants. It is noticeable in the report that the risks are much higher in the developing world./By damaging people's health and causing fatal diseases, air pollution can have a lasting effect on a person's economic productivity./Experts argue that typically the economically weakest section is the worst hit because of limited access to health care facilities. Thus, exposure to bad air quality and other risks will ultimately widen the existing economic inequalities, they say./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Students come forward to help civic body keep celebration decibel low,"Kolhapur: The civic body has roped in students from three city colleges to keep a tab on air and noise pollution by processions as well as create awareness among the residents about eco-friendly and noise-free celebrations on the immersion day on Thursday. The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) will take the help of the students of the environment engineering department of the Kolhapur Institute of Technology (KIT) as well as those of the department of environmental sciences of Shivaji University, Kolhapur (SUK) to record air and noise pollution levels during the procession of the Ganesh mandals. The corporation will then use the information of the recordings to act against the mandals that have violated the sound limit. The air pollution data obtained will thus be utilised to undertake measures to control pollution during the festival period. /Ravindra Nikam, head of the environment engineering department, KIT, said, ""The KMC has identified the locations along the procession route where the readings for sound and noise pollution will be recorded through our team of six to seven students headed by a faculty member. The use of high decibel sound system affects the noise pollution figures while the heavy crowd along the routes leads to the air pollution due to dust. We are also going to study the chemical composition of the air during the procession period for further studies.""P D Raut, head of the department of environmental sciences, SUK, said, ""Massive sound systems and DJs have been found flouting the permissible noise levels in the past. Many parts of the city, including the residential areas, have experienced almost double the permissible decibel limits.""He further said that in the past, studies undertaken by the department research students have found the air pollution levels to become double as well. During the 10-day festival, the city experiences a sharp rise in air pollution causing suspended particulate matter (SPM) and respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM).The smoke associated with the SPM particles includes gases like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, both hazardous for one's health, he said.The KMC has published a list of 20 silent zones where as per the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 200, the noise levels are restricted up to the prescribed limit. The students from KIT and SUK will also study the noise level at the notified silent zones along the routes. Besides, new silent zones can be declared after the studying the results of the exercise.R K Patil, head of environmental cell of the KMC, said, ""Other agencies such as the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and the police department will have their own teams in place to record the noise pollution levels. The data generated with the help fo the KIT study will help us compare the readings to take action against the defaulting mandals.""Meanwhile, around 250 students from D Y Patil College of Engineering and Technology will participate in the awareness drive against the use of high pitch sound systems on immersion day. The students, according to the college officials, are associated with the National Service Scheme (NSS) and are studying degree and diploma courses in engineering.P D Chougule, the initiative coordinator from the college, said, ""We have been organizing this initiative for the past five years. this year too, we will be distributing pamphlets highlighting the harmful effects of high-pitch sound systems. The volunteers will also distribute the cotton balls to the public to decrease the severity of noise during the processions./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

India was placed just ahead of Pakistan and Bangladesh, which were ranked 149th and 151st respectively.India's poor performance on hygiene, air pollution mortality are among factors that place it lower than countries like Bhutan, Botswana, Syria and Sri Lanka. For malaria, which was one of the health indicators assessed, India scored only 10 points and remained in the red zone. /Similarly for hygiene, the study gave India just eight points while for PM2.5 (particulate matter), it scored just 18 points.For under-five mortality India scored 39 points while for Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) it scored 28 points.India, however, scored above 80 points for performing well in areas like Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD), which are a diverse group of communicable diseases, overweight and harmful alcohol consumption.In 2015, the health-related Iceland, Singapore, and Sweden fared the best on the SDG index, with the UK ranking fifth just ahead of Finland.The Central African Republic, Somalia, and South Sudan had the lowest values on the index.

"Aravali mess threatens Delhi, NCR groundwater","The groundwater that supports life in Delhi and NCR is in imminent danger of getting contaminated by toxic discharge from a colossal mass of rotting filth lying in the Aravali hills. This is not a problem a day, a week, or months in the making. The gigantic environmental mess has festered over three years on a pristine stretch of Aravalis in Gurgaon's backyard, resulting, today, in 11 lakh tonnes of untreated garbage lying untreated at the site of a dysfunctional waste-to-energy plant (a truckload of garbage is 9 tonnes, to put it in perspective). And it's growing every day. By the time you read this, it will be richer by a few thousand tonnes more. /This putrid mass has been producing leachate - a fetid, viscous liquid discharge noxious for the environment - that has, over the years, not only radiated sideward, down the slopes of the hills where the plant is located but also seeped through the rocky fissures of the Aravalis in the direction of the groundwater aquifer. The leachate, fed by rain, has formed a giant cesspool behind the plant, slow-poisoning everything around it. The air has turned perennially fetid for villagers living nearby, a natural water pond in Bandhwari has been contaminated and the forest department is worried that it will soon start affecting wildlife in the region. There is no conclusive report available on how far the leachate has travelled downward and whether it has reached the groundwater table. That's largely because the Haryana and central governments have been slumbering through this crisis. Their tepid response to this grave ecological problem has only exacerbated it. Environmentalists have, in the meantime, rushed to the National Green Tribunal for a solution. They fear leachate has already reached the groundwater aquifer. Water samples collected from behind the plant compound and tested by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board showed a high level of contamination.Because of its geographical location at a higher gradient, Bandhwari is a critical recharge point for the water table. If leachate seeps into the aquifer here, it will spread rapidly to south Delhi, Faridabad and Gurgaon because the groundwater flows outwards towards the three cities from here. That's why environmentalists are extremely worried. It took decades of awareness campaigns and policy decisions to get the battle against air pollution under way in Delhi and NCR. Now, as the other basic element of life faces a grave threat, the government cannot afford another belated awakening. The pile-up of garbage at Bandhwari started in Diwali 2013 when the plant, which was jointly operated by the Gurgaon and Faridabad civic administrations, stopped functioning after a sudden fire. But the dumping of garbage, primarily household waste, from both districts continued. Rekha Singh, an environmental scientists who tested water samples from Bandhwari and has submitted the report to the NGT, believes leachate has already reached groundwater. ""The contamination from the leachate pond has started, causing fluoride, phenolic compound, cadmium and mercury poisoning,"" she told TOI. ""It may have serious health effects on residents,"" she added. Since the leachate pond is an open water body, it also endangers the health of animals and birds who drink from it. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of research at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), agreed that the continuous formation and accumulation of leachate at Bandhwari is a major concern. ""Since the waste is not being treated, the leachate may contain several harmful pollutants like nitrates, sulphates and heavy metals,"" said Roy, adding it could trigger intestinal problems and skin diseases if it mixed with groundwater. Vivek Kamboj, who has filed the petition in the NGT, explained why contamination at Bandhwari would ultimately threaten all of Delhi and all of NCR. ""A 2008 Central Ground Water Board report shows that groundwater from Bandhwari flows outwards in all directions, which is why it's a major recharge zone for downstream areas. The aquifers of the whole region are inter-connected, so contamination of groundwater in Bandhwari will lead to contamination of groundwater of the entire region,"" he said. Even when the plant was functional, villagers complained of leachate leaking from the site. A report by the HSPCB in 2013 said the plant's operator violated several provisions of municipal solid waste rules. The state government too appeared to have violated provisions of the 1999 municipal solid waste rules while setting up the plant. It did not construct a non-permeable lining system at the base and walls of the waste disposal area, nor did it make provisions for leachate collection and treatment, stipulated in Schedule 4 of the rules./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Thick black acrid smoke enveloped the area around 1 am on Sunday. Residents from nearly half a dozen housing societies rushed out, fearing fire in their apartments.""The stench from the smoke was unbearable. /We soon realized that the smoke was emanating from fires on a vacant plot near Meerut Road.

We didn't have any idea who employed the labourers to burn the drums,"" said Vikrant Sharma, an environmental activist who lives in Raj Nagar Extension.The workers resisted when the residents dissuaded them from burning the tar. A call was made to the police control room by one of the residents following which a PCR van arrived on the spot and took the workers into custody.A complaint in this regard was registered at Sihani Gate police station by Madhusudan Bharadwaj, a resident of Gaur Cascade apartments. An FIR was filed under Section 278 (making atmosphere noxious to health) of IPC, a non-cognizable offence, on the basis of the complaint.The five workers, who were arrested under Section 151 (arrest to prevent cognizable offences) of CrPC, were sent to judicial custody by a local court on Monday.""Following the sudden intervention of residents at night, a conflict brewed between them and the workers.

90% of world's people breathe dirty air: WHO,"Nine out of 10 people in the world are breathing poor quality air, a new report by the World Health Organisation said calling on countries to take action against air pollution which is causing over six million deaths a year globally .With the use of new interactive maps, the UN agency found 92% of the world's population living in places where air quality levels exceed WHO limits.India accounts for 75% of the 8 lakh air-pollution related deaths annually in the South East Asia Region, whereas 90% of the world's casualties from poor air quality are in low-and middle-income countries, the maps show identifying specific areas where pollution levels are extremely high.""Fast action to tackle air pollution can't come soon enough,"" said Maria Neira, the head of the WHO's department of public health and environment. Asking countries to strengthen measures to control air pollution, Neira said, ""Solutions exist with sustainable transport in cities, solid waste management, access to clean household fuels and cook-stoves, as well as renewable energies and industrial emissions reductions.""The UN agency's report said 94% of the pollution-related deaths in lowand middle-income countries are due to non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular diseases, stroke, chronic obstructi ve pulmonary disease, lung cancer. Air pollution also increases the risks for acute respiratory infections.Over 6 lakh people die in In dia every year of ailments caused from air pollution such as acute lower respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, ischemic heart disease and lung cancer.The report represents the most detailed outdoor (or ambient) air pollution-related health data, by country , ever reported by WHO. /The model is based on data derived from satellite measurements, air transport models and ground station monitors for more than 3000 locations, both rural and urban. It was developed by WHO in collaboration with the University of Bath in UK.According to the report, the problem of air pollution is most acute in cities, but air in rural areas is worse than many think and poorer countries have much dirtier air than the developed world, it said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

'Data on exposure to air pollution inadequate',"AGRA: A recent study by experts from University of Massachusetts, IIT-Bombay and Desert Research Institute in the US points out that the amount of air pollution exposure data available in India is largely inadequate. And considering the growing urbanisation and other factors that are exposing more people to polluted air, efforts should be made to study the impact of pollutants on the general public to have better policy guidelines, the study said./Air pollution is a global environmental burden, and has been identified as a significant public health risk. Human exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution (AAP) and household air pollution (HAP) are important risk factors for morbidity and mortality, particularly in developing countries, the report said./The study done by Pallavi Pant (University of Massachusetts), Sarath K Guttikunda (Institute of Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai) and Richard E Peltier (Division of Atmospheric Sciences, Desert Research Institute, USA) and accepted by the Environmental Research journal for publication stated that particulate matter PM10 concentrations in India often exceed the national air quality standards. In 2010, 140 out of 176 cities were found to exceed the PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) standard values./The study said that in India, more than 50% of the population lives in areas where ambient PM2.5 levels exceed the annual PM2.5 (40 mg/m3) Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and only less than 0.01% of the population lives in areas that meet the WHO PM2.5 guideline of 10 mg/m3. This is in stark contrast to Europe, where only 10-14% of the population lives in areas that exceed the European PM2.5 guideline value (25 mg/m3)./In India, the Global Burden of Disease study (2010) identified both AAP and HAP as key risk factors in terms of disease for the Indian population. Nearly 100,000 premature deaths in India are linked to air pollution exposure. In Delhi alone, between 7,350 and 16,200 premature deaths have been attributed to PM exposure./Stating various health hazards of high PM levels, the report said a clear understanding of pollution exposure concentrations and trends and associated health effects will not only help improve the quality of life of Indian citizens, but also help improve the field of exposure science./“Data from developed countries is not readily translatable in the Indian context due to differences in source types, as well as lifestyle. Much of the research has focused on large cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata), and there is little ambient or indoor pollution data for smaller cities and towns. Characterisation of pollutant concentrations in urban areas is important since smaller cities and towns often lack public transportation options, and in many cases, fuel quality is poor. Due to haphazard urban growth, a large number of people live in close proximity to mobile, as well as point, pollution sources, increasing the risk of exposure to harmful pollutants,” Pant said./The report said most of the available data is focused on coarse PM (PM10 or PM5), and there is little information on the exposure to fine and ultra-fine PM. However, the most significant health effects are associated with fine particles, and there is a need for greater focus on characterisation of exposure to fine and ultra-fine particles, especially in urban micro-environments. Additionally, several unique sources (for example, waste burning, construction emissions) are poorly characterised or not characterised at all. Studies characterising public health impacts associated with air pollution are limited in number, as well as scope. There are no detailed analyses on various indoor sources (apart from solid fuel combustion) in India and how the concentrations might vary across households with different median income levels./One of the recommendations was that assessment of exposure to air pollution without taking into account variables such as gender and socio-economic status can lead to skewed understanding of such exposure. Thus, future research should be based on a holistic framework which considers scientific and social aspects linked to air pollution exposure./""In 2015, PM Narendra Modi launched the 'smart city' initiative. It is imperative that development plans for such cities, including consideration for breathable cities with clean air — for example, a comprehensive assessment of exposure levels in different transport modes — can also be helpful in making policy decisions, such as bicycle lane planning or the choice of fuel for public transport so as to minimise exposure to pollutants,"" Pant said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

No data-led changes in Swachh Bharat: CSE,"There has been a huge political and financial investment on the Swachh Bharat Mission by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The programme, however, is straining to achieve the desired results. There is a struggle to bring in the much required behavioural change among people to use toilets - the backbone of the programme's success. One of the key factors for this is the lack of credible on-ground data and the absence of institutionalised tracking mechanisms to measure the health benefits of impacts of proper sanitation, or the adverse impacts of the lack of sanitation. /While large-scale campaigns are essential to drive behavioural change, it is data that will connect the issue with health impacts and lead to impact on the ground. This emerged as one of the key takeaways from a National Consultation on Sustainable Rural Sanitation organised here today by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). Currently, India does not have any mechanism for tracking water-borne diseases to shed more light about the progress on the sanitation programme. Sunita Narain, director general, CSE, pointed out, ""Our experience and our work in air pollution bears out that change happens when we make a connection to people's health. And the issue needs to be handled differently for rural and urban areas. While in the urban milieu toilets have to be linked with disposal and treatment systems, in rural areas the priorities should be to address the issue in the context of poverty, behavioural change by linking it with health, water availability, toilet design and waste disposal."" The major issue with the current approach of the Swachh Bharat Mission is the undue focus on construction of toilets. October 2, 2016 marked the completion of two years since the ambitious Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was announced from the ramparts of the Red Fort. One of the key promises made was to make India open defecation free (ODF) by 2019, by constructing toilets for 1.04 crore households, apart from 250,000 community toilets and 260,000 public toilets. The reality on the ground however paints a dismal picture, with the government leagues behind in meeting its target. According to an analysis by the recently launched Hindi edition of Down To Earth magazine, which CSE helps publish, 82.3 million (or 823 lakh) toilets are yet to be constructed across India by October 2, 2019. This means the country needs to build 2.3 million (23 lakh) toilets every month - or a formidable 56 toilets every minute - to meet the target! However, more than looking at this as just another failed government scheme, there is a larger picture that emerged during the national consultation, which brought together sanitation champions, failed states, technical experts/consultants, government officials, non-profits and donors. What emerged from the discussions was that apart from the obvious problems of poverty, lack of access to water, unavailability of land or lack of delivery of government programmes, the most critical issue was in terms of data-driven behavioural change in people. Parameswaran Iyer, secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation said, ""It took 30-40 years for people in the US to accept seat belts. In India, we are trying to compress the time frame in the context of sanitation. The challenge here is how does one scale up while maintaining quality and sustain the momentum after triggering such behavioural change."" It is clear that there is no 'one size fits all' solution. Sikkim for instance is one of the successful states that achieved complete sanitation coverage. Haryana and Kerala excelled in their respective sanitation programmes, while states like Jharkhand, Bihar and Odisha failed miserably. Rajkumar Yadav, district collector, South Sikkim, said, ""We followed a strategy of putting two different types of pressure on people - one positive and the other negative. Positive pressure was put through campaigns and social messaging across sections of society. Negative pressure was applied by restricting and denying government benefits to those who haven't constructed toilets or haven't given up open defecation. This has helped create an overall positive impact."" It is clear that a range of solutions is required, accounting for the varied geographies, socio-political setting and other factors in our diverse country - from technological solutions, to behaviour change, to scientific data gathering to policy interventions. ""CSE has started the process of drawing out shit flow diagrams to understand the flow of faecal matter. We are also setting up India's first faecal sludge laboratory to test technologies for their effectiveness,"" said Narain. This will be a crucial first step towards such data gathering, especially in understanding sanitation in the rural context. ""Rural sanitation is more complex due to dimensions of poverty, and is much more extensive and inhuman, especially in the context of gender.

Civic workers take to burning waste in most areas in Belagavi,"BELAGAVI: The inherent contradiction in the Belagavi City Corporation's (BCC) emphasis on technology to monitor waste disposal, and the instructions issued by the garbage contractors to their workers to resort to a more primary form of disposal - burning - is hard to escape. Belagavi has to compulsorily adopt scientific disposal of garbage, since it has been selected for the Smart City project. Unfortunately, contractors appear to be telling their workers to just burn the waste, which is only compounding the problem of air pollution. /Trash collected from bins installed across the city, and in the market areas, too are being burnt, a practice that is particularly rampant in the extension areas. Moreover, plastic waste is being set ablaze as well. The disturbing practice of torching garbage comes against the backdrop of BCC's door-to-door waste collection campaign. While waste is collected regularly in some of the more affluent localities, residents in most other areas have pointed out that garbage collection is highly irregular, prompting them to dump it on the side of the road or open spaces. A resident of Shahapur, Manjunath Patil said, ""I have raised objections to the practice of burning waste, but to no avail. We can't go on arguing with everyone, including the civic workers.""Moreover, civic authorities have not been proactive in creating awareness, and curbing the harmful practice. Burning of waste is widely prevalent in market areas. A trader on old PB Road, Shivaji Kelkar said, ""We need to dispose the waste on an hourly basis, but it not being done. Those who are unaware of the consequences, are setting it on fire. The stench is unbearable when plastic and rubber waste is burnt.

50% rise in air pollution in 10 days,"GURGAON: There has been a 50% rise in air pollution in Gurgaon in the last 10 days as compared to last month. Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) attributes this increase to stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana and low wind speed after rain early this month. The situation, according to the board will become worse ahead of Diwali.While the average concentration of PM2.5 in the city was 39.34 micrograms per cubic metre in August and 54.46 micrograms per cubic metre in September, it increased to an average of 111.23 micrograms per cubic metre in the first 10 days of October, according to data from HSPCB.HSPCB data also indicates a decrease in wind speed -- while September's average wind speed was 1.63 meters per second, it came down to an average of 1.02 metres per second in the first 10 days of October.""Delhi and NCR cities report an increase in air pollution every year as soon as paddy burning season begins in Haryana and Punjab. /Also, the decrease in the wind speed after it rained on October 4 has led to increase in concentration of PM2.5,"" said an official of HSPCB.Talking about various initiatives taken by HSPCB to keep a check over paddy burning this year, Bhupinder Singh, regional officer of HSPCB, said, ""The board has taken several initiatives. We have been running awareness campaigns in villages and conducting regular meetings with gram panchayats to spread awareness on ill-effects of paddy burning. Paddy burning not only causes air pollution, but reduces the concentration of nutrients in soil and reduces its fertility. Besides, we are using banners and posters to spread awareness in the city."" Some experts expressed concern over air pollution caused by crackers and effigy burning on Dushehrra. ""The situation starts getting worse in October every year, with the change of season, paddy burning and arrival of Dushehrra and Diwali. I request people to say no to crackers this year and go for laser shows and street plays instead of burning effigies. It will help bring down air pollution during winters,"" said Prof Sushil Dayal, a city-based environmental scientist.Doctors, on the other hand, advise people prone to breathing problemls and skin diseases to stay indoors on Dushehrra. ""It might sound weird. But we are expecting the situation to go worse this year as we have already started getting some cases of breathlessness. People, especially children who have asthma, bronchitis or any other respiratory diseases are advised to stay indoors on Dushehrra, particularly in the evening,"" said Dr Kartik Deshwal, a pulmonologist.""Nearly 100,000 premature deaths in India are linked to air pollution exposure, says a Global Burden of Disease study. Apart from respiratory diseases, air pollutants can cause severe damage to skin. Air pollutants rob skin cells of oxygen, and cause free radical production in the skin. Intake of vitamin C should be increased in diet at this time,"" said Dr Nivedita Dadu, a dermatologist./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Khanna sees fall in air pollution levels,"KHANNA: Even as Khanna has achieved the dubious distinction of being among the world's 20 most polluted cities in the world, the recent data of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) suggests some fall in the air pollution levels in this industrial city, though they continue to be higher than normal. The data suggests that the annual average for Khanna (recorded at two observatories) was 116.5 ppm (parts per million) in 2012, and after that it witnessed a jump and was recorded at 178.5 in 2013. The data suggests that RSPM (Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter) level for the city fell to 162.3 in 2014, and further to 122.5ppm last year. Environment experts say Khanna has been notorious for high air pollution levels for quite a long time now. /""Khanna has been one of the hotspots of air pollution, and has been showing high levels for quite some time now. The normal value for air pollution levels is around 100ppm, but if the value is more than 120 ppm, then there is a problem. The Punjab Pollution Control Board or the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) can make a local assessment of pollution sources, and frame an action plan to control the problem,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Research and Advocacy wing of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).Local doctors say air pollution is badly affecting the health of city residents. ""Around four years ago, we would get just 5 -6 cases of respiratory ailments, including asthma and other allergic respiratory diseases at our hospital, but now the number is around 8 -10 a day. Shockingly, the patients also include children,"" said Dr Amarbir Singh, a reputed physician, who runs a private hospital in the city. PPCB authorities say the drop in pollution levels is a welcome change./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Biggest challenge to Swachh Bharat Mission's success is lack of data-led behavioural change',"PUNE: There has been a huge political and financial investment on the Swachh Bharat Mission by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The programme however, is straining to achieve the desired results states the New Delhi based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). There is a struggle to bring in the much required behavioural change among people to use toilets - the backbone of the programme's success. One of the key factors for this is the lack of credible on-ground data and the absence of institutionalised tracking mechanisms to measure the health benefits of impacts of proper sanitation, or the adverse impacts of the lack of sanitation, CSE stated in the press release./While large-scale campaigns are essential to drive behavioural change, it is data that will connect the issue with health impacts and lead to impact on the ground. Currently, India does not have any mechanism for tracking water-borne diseases to shed more light about the progress on the sanitation programme. Sunita Narain, director general, CSE, pointed out, ""Our experience and our work in air pollution bears out that change happens when we make a connection to people's health. And the issue needs to be handled differently for rural and urban areas. While in the urban milieu toilets have to be linked with disposal and treatment systems, in rural areas the priorities should be address the issue in the context of poverty, behavioural change by linking it with health, water availability, toilet design and waste disposal.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
WHAT ARE YOU SMOKING? - Air quality worst early in the morning,"PM10 Far Exceeds Safe Limits In Parts Of Gurgaon, DwarkaWinter's coming. And, already, the signs are ominous: Qutab Plaza in Gurgaon recorded an average PM10 (coarse, pollution particles) level of 421 micrograms per cubic metres between September 20 and October 7, which is more than four times the national 24-hour safe standard.Similarly, Dwarka sector 22 recorded an average PM10 level of 203 micrograms per cubic metres during the same period -twice the national safe standard. Sector 13 in RK Puram, at the other extreme, recorded an average PM10 level of only 20 micrograms per cubic metres -lower than the WHO guidelines.All this has been revealed by the information collected by the Indian Open Data Association as a part of an air pollution data experiment.The data indicate a large variation in air pollution levels in different parts of the city. While the Central Pollution Control Board and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee together monitor 11 locations this project has now brought together trends from different parts of NCR where air quality isn't monitored by any government agency .IODA, a data startup, deployed low-cost air-quality monitors at several locations last year and has just started analysing the trends. /Last year, IODA had called for volun teers to install these monitors outside their homes or offices Finally , 30 monitors were installed that have made continuous readings of PM10 and PM2.5(fine, respirable air pollutants).Mrutyunjay Mishra, co-founder of IODA, said: ""PM10 levels are breaching the safe standard most of the times, particularly from night up to mid-morning. We also noticed that particulate pollution peaked from safe levels to poor within a fortnight from September 20 to October 7, indicating a strong association with the weather.""PM10 levels at locations under IODA are ""poor"" mostly between 8 pm and 10 am and the worst during early mornings. While the PM10 averages are high at many locations, the range is very large -for instance, Qutab Plaza recorded a maximum PM10 level of 788 micrograms per cubic metres during the fortnight compared to a minimum of only 56 micrograms per cubic metres.The DPCC and CPCB data may also give us a slightly skewed picture. Areas such as Anand Vihar are always seen to be far more polluted than south Delhi locations. More localised monitoring may actually overturn these findings. For instance, IODA data show parts of Dwarka and Gurgaon to have very poor air quality.""The DPCC and CPCB devices are super-sensitive and their readings are always higher than what the low-cost ones measure. Having a network of low-cost sensors is important for creating public awareness because they show the same trends as the government's monitoring stations.The data is more granular and we can scale up deployment of low-cost sensors to cover more areas,"" said Mishra.There is usually a 5-10% variance in air pollution levels monitored by the government's stations and lowcost sensors. The data also helps make a direct correlation with sources of pollution. Qutab Plaza, for example, has too many construction projects around it. ""It's obvious such high levels are because of construction dust,"" said Mishra.The idea of tracking air quality through low cost monitors was first floated by Mishra at the MIT's Kumbathon last year in Nashik. ""The idea was to make data truly open because data is knowledge and helps solve problems. I realised people wanted to contribute,"" said Mishra, who along with his team, procured 51 low-cost air-quality monitoring kits. So far, the team has invested nearly Rs 20 lakh into the project.Asutosh Dikshit, CEO of United Residents Joint Action, for instance, tied up with IODA to mount these monitors at its locations.""We decided to install them because seeing these levels will push people to change their behaviour. Air pollution levels will eventually impact property prices too and that is a very sensitive issue for residents,"" said Dikshit./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Rising air pollution taking a toll on tourism in Haridwar,"HARIDWAR: The rising air pollution in the city which is attributed to several factors like vehicular smoke, emissions from industries and the most rampant -- open burning of garbage and dry leaves in many parts of the city -- is steadily taking a toll on the tourism business in the holy city. Hotels, restaurants and other tourism industry stakeholders admit that during the past few years, pilgrims and tourists visiting the city have been affected by the rising air pollution. “I estimate that in the last 5-6 years, there has been a 30-35 per cent fall in tourist numbers in Haridwar. Many tourists now spend only a limited time in Haridwar and then turn towards Rishikesh or other places where the air is a little better and the areas more clean,” says Sumit Srikunj, a travel agent./Those who have lived in Haridwar for many years say the situation is worrisome because the city is regarded as one of the holiest in the country and had been known for its serene and peaceful atmosphere. “Earlier, it was possible to sit for hours near the Har-ki-Pauri and enjoy the serenity of the Ganga ghats, but now it is simply not possible to do so. There are heaps of open garbage lying at several places and with winters approaching, these heaps are often lit causing unwarranted pollution,” says Shiv Sharma who has lived in the city since the last three decades./Open burning of garbage is not an uncommon sight in Haridwar. In the absence of a proper system of garbage disposal, many people and institutions find it the easiest way to dispose of trash. A resident near the Har-ki-Pauri who did not wish to be named said that clothes left at the ghats by pilgrims in great quantity are often burnt in the open. Dharamshalas, hotels and ashram also resort to this practice at times, she alleged./Purushottam Sharma Gandhivadi, president of the Ganga Sabha, which is responsible for the upkeep of the Har-ki-Pauri denied that clothes left at the ghats as ""per tradition"" are burnt in the open. He said that they are “collected in drums by our employees and then handed over to the nagar nigam sweepers."" However, he acknowledged that “the Ganga Sabha can play a more active role in creating awareness about air pollution.”/With the general consensus being that the occupancy in hotels has seen a dip in numbers primarily due to the pollution problem, it’s time that other stakeholders also come forward to take the initiative to put an end to the most visible forms of air pollution like the open burning of waste -- which can be easily curbed -- and also put pressure on district officials to ensure that this practice is put to an end in the city./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Mumbaikars' lung function 35% lower than in westerners',"Mumbai: The World Health Organisation’s recent statement that 90% of people across the globe breathe polluted air should cause greater alarm in Mumbai than in most other places. The lung function of Mumbaikars is at least 30% to 35% lower than that of healthy Europeans and Americans, a new study has found. The test involved 1,000-plus healthy people who came to a south Mumbai hospital for a checkup./The study, presented at the European Respiratory Society meeting in London recently, not only shows that Mumbaikars have a reduced lung capacity but stresses that the gap between Indians and Caucasians has been worsening over the past 20 years. “As part of the lung function test, we ask people to breathe out air forcefully. What the study has showed us is if a person could breathe out three litres of air a decade ago, he is breathing out almost 20% less now,” pulmonologist Dr Sujeet Rajan said. According to him, the worsening lung capacity is related to environmental pollution and changing dietary habits./The study looked at lung function using a spirometry test for 1,041 healthy people, 34% of them women. “Using statistical methods, we found that the lung function of Mumbaikars was 25-30% lower than Europeans and 32-38% less than healthy Americans,” Dr Rajan, who consults at Bombay Hospital near New Marine Lines, said./A study done by chest specialist Dr S R Kamat more than 20 years ago and published in Lung India had showed that Indian test values were 20-24% lower compared with some other ethnic groups./Incidentally, Indian lungs are known to be smaller in comparison to other ethnicities. “A 15-20% correction in lung function parameters is always allowed when Indians are compared with Europeans. But how can we account for a difference of 30% or more?” Dr Rajan said, adding, “With increasing slowing of vehicular traffic across the city, especially in the suburbs, air pollution is definitely high.”/Air pollution levels in most Indian cities, including Mumbai, are among the highest in the world; with winter inversion barely a month away, pollution levels are likely to soar. But it’s not just the dipping lung function that worries doctors. Chest specialist Dr Sanjeev Mehta said Indian lungs were known to be smaller than their western counterparts. “We know that Indians suffer heart attacks more often than Westerners because we have smaller arteries. We know we have smaller lungs, but if our lung function is going to reduce because of air pollution. We are staring at a greater health calamity than we thought,” said Dr Mehta./In fact, the recently released Global Burden of Diseases Study has shown that a third of deaths in India are caused by heart attacks, lung obstructions and strokes. Similarly, a study done in a Mumbai hospital last year showed that 40% of the 87 people tested had lower-than-ideal lung function, or weak lungs./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Experts caution public to stay away from firecracker smoke,"Inhaling cracker fumes can lead to different lung ailments and one need to take extra precaution during Diwali, warned city-based health experts. According to them, inhaling fumes may worsen the condition for pre-existing asthma and bronchitis patients. Children and elderly with lung diseases are most vulnerable to such smoke that contains sulphur dioxide, which causes throat irritation and breathlessness.Dr Prakash Vichare, a veteran paediatrician in the city, said, ""Number of children with respiratory issues have increased in the last few years. /People are so habituated to the use of firecrackers during the festival that it is hard to say preserve our environment now. Allergic Bronchitis and asthma is what we have observed as one of the major outcome of this pollution. Kids suffer the most due to air pollution and it can even prove fatal, if not cured on time.""Vichare also said that infants should be given proper sleep or rest. Diwali celebration can disrupt their routine and ultimately the health. ""Air pollution reaches higher than normal levels during Diwali. Hence, citizens need to be extra cautious as well as responsible while bursting firecrackers,"" he said.Elaborating further, Vichare said, ""Firecrackers contain chemicals like sulphur dioxide that is mainly responsible for respiratory problems such as cough, breathlessness and irritation in the throat. It also worsens pre-existing conditions such as asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia.""He warned people - with underlying lung and heart diseases - to stay away from smoke of fireworks, and take their medication regularly, eat fresh fruits and drink plenty of water.A city-based eye specialist, said, ""Though injuries by firecrackers are common during Diwali one can avoid such incidents by knowing basic safety measures.

Contributing to the pollution were weather conditions, heavy preDiwali traffic and smoke from crop fires. /""Diwali traffic has been a factor and it won't improve soon,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director of Centre for Science and Environment.""The onset of winter pollution has begun and as conditions begin to get colder, pollution levels will rise slowly,"" Chowdhury said. the onset of winter pollution has begun and as conditions begin to get colder, pollution levels will rise slowly,"" Chowdhury said.""The weather and cold will mean the particulate matter stay closer to the ground. Leading up to Diwali, the air is expected to stay very poor,"" she added.Chowdhury said, other contributing factors such as crop burning would also affect air pollution levels. ""Already the air is starting to get choked and preventive measures now need to be looked at as the quality will deteriorate further after Diwali,"" she added.At the US embassy , the air quality index read 177 on Sunday , which is classified as 'unhealthy', despite it be ing recorded in the relatively clear Chanakyapuri area.Experts said weather conditions, coupled with wind conditions also contributed to a high reading. The wind speed in Chanakyapuri was 0.8ms, meaning the particulate matter could not disperse in the area.""The temperature is starting to dip and the air quality has been fluctuating between poor and very poor in our data. Low wind speeds will mean a high reading as pollutants don't disperse easily and the low temperature will keep the pollution levels like this in the coming week as well,"" said a SAFAR scientist./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

City vendors see drop in sale of firecrackers,"THANE: Everyone is counting days for Diwali, which is one of the most awaited festival of the year. Every year, bursting of firecrackers used to begin a week or two before Diwali. But this year, this has been less. /This can be seen by the sale of firecrackers in the city which has dropped as compared to the previous years.One of the reasons behind this may be because of the increase in awareness among adults and children about the ill-effects of firecrackers on the environment.Ashwini Pathak (38), a Vrindavan resident, said, ""We never wanted to celebrate Diwali with firecrackers, but our 12-year-old used to force us to buy a few as he would burst them with his friends. However, he recently started helping out at an animal NGO. There he realised how the noise affects animals. So, this year, he refused to buy any crackers and even convinced his friends to reduce their fireworks shopping. In fact, he convinced them to light only sparklers (fuljhadis) this time.""Another resident, Shubhik Sharma also shared the same views. ""Last year, we were bursting crackers in our building and one of the rockets went into my neighbour's house and broke a flower pot. The smell of smoke hovered around for a while which resulted in many of us getting a headache. Since then, we decided not to use crackers. Instead, we are lighting our compound and building with LED diyas,"" said 17-year-old Shubhik, a Devdayanagar resident.With many environmentally-conscious denizens now shying away from these noise and air polluting hazards, the stock of fireworks in city stores is gathering dust. ""The sales of crackers till now has been low. We don't know the exact reason behind it yet. It can either be is because many residents are refraining from using them or the fireworks' stalls are yet to be set up at the grounds in Kopri, Shivaji maidan and so on due to a delay in securing permissions. Whatever the reason, we hope the sales pick up soon,"" said Sanjay Ahuja, a vendor from Kopri.Meanwhile, many housing societies are creating awareness by putting up notices and sending out messages on social media sites. Rajesh Kumar, a Brahmand resident, said, ""We cannot force anyone to do things. However, we have created a WhatsApp group for our society members where we discuss the effects of using crackers on the environment.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Respiratory ailment rising in Haridwar due to air pollution,"DEHRADUN: The situation of air pollution is going from bad to worse in Haridwar as per the residents and medical experts both, especially in past one decade the holy city has registered escalated respiratory patients. The residents who once enjoyed the serene ganges and cool breeze sometimes land up cursing themselves for making home in the city. ""We bought home here considering green environment, clear water and fresh air but now there is no trace of clear air. My both the kids are struck by asthma so is the condition of my father who is 78. Me and my wife literally regret the decision, city has turned into a total chaos."" /said Mahesh Tiwari, a resident of Haridwar who is actually a native of Kanpur. The doctors also agreed to the fact that places such as Balmiki Chaouraha, railway station road, Chandaracharya chowk and Arya Nagar Chauraha are the hotspots of air pollution and majority of their respiratory patients hale from these places and Haridwar is no more a safe place to roam without mask on face, ""In the current state Haridwar is a horrible city for children from 3 to 10-year as they are short height in this age and the vehicular pollution which is escalating immensely in Haridwar due to illegally moving vikram and tempos in the city hit them most. Past decade has seen rampant cases of chronic choryza, bronchitis, asthma attacks and asthmatic bronchitis in children."" said Dr. Vijay Verma, senior consultant physician, Haridwar. Recalling the tranquil environment of yesteryear, one of the elderly persons from the city, Aviral Mishra said that earlier they have tangas and rikshas which maintained the beauty and purity of holy city by all means but now these environment-friendly mode of transport have vanished. ""We want the olden culture of tanga and buggies to restart in our city, it will help to maintain the ecological balance of Haridwar in multiple ways. Not that early, but barely 15 years ago the city had ample of ecological safer mode of transport which really helped the environment of city to remain pure but now it's a hell out here."" he added. Meanwhile, pressing on the need to send expert doctors from health department to Mecca in Saudi Arabia for learning ways to manage health system, Dr. Vijay, said, ""Every year Makkah welcomes crores of people but we never see rising pollution or communicable diseases in the city owing to its 'pilgrimage' status like that of Haridwar. But our city's health graph in last ten years has simply fallen among all the 13 districts of Uttarakhand. Department or government should send its civic and health experts to world's pilgrim sight to actually learn the ways of managing the sea of tourists to be able to manage events such as ardh-kumbh, kumbh and various monthly fests when Haridwar is flocked by several lakh people."" Meanwhile the chief medical officer of Haridwar, Dr. VS Janpangi also admitted that the holy city has recorded significant rise in respiratory patients, ""The daily outpatient duty record of various government hospitals of Haridwar clearly mentions that in last ten years a significant rise is recorded in the patients struck by cough, asthma and lungs related diseases indicating rising prevalence of pollutant in the environment of Haridwar thereby, respiratory patients."" It is noteworthy that Haridwar witness most of the foreigners putting mask while roaming in the city however, locals are seen roaming carefree but they are the ones who are falling prey to ever-increasing pollution in Haridwar whose root cause is tourist and of course ill-managed civic infrastructure as per medical experts. Not just this but old residents of Haridwar have come out openly to blame """"religious mafias"""" for another devil dwelling in city namely -- noise pollution -- impacting hearing and speech ability of locals. And ENT specialists have already warned the elderly patients at the risk of facing more terrible times in coming years if ban is implemented in the city effectively./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Don't let smoke, sound, burns spoil festive fun","Lucknow: People suffering from asthma, bronchitis and other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) should take extra care of themselves during Diwali as experts say their medical condition can aggravate around the festival./Last year around Diwali, the tiniest form of suspended air pollutant - PM 2.5- had seen an increase of 152% from the previous year, according to the ambient air quality report of Lucknow by Indian Institute of Toxicology Research Centre (IITR). Being small in size, PM 2.5 travels easily through the respiratory tract, sticking to the lungs, causing short term effects such as eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, coughing, sneezing, runny nose and shortness of breath, apart from worsening asthmatic and heart conditions./Long term exposure causes increased rate of chronic bronchitis and reduced lung function. Heart patients should also take prevention./""Season change with smoke in the air creates additional problems when the pollen and pollutants in air combine. Patients should not overdose or under-dose their medication and take expert help if breathing issues worsen,"" said Dr Ved Prakash of respiratory department of King George's Medical University (KGMU). Not just respiratory issues, ear, nose and throat (ENT) are also under threat from the high decibels of sound and air pollution. ""Every year, there is an influx of 2-2.5% patients of acoustic trauma post-Diwali. Sound levels should be maintained around 80-85 decibels and with cracker noise at around 130 decibels, buzzing, irritation, dizziness, long term hearing impairment and other ear problems start. If not treated early, some might even become irreversible,"" cautioned ENT surgeon Dr Rakesh Srivastava./Air pollution due to Diwali crackers also causes nasal problems like breathing difficulties and collection of fluid behind the ear that may lead to hearing loss. With respiratory issues, the heart is also at a higher risk and irritability, blood pressure and blood sugar rise./""Night coughing is a phenomenon that increases during Diwali. Smoke adds to it and it is advisable to take an anti-allergic seven days prior and post-Diwali. If problem persists, nebulisers and inhalers should be used on prescription,"" added Dr Srivastava./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pollution jumps up even before Diwali fireworks,"Gurgaon: Smoke from uncontrolled bursting of crackers during Diwali is yet to envelop the city, but current air pollution levels have already risen steeply compared with September. The spike is the result of a combination of rampant stubble burning in farms in Punjab and Haryana as well as low wind speed.Pollution control board officials claimed air pollution in Gurgaon at this time of the year is lower than elsewhere in NCR, thanks to ongoing awareness drives against stubble burning and cracker bursting. But doctors in the city begged to differ, citing a steep rise in the number of patients with respiratory diseases. /Dr Himanshu Garg, Artemis Hospital said, ""In the past 2-3 months, we witnessed 20-30 cases of choking, chest infection, asthma and COPD. They have risen by 25% to 30%, which is shocking, considering winter hasn't even begun. Such symptoms are more common later, when smoke particles turn into smog."" Dr Manoj Goel of Fortis Hospital added, ""We've seen a sudden rise in patients with chest infection, asthma, COPD, irritated throat and cough. Compared to the last 2-3 months, there's an increase of about 15-20% in October.""Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) data shows the average concentration of particulate matter PM2.5, which was 32.4 micrograms per cubic metre (\xB5g/m\xB3) in August, rose to an average of 54.4 \xB5g/m\xB3 in September. In October, it further increased to an average of 83.8 \xB5g/m\xB3.""There has been a steep rise in concentration of PM2.5 this month, compared with September. Besides stubble burning, pre-Diwali bursting of firecrackers and low wind speed are also behind the rise in pollution,"" said an HSPCB official.

"Health weekly round up: Secondhand smoke linked to higher risk of stroke, India's salt intake too high and Kerala has the highest lifespan of 74.9 years","To ensure that you don't miss any noteworthy health news, we bring you a weekly roundup. Here is this week's aggregation of the latest news stories on health, fitness and diet. Secondhand smoke linked to higher risk of stroke The increased risk of stroke that comes with smoking may extend to nonsmokers who live in the same household and breathe in secondhand smoke, a U.S. study suggests. /India's salt intake twice the WHO-recommended mark The average salt intake in India is double that of the WHO-recommended maximum consumption level of 5 gm/day, says a study. Researchers at the George Institute for Global Health reviewed data involving 227,000 people across the country and found salt consumption ""far exceeds"" the World Health Organization (WHO) maximum target of just five grams per person each day. Kerala has the highest lifespan of 74.9 years How long will an Indian live after 60? It depends on which state you live in. In 1970-75, people's average lifespan in India was just 49.7 years. By 2010-14, it had increased to 67.9 years, an increase of 18.2 years. Another change that has taken place is that women are now living longer than men. Roadside trash burning ruining Indians' health The smoke from burning roadside trash piles - a common practice in India - contains such high concentration of particles that it can lead to 1,000 times more toxic exposures to nearby humans, warns a study by researchers at Duke University in the US. Diwali 2016: Protect your eyes this Diwali Diwali celebrations mean a lot of fun and enjoyment, but with incidents of eye injuries and even loss of eyesight being reported every year, it's crucial to take safety measures. In fact, eyes are the second-most common affected area during Diwali after hands and fingers.

State plans anti-cracker drive for cleaner air,"Kolkata: Alarmed over the deteriorating air quality of the city, which goes through the roof during Kali Puja and Diwali, the state government is planning a ""say no to crackers"" campaign next year. A study on the city's ambient air quality during the festival over last three years has prompted the government to go for the big push.Citing the report, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) is planning an aggressive awareness drive - through banners and hoardings and appeals on radio and TV - making Kolkatans conscious the ill-effects of smoke that belches out every time a cracker is burst.WBPCB has concluded that firecrackers had contributed to the worse air quality during Kali Puja, the levels spiked further in Diwali. The level of pollution called particulate matter, abbreviated as PM10 and fine particulate matter or PM 2.5 was 320 microgrammes per cubic metre and 193.5 mg/cubic metre, making Kolkata emerge as an air pollution hotspot during festivities. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards in India for PM2.5 is 60 microgram/m3 and that of PM10 is 100 microgram/m3. With cooler temperatures on November 10 and 11 (Diwali and Kali Puja), there was enough moisture in the air and the atmosphere holding capacity quite high for particles emitted by firecrackers, causing a dense haze. /Thanks to the humidity around the time, particles emitted from fireworks ""sat on water droplets and multiplied, resulting in more particles in the suspended air itself"", in a process called secondary particle formation.""Kolkata air, already brimming with pollutants, worsened with festival fireworks, the analysis shows,"" said WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra.The WBPCB data looks at the ""ambient"" or general pollution levels across the city, which is usually gathered at a height of 6m and often away from the sources of pollution. The ""exposure"" levels are closer to the nose and represent the air that is being breathed in. ""Exposure levels are usually three to four times higher than ambient levels. Crackers not only push up the pollution level but also lace it with deadly cancer-causing substances,"" said consultant pulmonologist Raja Dhar. According to Dhar, his hospital, Fortis, recorded a 40% increase in admissions related to COPD excerbations last year.Rudra said, ""Historically, Deepavali is the festival of lights and not burning crackers. It's time we reverted to our past, for the sake of the present and the future.""This year, WBPCB has started several stringent measures like intense raids to stop sale of sound crackers. ""But the more challenging task is to keep the air clean. For this, the anti-pollution body has started speaking to housing cooperatives so that they could start campaigns against firecrackers, even the silent ones that inflict so harm, especially on children and the elderly,"" said Rudra.Earlier this year, the CSE (Centre for Science and Environment) had found that the city's air pollution level is much higher than the permissible limit and recommended that Kolkata should start acting on emergency measures.Anumita Roychowdhury, head of CSE's air pollution control campaign, said, ""Toxic fumes are very high in Kolkata. The government should come up with implementation strategies to inform people to take precautions during Diwali, staying indoors on these days or asking children not to expose themselves to such firecrackers.""The sole silver-lining: the PC10 was lower last year than Kali Puja of 2014, when it had plummeted to 319, because wind velocity was slow. In all likelihood, the air quality during Diwali 2016 may not be inferior to that of Diwali 2015, thanks to warmer temperature and good wind speed.Finally, Prakash Javadekar, the Union minister of environment, forest and climate change, had appealed to children to refrain from bursting crackers in Delhi during Diwali.

"Haze blankets Delhi, air quality season's worst","NEW DELHI: Delhi's air quality recorded ""severe"" levels on Saturday, a day before Diwali. A pall of smog was hanging over the city since morning. As forecast by IMD and SAFAR, the wind speed was very low, touching zero at times, which caused pollutants to accumulate very close to the surface. /The Delhi government, meanwhile, blamed the high pollution levels on the farm stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. On Saturday, it shared a NASA image from October 26 showing crop fires in these states. ""Agricultural fires in the fields of neighbouring states, particularly Punjab and Haryana, are a major contributor in the deterioration of ambient air quality, which will accentuate due to inversion and calm meteorological conditions currently prevailing,"" a Delhi government statement said. Environment minister Imran Hussain reiterated his appeal to the residents to stay away from crackers on Diwali. The government had seized illegally-imported crackers at Qutab Roa, Moti Nagar, Rajouri Garden and Patel Nagar recently. This is the first time this season that the overall AQI (Air Quality Index) for the city recorded severe. A pollution emergency occurs when AQI is severe-even healthy people can be affected by such high levels of PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles). It can seriously affect those with existing health conditions. A 24-hour average pre-Diwali monitoring for three residential areas-RK Puram, Mandir Marg and Punjabi Bagh between 6am on October 28 and 6 am on October 29-showed the PM 2.5 average to be higher than 250 micrograms per cubic metres at RK Puram and Punjabi Bagh, more than four times the national safe standard and 10 times the WHO benchmark. The PM 10 average was 543 at RK Puram, which is five times the national safe standard and about 10 times the WHO cut-off mark. ""IMD had forecast that wind speed is going to drop and SAFAR had predicted air quality will be severe. The government should have issued a health advisory, urging people not to burn any crackers. Soft messages don't work,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of CSE's clean air campaign. ""There is enough evidence now that such high levels of pollution aggravate existing conditions and trigger heart attacks, strokes and other respiratory issues. In fact, pollution is responsible for more than 50% of heart attack cases."" The health ministry's steering committee report on air pollution lists mortality due to cardiovascular and respiratory disease, chronic respiratory disease incidence (asthma, COPD, etc), lung cancer, chronic cardiovascular disease, among others as a result of long-term exposure to high levels of pollution. If AQI continues to be severe for the next couple of days, it would fall under Beijing's red alert category when the Chinese capital shuts schools and industries, reduces power plant emissions and restricts car usage./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Festival of lights gives toxic touch to air,"KOLKATA: Brace for a tough time ahead if polluted air is already taking a toll on your health. The ambient air quality has been on the rise in the last few days in different parts of the city and it could shoot up to uncomfortable levels in the festive season.Air pollution data collected between October 24 and 26 across Kolkata indicates rising PM10 level. As per data collected by SAFE, a green NGO, the PM10 level at Dunlop crossing stood at 181 last Monday. It dropped marginally to 169 on Tuesday only to jump alarmingly to 193 on Wednesday. /The figure is expected to rise to scary level on the big two days - Kali Puja and Diwali.The city's deteriorating air quality has become a cause of concern over the last few years. According to data with the state pollution control board, the average PM10 and PM5 amount in the air has been increasing since 2013. While the PM10 amount during 2013-14 was more or less equal at 215 and 213, it shot up to a massive 320 in 2015. ""Air in northern parts of the city is more polluted, though it might not be only related to crackers. In some areas, road congestion leads to pollution as well,"" said Sudipto Bhattacharjee of SAFE.According to former chief environment law officer Biswajit Mukherjee, a plan should be chalked out to control air pollution. ""There was a plan discussed way back in 2011 to do something to prevent air pollution caused by firecrackers but it did not materialise. The issue should be looked into seriously now,"" he said.The Live monitoring on Kolkata US Consulate air pollution: Real time air pollution index (AQI) has predicted PM2.5 may hit 137-158 AQI near the US Consulate on Diwali night which is considered to be unhealthy. According to the pollution control board reading at one of the busy intersections, PM10 level reached 227.4 (pg/m3) by 6pm on Saturday evening.The higher the level of PM10 in air, the more it has an impact on human health. The sub-types of PM10, including the suspended particulate matter (SPM) and the respirable suspended particle (RSP), cause respiratory and other ailments, particularly among children and the elderly who suffer from asthma and other lung diseases.According to experts, pollution level increasing during Kalipujo and post Diwali is a routine affair but what is more alarming is the sudden rise of pollution due to bursting of firecrackers and its intensity. Not only PM 10, the toxicity of the air increases by the rise of sulphor dioxide. It takes long for air pollution to drop to normal levels since the onset of winter changes air density and that causes increase in harmful dust particles. Under the standards fixed by the Central Pollution Control Board, about 12 chemicals, including sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, SPM, RSP, ozone and lead, need to be measured to determine air quality.""Burning crackers leads to release of sulpher dioxide, carbon dixoide and nitrogen dioxide, among others, in the air. These gases lead to acute breathing problem. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients will have to be more careful. The toxic gas may also affect chronic bronchitis,"" said Debashis Saha, senior consulting physician at AMRI (Salt Lake). ""Pollution leads to cough among children. Mainly those suffering from asthma should be careful,"" added Neille Sarkar, Paeditrician of Ramkrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan. ""It becomes difficult to breathe during this time of the year. So I prefer to stay indoors,"" said Deepa Mehrotra, a librarian in a college who suffers from asthma./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Dollop of green thought before Diwali dash,"PUNE: Experts and citizens worried about firecracker pollution say it is not enough to quibble over annual marginal changes to tackle peak pollution during Diwali.They stress on the need to sensitize the community and to have in place a judicious mix of regulatory controls to protect public health.Air pollution is now the fifth-largest killer in India.Every year, 6.2 lakh premature deaths occur in India from air pollution-related diseases, according to `The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) report' by the World Health Organization.The New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), in a statement, observed several efforts are already under way to tackle this problem. These include noise regulations for firecrackers, a ban on unregulated Chinese firecrackers, time restrictions for firecrackers along with an advisory on distance from residence, schools and hospitals.Enforcement however, has posed a serious challenge.CSE executive director (research and advocacy) Anumita Roychowdhury says there is no room for additional pollution in cities, especially from firecrackers that not only push up the pollution spike, but also, lace it with deadly cancer-causing substances.""I think the ethos of celebrations will have to change. Any effort to stop this (bursting firecrackers) by force or issuing orders will not work as political parties will say celebrations are being targeted. People say there is garbage scattered everywhere, lakhs of vehicles emit poisonous smoke and overall cleanliness has gone for a toss.Then why target a five-day festival?/ There should be dialogue and sensitization,"" said Major Gen (rtd) S C N Ja tar, of city-based Nagrik Chetana Manch.""There are not many efforts taken to sensitize people about the severe impact of firecrackers. In Maharashtra, the Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti used to run a campaign against bursting firecrackers. But in recent times, there is no concentrated effort from organisations and government on this front,"" says Ashok Jadhav, a professional who feels the government must take a stand.Some nations, like China and the United Kingdom, have taken stringent steps in this regard. To cope with record smog, Beijing has emergency plans to curb air pollution. This includes a ban on fireworks when the city experiences three consecutive days of heavy smog. The city government has introduced a regulation requiring peo ple who buy five or more boxes of fireworks to register with an official ID. The city halts fireworks sales entirely if the pollution levels rise to dangerous levels. There are time and place restrictions, and all fireworks are labelled. Shanghai has reduced the city's number of authorized firework sellers after a fivefold increase in pollution levels fold during the fireworks extravaganza in 2013. The Fireworks Regula tion Act of 2004 prohibits the use of fireworks in England and Wales between 11pm and 7am, although extensions are given for special events.These regulations are strictly enforced by the police, and include fines up to \xA35,000 andor imprisonment for up to 6 months for selling or using fireworks illegally .This includes a spot fine of \xA390.TIMES VIEWEnough research has been done to prove firecrackers are hazardous to health, especially when air pollution levels in urban areas are already high. Health experts have warned of lungrelated problems after getting exposed to the smoke of crackers. The noisiest celebration of Diwali across the state was recorded in the Karve Road area last year. Many senior citizens have complained about trauma caused due to the blasting sound of crackers.Though some NGOs are campaigning in schools and even on roads promoting the idea of cracker-free Diwali, more such efforts are needed to sensitize people. Progressive nations have imposed a series of restrictions, including a cap on the sale of crackers to an individual, and imposition of fines on those bursting crackers beyond the stipulated time limit. While not everything can be left to the government, the state bodies, including the pollution control board, can make the real-time air quality data public when crackers are burst during festivities. Schools and educational institutions can use this data to educate students on the issue. Just a handful of NGOs alone will not be able to drive home the campaign for noiseless Diwali./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Activists expect pollution level to come down further,"LUDHIANA: As the air pollution in the city on Diwali has witnessed a gradual fall over the years, the organizations working for green Diwali hope that the pollution would further come down this year given the increased awareness among residents against smoke-producing crackers.As per the data of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) on pollution on Diwali day during the last few years, RSPM (respirable suspended particulate matter) witnessed a gradual decrease from 390 parts per million (ppm) in residential areas in 2012 to 148 ppm in 2015. The SO2 (sulfur dioxide) in residential areas too witnessed a fall from 30 ppm in 2012 to 12 ppm in 2015. The NOx (mono nitrogen oxides) too witnessed a decrease on Diwali day from 45 ppm in 2012 to 31ppm in 2014.There had been a fall in air pollution in commercial areas too on Diwali day. RSPM value which was 648 ppm in 2012 came down to 289 ppm in 2015. Similarly, SO2 and NOx values in commercial areas too had witnessed a fall. SO2 in such areas decreased from 24 ppm in 2012 to 18 ppm in 2015 whereas NOx decreased from 51 ppm to 40 ppm on Diwali day during the same time.The noise level for the city too has witnessed a decrease from 73.2 dB in 2011 to 69.1 dB in 2015. PPCB authorities too expressed satisfaction over the fall in the pollution on Diwali.""Though air pollution on Diwali continues to be a bit more than normal values, but it has witnessed a fall on Diwali over the last few years. /Our reports suggested that that there is decrease in the use of crackers in the city on Diwali. The credit for this goes to residents especially the ones who have created awareness about green Diwali,"" said Gulshan Rai, chief environmental engineer, Ludhiana, PPCB.The organizations which create awareness about green Diwali said there has been quite a change in people's mindset regarding crackers.""It is a great achievement for residents especially youngsters who have brought the change in attitude among the people. Instead of bursting crackers, more and more residents are switching over to green Diwali and diyas. We also have been educating youngsters to go for green Diwali,"" said Ravi Arora, founder member of Transformation of City, a group of NGOs and social groups working for city. Positive changeFrom being the most polluted city in the state, Ludhiana witnessed a positive change as the efforts of green activists have borne fruit and city has dropped down to number three in air pollution on Diwali last year. The noise levels in the city too were recorded less than Patiala, but higher than Amritsar and Jalandhar./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Cloaked in haze all year as rules to curb pollution bite the dust,"GURGAON: Residents of the city's most-sought after address face another trying winter as the dusty haze created by the twin infrastructure projects on Golf Course Road adds to pollution levels that are already in the year's worst phase. Both projects, one to upgrade Golf Course Road into a 16-lane expressway and the other the second phase of Rapid Metro, have involved large-scale excavation, demolition and construction, driving up pollution levels and creating traffic bottlenecks. And with both projects overshooting deadlines, residents say their patience is running thin. /Air quality in NCR plummets in winter but Golf Course Road is cloaked in a dusty haze all year. In that aspect, winter is a dreaded time for local residents. Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) data shows the average level of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in Gurgaon has increased from 350 \xB5g/m3 in 2015 to 415 \xB5g/m3 in 2016. The board has attributed it to construction activities in new sectors of Gurgaon. ""That is why large parts of the city remain covered in a layer of dust,"" said a senior HSPCB official. Golf Course Road's makeover has also been a contributor to this, the official added. Most construction sites in Gurgaon do not follow guidelines issued by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) and the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to check dust pollution. Unfortunately, Golf Course Road has been no different. The most elementary of the norms - covering construction material like sand or mounds of earth with sheets to prevent particles from flying - is the most widely flouted.""None of the construction sites is covered as the norms mandate,"" said Rajkumar Saini, a resident of Alaknanda society in Sector 56, abutting Golf Course Road. ""The area is filled with dust as roads are dug up and construction material on trucks is not covered. Sometimes, it is difficult to breathe."" Manoj Pandey, a resident of Sukh Shanti Apartments nearby, said a permanent haze has hung over neighbourhoods around the road for several years now since both projects took off. ""Traffic jams are rampant too. There has been no effort to mitigate that while construction is under way,"" he said. Mahesh Dayma, councillor in MCG House whose term came to an end this May, said his office was flooded with complaints from residents about pollution, but no action has been taken by any government agency. Yet, with both the new expressway and Rapid Metro corridor nearing the finish line, the situation isn't as bad this year as last year or the year before. In places where construction is still on, environmentalists say following the guidelines can reduce pollution even if they can't completely stop it in projects of this magnitude. ""There are several factors that contribute to air pollution. Dust from construction sites is a major contributor in this region,"" said environmentalist Vivek Kamboj./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Punjab says no money for technology to stop crop burning,"CHANDIGARH: There is little chance of any let-up in air pollution in Punjab and the states of Delhi and Haryana post-Diwali as Punjab has expressed its inability to provide farmers money for alternative technology, citing lack of funds.Following a rebuke from National Green Tribunal (NGT) on paddy burning last week, a cash-starved Punjab government has told the Centre that it does not have the money to implement its orders .The Delhi government released a NASA image dated October 26 showing a haze blanket across north India due to crop residue burning in Haryana and Punjab, saying it was having a major adverse effect on the city's air quality.A note sent by the Punjab government to the Centre, accessed by TOI, says, ""The finance department observes that to implement the National Green Tribunal orders of October 19, 2015, on making agricultural equipment and machinery available to all concerned farmers by the state government... the expenditure is around Rs 1,583 crore. It is difficult for the finance department to make these funds available.""It is therefore advised that the administrative department may approach the central government for providing a grant and the state can only provide nominal share if required."" The machines needed to stop paddy burning are paddy straw, chopper shredder (16,000), happy seeder (13,400), rotavator (10,000), M B Plough (11,450), rake (5,400) and baler (5,400).In 2014 and 2015, the Punjab government could provide only 14,173 rotavators, 392 happy seeders and 5086 zero till drills.The Akali Dal government is now mopping up funds by fining the farmers caught burning the stubble anything between Rs 2,500 and Rs 15,000.Despite repeated attempts, agriculture minister Tota Singh or finance minister Parminder Dhindsa were not available for comment.Congress spokesperson Sunil Jakhar says the note ex poses the Parkash Singh Badal government. /""This is an admission that they are bankrupt, and are unconcerned about the farmers' welfare or about protecting the environment"".Punjab is facing a debt of Rs 1.34 lakh crore and had recently pledged 12 state-owned properties for a loan of Rs 2,100 crore to support its subsidies and state schemes.""Burning of paddy residue causes smog and air pollution.It also poses a significant threat as it leads to breathing difficulty, allergies and asthma attacks.

Extreme Rise in Air pollution in Patna: 16 times above WHO safe limits,"PATNA: The city had witnessed 'Severe' air quality, which may cause severe respiratory and cardiac ailments to healthy person on prolonged exposure. Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) on Monday released data from the 24 hour monitoring of the ambient air quality during Pre-Diwali and Diwali days.Despite the awareness drive on 'Say No To Crackers' undertaken by the Bihar Government, the recent data for Diwali suggests that the government must issue health warnings and regulate certain sources of pollution.The data says that the ambient air quality of Patna has deteriorated alarmingly on the night of Diwali. The levels of PM 10 and PM 2.5 spiked maximum 1.4 and 3 times higher than the concentration noted during days (October 25 -29, 16) before Diwali at the same duration, said CEED programme manager Ankita Jyoti.""The concentration of particulate matter (PM 2.5) has shot up to 6.6 times above the prescribed national ambient air quality standard and 15.8 times above World Health Organization safety limits"", Jyoti who analysed the data told TOI on Monday. /Diwali is the auspicious festival of light and crackers but every year it leads to the deposition of immense amount of toxic pollutant in the atmosphere. A comprehensive and vigilant data was monitored in Patna at four different areas, namely Dak Bungalow, Patna City, Sultanganj and Bhikhna Pahari. The air quality at Dak Bungalow on the day of Diwali was noted to be the worst among all the areas.The particulate matter (PM)concentrations compared during the pre-Diwali and Diwali days within a time frame of 18:00 pm to 22:00 pm had shown an increase of 67.2% in PM 2.5 level. ""The continuous evaluation of the pollution level on Diwali indicates the air quality in severe zone and which will continue to remain in the coming two days"", Jyoti said..The general trend showed that the concentration of particulate matter started rising after 6 pm on Diwali night and reached to the worst at late night hours. The pollution level found highest in time range of 22:01 PM- 00:00 AM, while the hours during late Morning and Noon is comparatively less polluted. The data computed clearly explains how the smoke caused by fireworks completely blanketed the city by midnight, data says.Ankita Jyoti elucidates that due to the excessive use of fireworks on Diwali, a lethal cocktail of smoke is formed over Patna which remains trapped for days since the atmospheric holding capacity of pollutant has increased with stagnant wind and high humidity./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"In Delhi, air quality deteriorates to 'severe' levels on Diwali night","NEW DELHI: As predicted by pollution monitoring agencies, the air quality on Diwali (Sunday) recorded 'severe' levels. Thick smog and a smell of smoke in the air around midnight made it obvious that air quality had deteriorated drastically compared to the day and early evening before firecrackers were burst. (SAFAR PM 2.5 running average at midnight)System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting Research (SAFAR) under the ministry of earth sciences (MoES) website (monitors 8 locations) at around 12.30 am on Monday showed a running PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) average of 283 micrograms per cubic metres for the city which is more than 4 times the national standard and about eleven times the World Health Organisation (WHO) standard. /(At Anand Vihar PM 2.5 levels peaked to more than 800 micrograms per cubic metres after 1 am on Monday morning)Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) website which monitors six locations showed huge peaks in both PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels after 9 pm on most locations they monitor. For example, in RK Puram PM 2.5 concentrations peaked to 647 micrograms per cubic matter following which there was a gap in their monitoring until midnight when again levels were around 690 micrograms per cubic metres, at Anand Vihar PM 2.5 levels peaked to more than 800 micrograms per cubic metres after 1 am on Monday morning. PM 10 (coarse, pollution particles) peaked to as high as 1600 micrograms per cubic metres at Anand Vihar at around 3 am on Monday, about 1400 micrograms per cubic metres at 3 am on Monday at RK Puram, this about 28 times the WHO 24 hour guideline. The wind speed which was well over 1.50 metres per second at most locations on Sunday morning and afternoon fell to 0 or 0.3 metres per second which made it even more difficult for emissions from firecrackers to disperse. DPCC, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and SAFAR are likely to release air pollution analysis for Diwali either today or on Tuesday./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Delayed monsoon ensures dry Diwali, but air quality takes a hit","A delayed northeast monsoon not only gives jitters to the city's water managers, but can also worry those monitoring its air quality index. Rainfall reduced pollution levels last Diwali but this year, with no rain, it has gone up again. The respirable suspended particulate matter count, an indicator of air pollution, almost doubled in overcrowded neighbourhoods like Triplicane and Sowcarpet, according to data released by Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.All neighbourhoods, where air quality was surveyed, recorded pollution levels way above the permissible limit. /Besant Nagar and T Nagar recorded the lowest count of PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 micrometres in diameter) on Diwali. The two neighbourhoods recorded 102 micrograms per cubic metre and 113 micrograms per cubic metre, marginally above the permissible limit (100 micrograms per cubic metre) recommended as per the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.Apart from increasing the presence of particulate matter in the air, the explosion of crackers sent the sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions shooting up. They were, however, within the permissible limit of 80 micrograms per cubic metre. Nungambakkam and Triplicane recorded the highest SO2 and NO2 levels.Former TNPCB member-secretary K Karthikeyan attributed the drop in pollution last Diwali to rainfall. ""While the rain reduced use of firecrackers, it also helped disperse clouds of smoke that would have otherwise lingered and poisoned the air.Rain droplets helped in turning SO2 to sulphate aerosol and its subsequent dispersion,"" he said.Keeping with the high pollution levels, the number of cases of respiratory illnesses reported at city clinics and hospitals went up. Asthma specialist Dr R Sridharan reported a 50% increase in the number of patients at his clinic Mylapore. Dr Sridharan said the cases could increase in numbers and intensity in the coming weeks as the north east monsoon has set in.""There will be an increase in the fungal spores count due to humidity which builds up after rainfall. Moreover moisture-rich air keeps allergens tightly suspended in the air for a long time. This will flare up ailments leading to acute asthma, sinus and nasal allergies, apart from aggravation of skin abnormalities,"" Dr Sridharan said.The risk of respiratory infections will peak during December when the air is still and particulate matter is suspended for longer duration, he said.Noise levels this Diwali were similar to the previous two years, recording slight variations.Last year, T Nagar recorded 126 decibels (dB) noise, almost three times higher than the permissible limit (45dB). It came down to 81 dB this time. Triplicane was the loudest this Diwali where the noise level went up from 73 dB on Saturday to 88 dB on Sunday ./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution behind 1 in 10 under-5 deaths',"A report by the United Nations Children's agency , Unicef, released on Monday has confirmed the worst fears of people living in polluted areas -that bad air is contributing to death of many children even before they celebrate their fifth birthday.Outdoor and indoor pollution, the agency noted, are directly linked to respiratory diseases that account for almost one in 10 under-five deaths, making air pollution one of the leading dangers to children's health.

A quiet Diwali sees air pollution in Bengaluru remain 'moderate',"BENGALURU: All of two years old, Ira decided to step out of her flat in an apartment complex in Yeshwantpur to go down and meet her friends, who were busy bursting crackers. However, the smoke-filled air reverberating with the cacophonous din, and the plight of the dogs and the pigeons made her averse to crackers. Ira is in the habit of keeping rice and water in her balcony for the pigeons. /Interestingly enough, her mother, Madhurima Das, a research associate at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), has not burst a cracker for more than a decade. ""We had a quiet Diwali. Neither I nor my spouse burst crackers. Also, being asthmatic doesn't help. Although the festival gets over, its effects linger for a while. But, I felt that the situation was a tad better this year,"" she said.Across Bengaluru, a large number of citizens made a conscious choice to celebrate a quiet Deepavali. Sarita Gupta, a resident of Malleswaram, said, ""We had a fabulous puja, which was attended by family and friends. We lit mud lamps and placed flowers everywhere in the house. We also wanted to brighten the lives of others and so sent food, sweets and clothes to an orphanage.""Noting a perceptible decline in the amount of crackers burst this year, Sarita added, ""We had a designated area in the building for bursting crackers. The amount of dirt there was much lesser compared to the previous years.""Concurring with the observations made by the residents, officials of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) said that pollution levels were much lesser in comparison to last year.The National Air Quality index, which provides real-time data on air pollution indicated that particulates that could travel deep into the respiratory tract were the prominent pollutants on Sunday. Exposure to these particles could lead to short-term health problems in the eye, nose, lungs and throat. While the maximum level of particulate matter touched 436g/m3 and the average was 11 g/ m3. On Sunday, the carbon-mono-oxide remained the major pollutant, touching 103g/ m3 in the morning. The average CO levels remained at 56g/ m3. Particulate matter was the main pollutant in Peenya, while the air quality index (AQI) was 199 on Saturday. It remained the same on Sunday as well. PM 2.5 levels are commonly used as the best indicator of severe air pollution, while PM 10 particles are a cause of public health concern, but less lethal.In the other air quality monitoring centres, at City Railway Station and SG Halli, particulate matter, CO and Nitrogen Dioxide were the main pollutants over the past three days./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

I think it's due to an increase in the use of substandard crackers,"" said Niranjan Raje, a former member of the expert appraisal committee of the ministry of environment, forests and climate change and a member of Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority .Doctors feel rising air pollution is a matter of concern.""We've already started getting cases of choking and aggravation of respiratory tract, particularly in the elderly and children,"" said Dr Himanshu Garg, head of the department of respiratory diseases and critical care, Artemis Hospital.Officials at the Met department said the situation might become worse in November.""Due to low wind speed and moisture in the air, it is likely that suspended pollutants remain trapped in the lower atmosphere,"" said an official./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
City gasps for breath as air pollution levels shoot up,"BAREILLY: Green activists’ anti-firecracker campaign went up in smoke on Diwali night with the city recording nearly eight times the normal amount (100 g/m3) of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in the air. Noise level was also four times the standard limit (40 decibels) and 891.28 micrograms per metre cube of RSPM was recorded on Diwali which is eight times the standard rate of 100 micrograms per metre cube./RSPM is causative agent of mortality and morbidity. Fine particles on their own or with combination with other air pollutants are linked with a number of health problems like premature death, aggravated asthma and acute respiratory symptoms./The level of RSPM at IVRI on Diwali was recorded at 579.98g/m3 against the 153.11g/m3 of RSPM on a normal day. At Rajendra Nagar, it was recorded at 788.23g/m3 against the 167.8g/m3 of RSPM on a normal day while at Civil Lines, it was 891.28g/m3 against the 179.3g/m3. The recordings were made over a 24-hour period from 3 pm to 3 am./Speaking with TOI, Dinesh K Saxena, professor, Botany department, Bareilly College, said, “Toxic fumes from firecrackers worsen killer particles in the air that have already increased by eight times than the safe standards. They also deposit deadly chemicals in our environment that remain for days.” This harms health of not only those who suffer from respiratory and cardiac problems but even normal healthy people, he added./Noise pollution was also recorded at all time high in these areas of the city. The ambient noise level was recorded at 79 decibles on Diwali at IVRI against the 20 decibles on any normal day and at Rajendra Nagar, it was 91 decibles against 39 decibles while, the noise level at Civil Lines was recorded at 83 decibles against 45 decibles on the normal day./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Action plan: Nothing on buses, odd-even","NEW DELHI: The Delhi government on Tuesday announced an action plan to deal with the severe pollution this winter. This includes a crackdown on construction sites violating norms, reviving the Swachch Delhi app, re-starting vacuum cleaning of streets and sprinkling of water on arterial roads to tamp down the dust.Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, however, didn't mention any plan to upgrade public transport like getting buses to meet the deficit. Besides, he didn't comment on whether the odd-even strategy or any other emergency step would be implemented again when air quality worsened further. ""We will re-start vacuum cleaning of roads. /It was stopped during the monsoon. We are facing some problems in the tendering process to procure machines. For now, we will use whatever we have,"" said Sisodia.Currently, there are only two vacuum cleaners with corporations. According to officials, these machines do not function well on colony roads. A senior official said that initially, the South Corporation had outsourced the work to three private agencies, but later on, retained only two of them. ""We have two mechanical sweepers and they work during night. The problem with these machines is that they don't work properly on uneven surface and most of the roads are not well maintained,"" the official added. In 2010, the erstwhile MCD had outsourced the vacuum-cleaning of arterial roads to a private firm, which deployed 29 sweeping machines across the city. But the project failed to make any progress.Sisodia said initiatives were being taken to ensure residents can complain against the 61 construction sites (more than 20,000sq m in size), which are being monitored by the environment department. He added that people can also complain against smaller construction projects through an app. The Swachch Delhi app may be re-launched for this purpose. The government will penalise officials who are not able to check waste burning in their areas. The superintending officers of various parks will be challaned if there is any waste burning in parks while sanitary inspectors will be fined if this menace is detected on roads.""We will to reduce emissions from the cremation grounds as well. Since a large number of people use wood for cremation, a lot of emissions come from crematoriums. We plan to get chimneys installed so that smoke can be tapped. This will be done in coordination with municipal corporations,"" Sisodia added. Other measures to tackle air pollution include sprinkling of water on certain roads as well as installing mist fountains and air purifiers at five major intersections.But the government didn't announce any timeline for these actions to be taken. Experts say the government's focus should be on combustion sources such as vehicles and waste burning since emissions from these are the highest in winter while road dust is a significant polluter in summer. ""What about controlling emissions from vehicles? Where is the initiative for public transport? Emissions from the Badarpur power plant also needs to be addressed. They need to issue health advisories and determine how they will tackle pollution peaking episodes. They also need to monitor impact of their actions on air quality and calibrate action accordingly,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of CSE's clean air campaign.The government announced these measures following a high-level meeting, which was attended by health minister Satyendar Jain, environment minister Imran Hussain, chief secretary K K Sharma and senior officials from PWD, DPCC, DJB and the environment department./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
One in every ten child dies of air pollution,"Outdoor and indoor pollution, the agency noted, are directly linked to respiratory diseases that account for almost one in 10 under-five deaths, making air pollution one of the leading dangers to children's health. On Diwali, southern cities like Chennai and Bengaluru recorded satisfactory air quality. A drizzle in Kolkata helped clear the air. But all northern cities suffered “severe” pollution as predicted by various pollution monitoring agencies./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Simple ways to purify your indoor air,"Nine out of 10 people globally are breathing poor quality air. Yet, oblivious to the dangers of indoor pollution, when we speak of pollution we only refer to outdoor pollution. Jayati Singh, Business Head, Air, Philips India adds, ""Indoor air is 3-5 times more polluted than the outdoor air because it is a mix of outdoor pollution that comes in through windows and doors as well as indoor pollutants like dust, cooking fumes, allergens, incense, cigarette smoke and pet dander.""According to a recent survey conducted by Artemis Hospital under the Clean Air India Movement, due to unhealthy indoor air quality, about 31 per cent of the survey respondents had some kind of airway disease and 46 per cent people were found to have symptoms suggesting a respiratory disease.Dr Amol Kumar, Pulmonologist, from iCliniq says, ""Indoor air pollution is wreaking havoc on the sleeping patterns of people, thus leading to multiple ailments. /The right home air purifier can help us sleep better and prevent sinus and breathing problems as it will remove dust and allergens from the air and leave us breathing easier and even reduce snoring.""Here are some easy ways to prevent your indoor air from getting worse: Monitor indoor pollutionYou can download a pollution mapping mobile application to monitor air inside your house. Also, keep your windows and doors closed in the wee hours and early morning, as that is the time when pollution is at its worst.Use chimney to filter cooking fumesResearchers have established that cooking fumes are cancerous and contribute greatly to contaminating indoor air. While cooking, always keep the exhaust fan on (and use chimney). Also, it is important to clean grease traps on regular intervals. Avoid smoking indoorsSmoking is a big health hazard and it can permeate into your environment. So it's best to avoid smoking indoors and you are also advised to wash your hands and face after smoking.Keep air-purifying plantsHouseplants can help you purify indoor air. They absorb particulates in the air and then process it into oxygen via photosynthesis. Plants like chrysanthemum (Garden mum), spider plant, weeping fig and peace lily are some of the indoor plants you can consider keeping at your home.Change bed linen regularlyChange your bed sheet and pillow covers at least twice a week and always use clean blankets. Regularly washing curtains is also a healthy practice to prevent indoor air pollution. Avoid moisture from getting trappedClean your house well and prevent moisture since dust and mites strive on moisture. High moisture inside the house leads to mold growth and is also associated with respiratory issues. Use exhaust fan while cooking and even in the bathroom after shower; put the clothes' dryer outside, don't put too much water in houseplants and make sure there are no leaky plumbing to prevent mold. Get your electronic devices, especially air conditioners serviced regularly and use dehumidifier./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Health ministry's plan to focus on lung disorder,"NEW DELHI: The Union health ministry will soon release, what is being called the ""New Delhi declaration on mitigating effects of air pollution"". This will offer a time-bound action plan to different ministries to address various sources of air pollution. The health ministry has also decided to include chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD)-a health condition closely associated with exposure to toxic air-in the non-communicable diseases (NCD) programme.It has recently held a meeting with the steering committee constituted to look into air pollution. The panel released a report in August last year and had been discussing the need to include COPD in NCD programme since then but the ministry finally took the decision to include it only last month. /""All states have been asked to include COPD in the NCD programme. The issue will also be discussed with all BRICS nations during our meetings on November 17 and 18 because all these nations are affected by this problem,"" said Dr Damodar Bachani, deputy commissioner (non-communicable diseases) at the health ministry. This would mean that along with diabetes, cancer, hypertension and others, NCD clinics will start screening people for COPD too from now on. ""All clinics will have spirometers that can measure the lung capacity. Assistance will be provided to make nebulizers, bronchodilators and relevant antibiotics available. We always knew that COPD was the second largest killer after heart disease in the NCD category. Our decision to include it was triggered by the steering committee report on air pollution,"" Dr Bachani added.Experts have hailed this move. ""Declaring COPD as part of non-communicable diseases gives a message to policy makers to take action on environmental factors as well as lifestyle, which would also mean promoting walking and cycling,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of CSE's clean air programme.Representatives of various ministries agreed to release the pollution declaration, which will focus on preventing health problems. ""The fundamental message emerging out of the newly available data is that premature death and disease can be prevented through healthier environments,"" a concept note by the health ministry says. A senior official said that the action plan might be released this week since air pollution levels were already very high.""The declaration will have several points, including the supply of cleaner fuels to urban slums and rural areas, which are dependent on biomass burning and reducing exposure of vulnerable people to bad air in the early morning and evening hours,"" added the official./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Health ministry to release declaration on mitigating impacts of air pollution,"NEW DELHI: The union health ministry will soon be releasing a ""New Delhi declaration on mitigating effects of air pollution"" which will give time bound action points to other ministries to address various sources of air pollution related to their ministry.The health ministry recently held a meeting with the steering committee on air pollution which had released a report on air pollution and health impacts in August last year. The health ministry has also decided to include chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), a health condition closely associated with exposure to severe air pollution, under the non-communicable diseases (NCD) programme. All states have been asked to include COPD under NCD. ""COPD will also be discussed with all BRICS nations in our meeting on NCD on November 17 and 18 because all these nations are affected,"" said Dr Damodar Bachani, deputy commissioner (non-communicable diseases) at the health ministry.The steering committee meeting attended by representatives of all ministries agreed to release the declaration which will focus on preventing air pollution related health impacts. /""Over 6 lakh deaths and about 18 million disability adjusted life years are attributable to air pollution in India...the fundamental message emerging out of the newly available data is that premature death and disease can be prevented through healthier environments,"" a concept note by the health ministry read. ""Most ministries participated and agreed on the action points put forth by the steering committee. Now these points have to be cleared by the secretary, health before we release the declaration.We may release it this week since air pollution levels are very high already,"" said a senior official.The steering committee on air pollution was formed in 2014 and is chaired by Dr K Srinath Reddy, President of Public Health Foundation of India, Ambuj Sagar, IIT Delhi professor and Kirk Smith, professor of Global Environment Health, University of California, Berkeley. The committee's work is being coordinated by Dr Damodar Bachani, deputy commissioner (non-communicable diseases) at the health ministry.""The declaration will have several points. But the top three are to target and curb every source of air pollution, supply of cleaner fuels to urban slums and rural areas that are dependent on biomass burning, reducing exposure of vulnerable persons by avoiding early morning and evening hours when air quality is very poor,"" added the official.The steering committee's 2015 report also focused on reducing exposure to air pollution. It collated evidence on health impacts from outdoor and indoor air pollution and suggested measures for each source of pollution like-vehicles, biomass burning, diesel generator sets, road and construction dust, brick kilns, industries and power plants. Since the committee's mandate is health, it also stresses on monitoring exposure of individuals rather than depending on the ambient air quality data. The recommendations of the steering committee were accepted by the health ministry last year following which the report was circulated to rest of ministries and their comments were sought. ""We have received comments from most ministries. This is the first time that air pollution is being dealt with through health policy,"" explained the official.Recommendations that will be immediately rolled out are to campaign against certain kinds of Diwali crackers, LPG supply to slums, reliable power supply to slums, an health advisory for the vulnerable population (pregnant women, children below five years, elders above 60 and those who are sick). ""If FM radio can tell you which roads to avoid due to traffic, it can also tell you the air quality in different parts of the city. We are urging that data dissemination is more transparent so that people can reduce their exposure to toxic air. We are also considering developing an health advisory,"" the official added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Bhubaneswar witnesses less pollution this Diwali,"BHUBANESWAR: Even as images of a smog-filled Delhi did the rounds, this year Odisha's capital city witnessed a dip in air pollution in the aftermath of the Diwali celebrations. The air pollution reading taken on Sunday by the Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB) showed a significant decrease as against last year.The pollution panel has installed six pollution monitoring devices at Patrapada, IRC village, OSPCB office at Nayapalli, Capital police station, Rasulgarh and OSPCB laboratory at Chandrasekharpur to monitor pollution on a regular basis. Pollution board sources said last year in Diwali, the particulate matter (PM-10) in ambient air was as high as 700 micrograms per metre cube. /But this year it has been found to be 324 micrograms per metre cube in IRC village area. The pollution panel felt due to reduction in the sale of Chinese crackers, which emanates more smoke, the ambient air pollution has come down. ""Although the ambient air quality continued to be beyond the permissible limit, this Diwali it is far less compared to the previous year,"" said OSPCB regional officer (Bhubaneswar), Hadibandhu Panigrahi. During last year's Diwali, air pollution (PM-10) near OSPCB office (Nayapalli) was found to be 511 micrograms per metre cube while this year it was 190. The ambient air this year was found to meet the standard parameter at OSPCB regional laboratory with the monitoring device recording PM-10 as 100 micrograms per metre cube. Last year, it was 274. The noise level this Diwali was also comparatively less as it was found to be in the region of 80 decibels compared to 85 last year. On normal days it remains between 65 and 70 decibels, which is on the higher side. In September, the pollution panel had issued an advisory to the Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) to submit a plan of action to check air pollution.The pollution panel had said in its letter that BDA should prevent parking of vehicles in non-designated areas to check concentration of vehicular emission. It had also asked the BDA to plan de-congesting the roads. ""The suspension and suppression of dust on the roads is an important factor that has to be taken into account to minimize air pollution. For this, the open spaces in the city will have to be turned into a green canopy,"" said an OSPCB officer./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air, noise pollution only a tad higher this Diwali","TRICHY: The city witnessed a slight increase in air and noise pollution levels on the night of Diwali compared to the previous year.The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) had installed air quality monitors at three places in the city. Air quality is monitored in terms of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5) count and SO2 and NO2 levels in the air.Woraiyur recorded the highest PM 10 in the city at 154 micrograms per cubic metre against the national permissible limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre. Gandhi market was not far behind with 115 micrograms per cubic metre followed by Bishop Heber College at 71 micrograms per cubic metre. /However, the level of SO2 and NO2 were well within the limits in the city. Officials attributed the rise in pollution to the lack of rain this Diwali, unlike last year. Experts said that a person exposed to such suspended particulates could face respiratory diseases, asthma and wheezing. They said that elders and children were more vulnerable to dust and air pollution which affects their lungs resulting in respiratory problems. Dust reduces the capacity of lungs to inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. In terms of noise pollution, the city recorded 82.3 decibels noise compared to 81.2 decibels last year. The permissible limit of noise level in residential areas is 55 and 45 decibels during the day and the night respectively. The TNPCB had installed sound level meter at Thillai Nagar in the city. Founder of Voice Trust A Gregory said that while western countries have largely shunned high decibel crackers during festivals, things have not changed in India. Planting of trees will help in stopping dust particles from entering the house and also bring down the amount of particles in the air./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
