Air pollution highest since 2013 this Diwali,"PUNE: Air pollution in the city during Diwali festivities was at its worst this year since 2013, scientists at System for Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said on Wednesday after an analysis. They also found the air quality index high on October 30, 31 and November 1, the main days of the festival.A study for the period between 2013 and 2016 shows that there was maximum emission of smoke from the use of fire crackers on Laxmi Puja day and a day after. /This year, a nip in the air added to the pollution.If the air quality index is between 201-300, it is categorized as poor and if it is between 301-400, it is considered very poor, indicating health risks for people sensitive to air pollution. This year, it was 192 and fell under the moderate level, but was the highest since 2013. ""Pune's air quality levels have ranged from moderate to very poor during Diwali. However, it is expected to improve over the next three days with a rise in the minimum temperatures,'' SAFAR's senior programme officer Neha Parkhi said. A dip in minimum temperatures, low wind speed and emissions from fire crackers on Diwali day has pushed up the air quality index, an indicator to measure pollution levels.The PM 2.5 and PM 10 (coarser particles) levels for Mumbai were also on the higher side touching 145.9 as against 60 microgrammes per cubic meter./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Diwali revelry: Varanasi choked, sky covered with smog","VARANASI: The temple city's air pollution levels reached alarming levels following the celebrations on the day after Diwali, and enveloped the city in a thick cover of smog. As per the figures revealed by Care4Air, a campaign by Whistle Blower Trust, the level of particulate matter in the air on Monday was 15-20 times more than the level set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Talking to reporters on Wednesday, chief campaigner of Care4Air, Ekta Shekhar said ""Pollution levels were monitored with the help of a real time monitoring mechanism at as many as 13 places across the city, the morning after Diwali. The air quality was found highly toxic and has triggered concerns about public health. /The device was jointly prepared by IndiaSpend and experts of IIT-Kanpur.""As per their monitoring mechanism, the ultra pollutant, PM 2.5 (particles that measure less than 2.5 microns in diameter), breached the standard by over 20 times at Sonarpura crossing. The levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10 were recorded to be 990 and 687.9 micrograms per cubic metres respectively. The prescribed standard for PM 2.5 is 60 while for PM 10, which is slightly bigger than PM 2.5 but very harmful for the respiratory system, is 100. Burning of firecrackers and burning of waste in open air were held responsible for the rise in air pollution in Varanasi.Many other areas including the densely populated Godowlia crossing and Lanka had nearly similar readings between 6-10am on October 31 morning, when vehicular pollution was minimal. Shekhar said, ""According to CPCB's findings, air pollution was marginally higher than last year as PM 2.5 and PM 10 ranged between 380 micrograms per cubic metre and 341 micrograms per cubic metre, while last year (November 12, 2015), it was recorded at 305 and 256 micrograms per cubic metre respectively"".""On Monday morning, Varanasi woke up to a highly polluted air, as smoke from Diwali fireworks, coupled with moisture and nearly stagnant wind movement, shrouded the city in a thick cover of smog at a time when the vehicular emission was minimal,"" she said, adding that air samples at tourist places like Sarnath, too, was alarmingly high with PM 2.5 and 10 being recorded at 463 and 419 micrograms per cubic metre respectively while Chowk area recorded lowest pollution levels. City-based pulmonologist and physician, Dr. RN Vajpayee, said ""Prolonged exposure to PM 2.5 and PM 10 can harm the respiratory system as the ultra fine particulates can find their way deep into the lungs and also enter the bloodstream"". He said that the volume of sulphur dioxide (SO2), which can aggravate asthma, also breached safe standards, indicating that the crackers contained a high level of sulphur./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Gurgaon: You can't see and you can't breathe,"GURGAON: The city was blanketed in thick smog on a grey, brooding Wednesday that saw pollution levels reach nearly 14 times the safe standard. An overcast sky added to the general gloominess with visibility so poor that it completely engulfed the city's impressive skyline and buildings as little as 200 metres away went beyond a cloak of haze. Concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 touched the 800 mark in the afternoon, which was almost 14 times higher the national safe standard. The average 24-hour level of PM 2.5 (measured between 4pm on Tuesday and 4pm on Wednesday) was 423.62 micrograms per cubic metre (\xB5g/m\xB3), still seven times higher than the safe standard of 60. According to officials at the Met department, the situation is going to get worse in the coming days. /""If it doesn't rain or wind speed doesn't increase, the situation is likely to get worse. Better sunshine can also make a difference. It is expected that sunshine will be a little better on Sunday onwards,"" said an official of Met department.According to the data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), concentration of PM2.5 has constantly increased since Diwali (October 31). While the 24-hour average concentration of PM2.5 was 212.96\xB5g/m\xB3 on October 30 (from 2pm on October 29 to 2pm on October 30), it increased to 217.45\xB5g/m\xB3 on October 31. The level further rose to 328.15\xB5g/m\xB3 on November 1 and reached 381.50\xB5g/m\xB3 on November 2. As per WHO, concentration of PM2.5 shouldn't be more than 60\xB5g/m\xB3.However, other air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and ozone remained below the prescribed limit. While Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) blamed rise in air pollution in Delhi for conditions in Millennium City, experts said the authorities have not taken enough measures to deal with the problem, primarily by not being able to check stubble burning at farms.""There are emergency measures which authorities should have taken after Gurgaon and its neighbouring cities reported an increase in concentration of PM2.5. These could have included closing down polluting industries for 15-20 days, reducing vehicular traffic in the city, making changes in school timings and issuing precautionary advice to children, the elderly and pregnant women,"" said Niranjan Raje, a former member of the expert appraisal committee at the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change, and a member of Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA).""If you look at the average PM2.5 concentration in Gurgaon on October 30 and 31, it was below 250\xB5g/m\xB3. However, the level was much higher in Delhi. The level is increasing in Gurgaon since October 31. It indicates that particulate matter has travelled from Delhi to Gurgaon,"" said an HSPCB official.Refuting that claim, professor Sushil Dayal, a city-based environmental scientist, said, ""Wind speed is already very low. It is unlikely that particulate matter could travel so easily. Like Delhi, Gurgaon too reported a rise in air pollution owing to burning of firecrackers, along with stubble burning.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Diwali air over north India was world's worst,"Over the Diwali weekend of 2016, India’s air quality was among the world’s worst and between 40% and 100% worse in five north Indian cities than at the same time the preceding year, according to global air pollution data and an IndiaSpend analysis of national data and our #Breathe network of sensors./On October 30 and 31, 2016, from 9 pm to the wee hours of the next morning, North India–especially parts of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar–recorded PM 2.5 levels of over 500 µg/m³–exhibiting “beyond scale” pollution values, according to the database run by Berkeley Earth, an independent US research organisation./PM 2.5 is fine particulate matter about 30 times finer than a human hair. These particles can be inhaled deep into the lungs, causing heart attacks, strokes, lung cancer and respiratory diseases, and are known to pose the greatest risk to human health. Their measurement is considered to be the best indicator of the level of health risks from air pollution, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)./For this analysis, IndiaSpend compared 2016 Diwali air-quality data (October 23 to November 1) from our #Breathe monitors–in Lucknow, Agra and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Patna in Bihar, and two locations in Delhi–with air-pollution data recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in similar locations over the same Diwali period (November 4 to 13) in 2015./South Delhi’s 24-hour average PM 2.5 levels in 2016 were 38% higher than on Diwali night 2015. The next day, these levels were twice as high as the day after Diwali in 2015, crossing 650 µg/m³, 26 times above the WHO’s guideline levels, or levels considered safe. On the morning of November 1, 2016, citizens in Delhi woke up to an average PM 2.5 level of over 700 µg/m³–some of the highest levels recorded the world over and 29 times above WHO standards./The WHO guideline for 24-hour average PM 2.5 levels is 25 µg/m³. With an annual average PM 2.5 level of 122 µg/m³, Delhi’s air is the worst among global megacities with dense populations, as IndiaSpend reported in October 2016 based on WHO data./The CPCB sensors were located within a 5-km radius of our #Breathe. We observed that for the week ending October 30, 2016, PM 2.5 levels recorded by the CPCB monitors were lower than those recorded by #Breathe sensors in many instances. This variance could be attributed to the difference in location and other local climatic factors. However, the trends of variation in PM 2.5 levels over the week are similar, as the graph below indicates./Away from the national capital region, Patna recorded a 24-hour average PM 2.5 level of 437.3 µg/m³– nearly 95% higher than the levels recorded last year (224.9 µg/m³) and 17 times above WHO guideline levels. In Varanasi, while Diwali day itself recorded a 40% higher average of PM 2.5 at 247.1 µg/m³, the next day’s levels continued to soar to an average of 578.6 µg/m³, 23 times above WHO guideline levels. Agra recorded rising pollution levels progressively up to the morning of November 1, 2016, more than double the values recorded last year. Lucknow recorded a 37% increase in PM 2.5 levels in 2016 over 2015./Air before Diwali 2016 was cleaner than in 2015, then it deteriorated, swiftly/The escalation in pollution levels this year was swifter and sharper, according to our analysis./On October 23, 2016–one week before Diwali–Varanasi recorded a 24-hour average PM 2.5 level of 96 µg/m³, nearly half the level recorded last year. Similarly, average pollution levels in Agra and the Delhi were 38% and 30% lower, respectively, than those recorded on the corresponding day in 2015 (November 4, 2015). Lucknow was 11% less polluted this year, while only Patna recorded 38% higher levels, compared to November 4, 2015./Lower wind speeds and a shorter vertical mixing layer–the height at which air turbulence can disperse pollutants–caused particulate matter to remain trapped near the surface level, according to the CPCB. With the festival arriving earlier this year, the recorded mean wind speed was 61% lower. Last year, Diwali night also registered a mean mixing height twice as high./“The level of pollutants has increased significantly in all places irrespective of parameters attributed to unfavorable meteorological conditions during the entire period,” the CPCB said in this report./By Alison Saldanha & Karthik Madhavapeddi/(By IndiaSpend.org, a data-driven, non-profit and public interest journalism platform with whom Alison Saldanha is an assistant editor and Karthik Madhavapeddi is a desk editor.)/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Delhi chokes on worst Nov smog in many years,"NEW DELHI: Delhiites woke up to apocalyptic grey skies as a heavy smog hung over the city on Wednesday, reducing visibility to its lowest for the month of November in many years. The air quality was so poor that it was comparable to the post-Di wali spike in pollution. The air quality index for 4pm on November 2 was 432, in the ""severe"" category, while the index on October 31 (the day after Diwali) was 445.The Met office said visibility at the IGI Airport was in the range of 300-500m -on a par with dense-fog days in December and January which was the worst the city has witnessed in November in many years. /An official said Wednesday's visibility was poorer than in November 2012, when the city had the worst smog (for the month) in recent years.The smog thickened by nightfall and at 9pm, visibility at IGI had dropped to 250m. Experts called for an ""emgency response"" as the air ergency response"" as the air quality has been in ""severe"" or ""very poor"" levels for more than a week now. On Wednesday , PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) concentrations peaked to ""dangerous"" levels in the morning. PM 2.5 levels crossed highs of more than 700 micrograms per cubic metres at various lo cations such as R K Puram, Punjabi Bagh and Anand Vihar on Wednesday morning after 7.30 am. The PM 10 (coarse pollution particles) levels peaked to 1,600 micrograms per cubic metres at these locations and remained higher than 1,000 micrograms per cubic metres for most of the day.Scientists at air quality monitoring agencies said the very high levels of pollution were due to the cumulative impact of crop residue burning in neighbouring states and pollutants emitted on Diwali. ""Look at the largescale crop stubble burning in Punjab. NASA images show smoke has spread all over the region. The pollutants cannot disperse because of the calm conditions,"" said a scientist from DPCC.""The crop fires have been going on for weeks now. Also, the firecrackers burst on Diwali are still hanging in the air. There is no immediate intervention to address this. We need the government to take emergency action now. How else will the levels come down?"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury from the Centre for Science and Environment.Some scientists in pollution monitoring agencies even suggested that primary schools should be closed so that children are not exposed to such high pollution levels.In Beijing, as part of their four-tier pollution alarm system, this kind of severe air pollution on three consecutive days would result in a ""red alert"", where schools and kindergartens are closed, power plants directed to cut emissions, car use regulated according to number plates (restrictions similar to odd-even). SAFAR under MoES on its website said when firecracker emissions were about to dissipate, wind direction on November 1 evening became north-westerly for a few hours before settling down to north-easterly./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"50,000 old vehicles still in Gurgaon despite NGT ban as officials struggle to contain pollution","GURGAON: Four days after the post-Diwali haze, Gurgaon's air pollution may have reduced but the air is still far from breathable. Sadly, despite Gurgaon having to deal with a thicker smog than neighbouring Delhi, one can still spot polluting vehicles on its roads. In fact, many of these vehicles have been flouting norms, being well past their age limits.According to National Green Tribunal (NGT) orders, petrol vehicles older than 15 years and diesel vehicles older than 10 years (as on February 29, 2016) should not be allowed to ply in the NCR. /The deadline to de-register old vehicles from Gurgaon RTA was set for October 31. On Friday, it was extended to November 15. This applies to vehicles registered under series HR55, HR55A, HR55B, HR55C, HR55D.Afterwards, no objection certificates were issued by the RTA to 8,000 vehicles with All India Tourist Permits, so that they could be registered outside NCR. That still leaves at least 50,000 vehicles in Gurgaon which need to be phased out, revealed sources in the RTA. The process of cancelling registration of these vehicles will start from November 16. Most of these are autos, private cabs and goods carriers. Regular checks are being carried out on trucks, buses and other heavy vehicles by the RTA. In fact, over 400 buses have been impounded and challaned by the officials this year. Due to this, transporters no longer send older heavy vehicles out on NCR routes. As a result, public transport is a headache for authorities and increasingly becoming a health hazard for residents due to the harmful fumes they emit.In Gurgaon, around 10,000 diesel cabs have exceeded their age limit set by NGT. In addition, there are over 15,000 diesel-run shared autos, which can be seen on the roads emitting thick black smoke while ferrying passengers. However, there is no clampdown on them yet. The deadline is over, but RTA officials are still preparing a list of vehicles that are older than the NGT age limit. A senior RTA official told TOI ""this list will be completed only by early next week, when it will be submitted to NGT"".Unfortunately, so far traffic police is challaning and impounding vehicles only during enforcement drives. Sources revealed a comprehensive programme, that includes challaning, impounding and notifying RTA, needs Authority approval to be carried out by police. After de-registration, the RTA is to issue a public notice and supply a list of such vehicles to traffic cops, who will then take appropriate steps as per NGT directions. ""Once we get the information from the RTA, we'll take all necessary steps as per law,"" said joint commissioner of police, Y Puran Kumar.But with officials busy in paperwork, residents continue to breathe poison.Experts believe while Diwali crackers are burst once a year and stubble burning is carried out periodically, vehicular emission is a 24x7 year-round issue. ""The diesel smoke include respirable particles which gets into the lungs. They are carcinogenic and cause deadly diseases. So we can't ignore the threat,"" said environmentalist Niranjan Raje./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

There was no wind in the vertical column and this situation is expected to persist for a few more days, a statement by CSE said.Central Pollution Control Board's air quality index for 24 hours was 432, the same as Wednesday . Values above 400 mean air pollution is severe.PM2.5 peaked to 10 to 11 times the 24-hour safe standard at locations such as RK Puram, Punjabi Bagh and Anand Vihar. ""This is one of the worst smog episodes. It's mainly because a change in wind pattern coincided with Diwali. The aerosols from crackers and other burnt material couldn't escape,"" said Vishen.R K Jenamani, head of IGI Met office, couldn't be reached for comment on CSE's visibility findings.CSE also found that the post-Diwali pollution peak on Wednesday was worse than the pollution peak on Diwali. An analysis of data from Delhi Pollution Control Committee showed PM2.5 levels increased by 62.7% on November 2 as compared to Diwali. On November 1(12am to 6am on Nov 2), the PM2.5 concentrations were about 548 micrograms per cubic metres -nine times the safe standard. On November 2 (6am to noon), PM 2.5 concentrations increased to 696 micrograms per cubic metres-11.6 times the safe standard.These alarming numbers can only be brought down with emergency measures, CSE experts said.""Immediately step up action and put out hard health evidences and heath alerts in the public domain to sensitise the public about the harmful effects of smog and push action.

Planting hope of clean air,"NEW DELHI: Delhi's severe air quality is a cause for concern. Globally, bad air has been confirmed as a leading cause of heart diseases, and the World Health Organization attributes more than 6 lakh deaths nationally to foul air every year. While countering this bane requires addressing every source of emission in and outside the city, we plan to develop city forests inthe capital that can help sequester air pollutants in future years.Along with Hero MotoCorp and Delhi Development Authority (DDA), TOI will undertake plantations at Tughlaqabad Biodiversity Park, Tilpat valley and Neela Hauz.TOI ran a month-long plantation campaign called the TOI Green Drive with Hero MotoCorp and DDA in August last year when more than a lakh saplings were planted in Tilpat Valley Biodiversity Park near the Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary and in other areas such as Bakoli village, Sidhola village, Vishal Bagh to Ghoga crossing, Sector 28 Rohini, Sector 28-II also in Rohini in north Delhi and at Sanjay Lake, Sector 16, Dwarka and District Park Kalkaji in south Delhi.The Hero TOI Green Drive will take place at Tughlaqabad Biodiversity Park on November 5, Tilpat valley on November 6 and Neela Hauz on November 11. ""The plantation drive will be similar to what we did last year at Tilpat valley, with only native Aravali species being planted to recreate the original biodiversity of this region. /About 10,000 saplings will be planted at Neela Hauz and 30,000 in Tughlaqabad,"" said CR Babu, professor emeritus, DU, and head of the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE), which is executing the biodiversity park projects for DDA.The idea is to improve the city's green cover to help address air pollution, bring back birds and animals that have disappeared from the city, improve and revive native biodiversity in a highly degraded area like the Tilpat valley, which is a part of Delhi Ridge, and counter the urban heat island effects where certain areas record higher temperature than other parts due to excessive concretisation. More than 40,000 people turned up at Tilpat valley on August 30 to plant over 1 lakh saplings. Volunteers from 40 NGOs under the Teach India programme, 2,800 NIE school students and 16 spiritual organisations representing all religions participated.Tilpat valley is already on its way to recovery now. A carpet of native grass now covers the land. More than 85% of the saplings planted not only survived, but have grown to a height of 1-3 metres. The plantation drive at Tilpat valley was planned meticulously to replicate native forests of the Aravali.The biodiversity park will start providing ecological benefits to the city in 10 years when the canopy height reaches around 25 feet./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
ToxiCity: Gurgaon air more foul than Delhi,"The air you breathed in Gurgaon on Thursday was the foulest in the country as an overcast sky and absence of strong winds ensured thick smog continued to hang over the city./Gurgaon's AQI was at a 'severe' 454, higher than Delhi (432) and Faridabad (427), which were the country's three most polluted cities on Thursday, data released by the Central Pollution Control Board on Thursday showed. Another set of data released by Safar, though, showed Delhi's AQI on Thursday at 500+. Safar, however, does not measure Gurgaon data./The average concentration of fine particulate matter -PM2.5 -was 697 micrograms per cubic metre (gm3), almost a 70% rise from Wednesday's level of 423.

Respiratory infection cases shoot up in Agra after Diwali,"AGRA: In the days following Diwali, the city has been witnessing an exponential rise in the numbers of patients suffering from chest infection, asthma and tuberculosis turning up at city hospitals. According to doctors, there has been an increase of 40-45% in the number of such cases in the past five days, compared to normal days./The rise in the number of cases has been registered at SN Medical College (SNMC) and the district hospital here. While SNMC noted a rise of nearly 50%, district hospital officials found a rise of 10-20% so far./Medical experts have attributed the problem to firecrackers burst during Diwali and the smog that enveloped NCR in the days following the festival. Experts suggested that to avoid air pollution-related infections, city residents should avoid direct exposure to the outdoors for long period and use good quality respiratory masks or handkerchiefs./“TB, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cases have gone up in the past five days due to increase in air pollution level in the city,” said Dr Santosh Kumar, head of the TB ward at SNMC./“There has been a 70-80% rise in the number of TB patients being registered at the ward here, which is an enormous rise in comparison to normal days,” Kumar added, but said that as the days pass, the rise in number of cases will decline./The specialist suggested that citizens should avoid direct exposure to the outdoors for long hours and avoid morning and evening walks, as pollution levels are highest during the morning and evening because of thermal inversion and smog formation./“Do not carry out strenuous exercises in the open or non-treated exercise areas like gyms and ask your children not to play outdoors or limit their sports activities to the indoors,” Kumar suggested, adding that people eat jiggery to detoxify and also increase intake of citrus fruits./Dr Gajendra Vikram Singh, assistant professor at the department of TB and chest at SNMC, said that due to smog coming from Delhi NCR, chest and bronchial complaints had increased./“Fever, cough and chest infections are common symptoms due to increased air pollution in the city,” he said, adding that the presence of fine particles 2-5 microns in size has aggravated the situation, particularly among those who have asthma, COPD or TB./He also suggested that fine particles were the product of crop burning by farmers around NCR./“Farmers must stop burning crop residue and find another way of disposing it, as the practice is very harmful to the environment and public health,” Singh added./Dr Suvir Gupta, senior city-based cardiologist said that after Diwali the risk of heart-related disease had also gone up, mainly due to consumption of oily foods and sweets as well as changes in sleeping patterns./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Do the people have the right to breathe fresh air?

The environment ministry will step in to review it every quarter./The National Green Tribunal, meanwhile, on Friday slammed the Delhi government for its lacklustre response towards tackling air pollution. “Have you done anything to prevent children from going to school, did you give advisory to public?” the tribunal observed./“The people have the right to breathe fresh air,” it said while reprimanding the Kejriwal government./The tribunal also summoned the environment secretaries of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Rajasthan over the increase in pollution in the region and asked them to submit a report on burning of agricultural residues and measures taken to curb pollution by November 8. The environment ministry, meanwhile, has outlined an immediate course of action:/STUBBLE CHECK/One of the key causes of air pollution in Delhi — smoke from crop burning in neighbouring states — still stays unaddressed. Environment ministry sources said there has been considerable crop burning in Punjab from last week of October right through the first week of November, pushing up pollution levels in Delhi-NCR. At the meeting presided over by Environment Minister Anil Dave, Punjab has assured that crop burning will be checked./Governments of Punjab and Haryana have been advised to set up biomass power plants in large numbers and it was agreed at the meeting that states should ask major industries to use CSR funds to control stubble burning and procure farm machinery like happy seeders, rotavators, straw choppers etc./Environmental clearance could also be linked to commitments towards utilising CSR funds to control stubble burning./The Delhi government was also asked on Friday to examine the possibility of providing funds from the Environment Compensation Charge and diesel cess to the neighbouring states for incentivising various machinery like happy seeders, rotavators, straw choppers, gyro rakes, bailers, mulchers etc to minimise straw burning by farmers./NO SMOKING/CPCB will develop an app immediately to report burning of garbage/biomass/dry leaves, including landfill fire. All state agencies and enforcement officers will be linked to the app./The Delhi government has been asked to take a slew of decisions with immediate effect. The Kejriwal government will soon write to the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) to ensure that transportation of fly ash around Delhi — mainly from the Badarpur Thermal plant — is done in an environment-friendly manner./There will also be a review of the pollution under control (PUC) checkpoints in Delhi to check vehicular pollution and the traffic police will be asked to ensure lane discipline, check against overloaded vehicles, visibly polluting vehicles and vehicles parked in nondesignated areas./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
That choking feeling when you step out,"Noida/Ghaziabad: It was difficult to breathe outdoors in Ghaziabad and Noida on Saturday as the smoke-haze triggered by crop burning in Punjab and Haryana drove up pollution levels in the NCR cities to a choking high. ""My eyes burnt the moment I stepped out. I tried walking across quickly to a nearby mall but began breathing heavily because of the smog,"" said a 34-year-old woman, a communications professional, standing outside Jaipuria Mall in Indirapuram. /""This is the worst I have felt since this phase began the day after Diwali,"" she added. The particulate matter (PM) 2.5 index in Noida remained in the 'severe' range, at an offscale 500+, during the day, according to data from Safar (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research). In Anand Vihar on the Ghaziabad border, the US embassy's monitoring station showed the PM 2.5 level at an extreme high of 999 microgram per cubic metre. That explained the choking feeling throughout the day in neighbouring Vaishali, Indirapuram and Kaushambi.Many morning walkers and office-goers were seen wearing masks even as the smog and dust created breathing problems for others. ""What we are inhaling these days is nothing but toxic air. We are not safe either in our house or in the car,"" said Rajiv Tandon, who lives in Sector 49, Noida. ""This can be gauged from the recurring cold many residents are having these days. I have breathing problems and a burning sensation in my eyes for the past few days, especially since Diwali,"" he added. District magistrate N P Singh told TOI though there's no advisory for schools to remain shut, they have been asked to stop all outdoor activities given the poor air quality in the city. ""The reason for not closing schools also comes from the fact that many working parents don't have an option to leave the child behind. This is the feedback received from schools and principals,"" said Singh. Ghaziabad DM Nidhi Kesharwani too said that there was no advisory to shut schools.D K Maurya, president of the Federation of Apartment Owners Association in Ghaziabad, added, ""There was a severe burning sensation in the eye when we moved outdoors. Housing societies have advised elderly residents and kids to remain indoors as much as possible."" The Noida RWA federation, meanwhile, wrote to the CEO and DCEO of the Noida Authority over increasing pollution levels. ""The dust is mostly due to various construction work such as Metro, elevated roads, underpasses, U-turns as well as builder construction sites,"" said N P Singh, president, Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations. The RWA body has also demanded that all construction sites be watered on a regular basis to curb dust pollution.According to senior residents, the situation has become worse due to lack of planning. ""Noida has been converted from a farming sprawl to a concrete jungle over the years. As a result, one sees the absence of vegetation on roadsides, considered essential to control dust as well as harvest rainwater,"" said Anil Kumar, an early settler of Sector 56.Noida-based environmentalist Deepak Jain said unchecked construction wasn't helping air pollution, though farm fires were the trigger for the current spell of haze. ""Most green belts are encroached, unkempt or concretised,"" said Jain./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

""There is an emergency situation in Delhi. The situation is bad, particularly for children, patients, women and the elderly. We need to take immediate steps to deal with the situation,"" Dave told reporters, adding he was also exploring the possibility to call a meeting of chief ministers of all these states on the issue.LG Najeeb Jung has also called a high-level meeting on Monday to take stock of the immediate, short-term and long term measures. Those invited to the meeting include the CM, health minister Satyendar Jain, environment minister Imran Hussain, the Delhi chief secretary as well as representatives of the police and the civic bodies.Dave said the situation had been ""very alarming"" and that there was a need to take short-term measures to deal with the situation immediately, adding he discussed with Kejriwal some ""emergency measures"", including ways to contain dust pollution and crop burning.""There are five reasons triggering air pollution that include use of firewood, coal, diesel, petrol and burning of agricultural waste. We have to find a solution to the problem We should imbibe self discipline in our routine lifestyle. If I don't minimise use of my four cars and expect other people to use cycles, that should not be happen. We should collectively come under self-regulation,"" he said.Both Dave and Kejriwal were in agreement that shutting down schools was not the solution. Kejriwal pitched for providing alternatives and incentives to farmers so that they discard the traditional practice of burning farm stubbles. ""There is no one particular reason behind alarming air pollution in Delhi. We need to collectively address all issues and improve air quality. We should not indulge in political blame game,"" Dave added.Earlier at a press conference at his residence, Kejriwal said that pollution had increased to an extent that outdoors in Delhi were resembling a gas chamber. ""Prima facie the biggest reason seems to be burning of stubble in agricultural fields in Haryana and Punjab in huge quantity,"" he said. The CM added vehicle restriction measures like the odd-even scheme would not be able to bring down the smog as initial studies suggest that the influx of pollutant-laden smoke from Punjab and Haryana had aggravated the situation. ""The Centre can sit with the CMs of these states and chalk out a solution. A few reports have put the volume of stubble being burned at 6-20 million tonnes. Fireworks during Diwali marginally added to the pollution./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Day-long smoke haze leaves Delhi gasping for breath,"Delhi got an apocalyptic vision on Saturday of what its future could be like if pollution controlling measures are not implemented urgently. The city experienced a very alarming air pollution episode as pollution levels shot off the charts. A grey shroud enveloped the city through the day and evening with people complaining of irritable eyes, inflammation of throat and nose and a feeling of running out of fresh air -some even within their homes.The 24-hour air quality index (AQI) was at ""severe"" with an index value of 485, worst for the season and higher than the post-Diwali AQI of 445. Meteorology and Central Pollution Control Board officials described it as ""smoke haze"" and not ""smog."" /That, however, was little consolation to people. The day passed without the Delhi government or the Centre announcing any emergency measures though the two remained engaged with the issue.The lieutenant governor called a high-level meeting to discuss the situation with the chief minister and the ministers of the departments concerned. Delhi has recorded a ""severe"" AQI with just two ""very poor"" days in between since Diwali on October 30.On Saturday , Anand Vihar's AQI remained 500 constantly for several hours, possibly be cause an AQI above 500 is not even charted. Any concentration above 250 micrograms per cubic metres is graded as ""severe"" whereas concentrations at most locations monitored by DPCC and CPCB remained above 500 micrograms per cubic metres all through the day , shooting up to 700 to 850 micrograms per cubic metres often.""I have lived in Delhi since 1991 and never seen anything like this before. This is of a different proportion altogether,"" said an environment department scientist./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Why we have failed to tackle air pollution: 5 reasons,"NEW DELHI: Neither the Centre nor the states have put in place a plan to tackle rising pollution in cities across India. Here are five reasons why we have failed to tackle the pollution menace.1. We are not monitoring air quality in real time: 573 places still monitor air quality manually The Central Pollution Control Board gets real-time air quality data from only two or three monitoring stations in most cities. This gives a skewed picture of air quality status and compromises policy-making. /Most cities depend on manual monitoring stations, which use obsolete technology, and data is released just twice a week.2. We don't know the sources of air pollution: 2008 was when data on pollution sources was last collected in citiesA study by IIT Kanpur for Delhi revealed that the contribution of each source of pollution-vehicles, waste burning, construction dust-changes with the seasons, but most cities don't have this information. Bengaluru's emissions inventory was conducted in 2010 and Chennai's by IIT Madras in 2011, while Kanpur, Mumbai and Pune released their reports in 2010.3. Governments fail to enforce: 94 cities don't meet national air quality standards, says CPCBBut no city administration seems worried about getting off that list. Delhi, for instance, is still short of 5,000 buses; it hasn't implemented SC directions on prohibiting waste burning or ensuring construction projects don't pollute. Data for most cities makes it obvious that air pollution is not high on any government's priority list.4. Ignoring health risks: 8.5% of GDP - Welfare costs and lost labour income due to air pollution in 2013 as per World Bank reportWhile air pollution is hurting the country's exchequer, it's also associated with certain cancers, lower birth weight, premature birth, strokes and respiratory disease. Across the country, air pollution is linked to 6.7 lakh premature deaths.5: People aren't pitching inThe Deonar landfill fire drew attention to Mumbai's waste problem, while Delhi's three landfills are constantly on fire exposing lakhs of people to carcinogenic emissions. This is a common problem in all cities. If people segregated garbage at home, there would be no burning of waste. People can also choose public transport, or pick electric and CNG vehicles./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pollution protesters outline clear strategy to lift haze,"GURUGRAM: Wearing masks on a Saturday morning that looked more like dusk, 300 citizens hit the roads of Gurgaon to protest against general indifference to the causes of pollution and create awareness against waste burning. The protesters said they wanted the government as well as people to take ownership of the cause to clean up the air for themselves as well as the generations to come. Among the protesters were CEOs, housewives, doctors, students and retired government officers, all marching together as a thick smoke-haze threw a grey cloak over the city and the air quality index went back to the 'severe' 400+ level. /Calling their motley group 'People Against Air Pollution', they gathered at Leisure Valley Park at 10am to start the march.

Air pollution touches alarming level in Rajasthan,"JAIPUR: Sriganganagar, Kota and Bundi districts have the highest density of air pollutants in the state as per the latest satellite data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in Delhi at a meeting with state pollution control boards on Friday.According to Rajasthan Pollution Control Board (RPCB) officials, the burning of crops in Punjab and Sriganganagar district has made the situation alarming in northern Rajasthan. In fact, the air quality has touched to the scale of 'alarming.' This means it's dangerous for those having breathing problems.""The thick layer of smog is likely to continue in the northern districts till the situation turns normal in Delhi and Punjab. /The burning of crops is banned in Rajasthan. There's need to take firm action elsewhere as the smoke spreads to other areas in the state,"" said a RPCB official requesting anonymity.The impact of Punjab is evident on the air quality of Jodhpur which shows 360 on the air quality index (AQI). An AQI of 100 is considered normal.After Diwali, the air quality in Jaipur has registered a pollution level of 235. This is considered 'poor' as per the air quality index and 2.5 times worse than the normal.Officials claimed that in a day or two the situation would be brought under control and Jaipur would have moderate or good air quality.The air quality in Kota and Bundi has gone for a toss due to the smoke emitted by industrial units. In fact, Kota along with Jaipur, Alwar and Jodhpur comes in the top 100 polluted cities in the country. Rising vehicular density has further aggravated the situation in these districts.""We have been raising this issue for long.

"'Smog is killing us, but do we have an option?'","NEW DELHI: Fear and uncertainty hang heavy in the air in Bhalswa JJ colony where Anirudh Kumar Pandey's family is celebrating Chhath. A thick layer of smog has enveloped the locality close to which a mountain of waste keeps catching fire due to methane emissions. The smoke emanating from this 40-acre landfill has left many people with lung disorders and caused other health problems.Everybody in Bhalswa is breathing in tiny particles. /Residents often complain of a burning sensation in their eyes. The smog rarely fades away . Sustained exposure to the smog is not safe, but the devotees hardly have any option.""This is the worst episode of smog in the recent years. The sun is rarely visible in the afternoon,"" said Ram Pyare Singh, another resident. Health minister Satyen dar Jain on Saturday visited the landfill site and said it's one of the major contributors to air pollution in the national capital. ""Inspected Bhalswa dumping site to tackle pollution menace,"" Jain later tweeted.Over three lakh people of this colony will celebrate Chhath. They live close to the site where nearly 2,700 tonnes of garbage being generated from south and the north Delhi areas are dumped on a daily basis.""The festival of Chhath is known for purity of offerings and environment. But this year, it will be celebrated in the dirtiest atmosphere,"" said Jitendra Dubey, founder of a Chhath Puja committee. People from Burari also perform the puja at Bhalswa lake.The waterbody draws people from across NCR. Even some people from Panipat also visit this lake during this time of the year. Thousands of devotees spend the night in tents after offering prayers to the sun-god. A resident said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was a regular visitor during Chhath. Over 100 families of bureaucrats will join the celebrations as well. Dubey said it was in 1988 hen migrants from Bihar when migrants from Bihar first celebrated Chhath in Bhalswa.

""The demand for air purifiers has increased in the last three days especially in the last two days. We have sold more than 15 pieces today itself and almost a dozen of them have been booked in advance as well,"" said Dheeraj, a salesman. /The demand for purifiers has increased more particularly due to smaller kids and senior citizens, who are the worst hit in this air pollution crisis.

Winter may get people coughing, but it's in summer that the air is dirtier. Vehicular emissions, road dust and construction activity (including eight years of work on the Chennai Metro Rail) are major air pollutants.

Every year, pollution peaks after the festival, though the worst months are December and January . The administration has been taking sporadic steps to check pollution. For instance, use of adulterated fuel by autorickshaws, a major source of pollution, was banned. Automatic pollution recording stations have been set up, but monitoring and implementation of norms remain lax.Automatic recording stations often do not work. The three major causes of pollution are vehicle emission, construction dust and industrial emission. Over the last five years, a number of industrial units have been forced to move out of Kolkata or adopt less-polluting methods. Many have switched from coal to LPG. Pollution from construction dust remains a threat since Kolkata is expanding fast and construction activity is on the rise. --Prithvijit Mitra/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Delhi-like dense smog, haze envelop Lucknow, create scare","LUCKNOW: Since 2011, at least 94 Indian cities have not met national air quality standards. Many of these cities have been on the list from 1990s, say CPCB officials.Neither the Centre nor the states have put in place a plan to ensure that cities get taken off this list. For the past couple of years when air pollution in Delhi, Kanpur, Lucknow and Varanasi touched dangerous levels, the CPCB did nothing to ensure that its directions on meeting air quality standards were enforced. /Lucknowites had a feel of Delhi on Sunday as a sheet of dense smog enveloped the city and air pollution levels rose alarmingly-three to four times of the pollution witnessed on normal days and six to eight times of the permissible limits. The smog, which created a scare among people, is likely to remain till Tuesday .State Met director JP Gupta said the smog was formed by accumulation of pollutants in the air during this part of the year when temperatures are below normal, wind speed is low and moisture content is high. ""The moisture content is high because easterly winds are dominating the atmosphere. The pollutants combine with tiny water droplets to form smog,"" he said. In dry weather, pollutants settle down or are blown away.The easterly winds had also led to clouding on Saturday, which caused drop in maximum and minimum temperatures. People woke up to haze on Sunday and as the day passed, the smog got thicker with addition of pollutants.Monitoring by the Indian Institute of Toxicology and Research (IITR) showed that PM2.5 and PM10 concentration in the air was around 400 micrograms and 800 micrograms respectively between 11am and 3pm, almost on a par with the pollution that made the city gasp on Diwali day.In comparison, Delhi on Sunday recorded PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations around 672 and 864 respectively.The permissible limits as per the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for PM2.5 and and PM10 are 60 and 100 micrograms respectively . On normal days, PM2.5 and PM10 concentration in Lucknow is around 110 and 216 micrograms respectively .PM are fine particulate matter suspended in the air.They are hazardous for health and also reduce visibility in the air.""Not only the concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 was high, level of the extremely fine particulate matter PM1 (of diameter less than 1 micron) was recorded to be 145 micrograms per cubic metre of air,"" said IITR senior scientist S C Barman./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Gurgaon's 'pet peeves' on bad air days,"GURGAON: Rising pollution levels in Gurgaon are not only causing distress to people but also to man's best friend. Cooper, a Labrador in Sector 45, is finding it hard to breathe outdoors. ""I have noticed that Cooper wants to go out in the morning (as per his routine), but faces discomfort in breathing. /After I consulted a veterinary doctor, he told me that many such cases are coming to him and it is due to increase in the level of air pollution,"" said Reema Sen, Cooper's parent. According to veterinary doctors, nearly 15% increase has been witnessed in cases of coughing, wheezing and chest congestion among dogs post Diwali. ""While many cases, especially among stray dogs go unreported, we have witnessed an increase of around 15% in cases of coughing and wheezing. The only way to protect our pets is to keep them indoors. Dogs have smaller respiratory system and thus they are more vulnerable to respiratory diseases caused by air pollution,"" said Dr Shally Mattoo Jalali, director, SJ's Pet Care.Expressing his concerns over cases of tremors among dogs, Dr Jalali said, ""Shockingly, many people have reported tremors, especially among stray dogs. It indicates that the nervous system of dogs might have been affected by inhaling polluted air. "" ""Even though most vets (even me) are suggesting people to keep their pets indoors, pause in their routine activities can bring behavioural changes. It can cause stress which may lead to reduced reproduction and cardiovascular diseases,"" said Dr Sumit Dhankar, a city-based veterinarian.

"Schools shut, construction work stopped in smoke house Delhi","NEW DELHI: As the capital continued to suffer one of its worst spells of air pollution in living memory and air quality further dipped to the season's lowest on Sunday, the Delhi government finally announced a slew of emergency measures to deal with the public health crisis.All schools have been shut for three days and construction and demolition activities across the city banned for five days, starting Monday.The government has imposed a five-day ban on operation of diesel generator sets, except for 'emergency' services such as hospitals, mobile towers etc.The government was also looking at fanciful options like the possibility of creating artificial rain while preparing for another round of odd-even traffic restrictions.""We are not pointing fingers at anyone but crop burning is a problem that we all have to tackle together. Delhi's problem is that base level pollution here was already quite high and the pollution from crop burning has made things worse. We have consulted experts and have drawn up a list of emergency measures. /People should avoid going outdoors as much as possible for the time being,"" chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday. As dust is a major pollutant, the government has prohibited construction and demolition activity in the city for five days, including at Metro sites. So far, directions had been given on dust control measures but that having failed, it has been decided to suspend all activity. PWD has been directed to water all its roads to try and settle the dust at these stretches, and start vacuum cleaning of all roads 100 feet and wider from November 10.PWD started hosing its roads from Sunday while teams have been deployed to remove construction and demolition waste from roadsides./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
What worked for Beijing might not here,"New Delhi: With public pressure mounting, the Delhi government seemed desperate to find an immediate solution to the severe air pollution problem. On Sunday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had suggested cloud seeding as an emergency measure; on Monday, Delhi environment minister Imran Hussain urged Union environment minister Anil Madhav Dave to ""bring artificial rain technology like other countries do"". But cloud seeding may not be as simple as it appears. In fact, it may not work at all in the prevalent weather condition in Delhi. /""You need more moisture to do cloud seeding. I think it's an impractical idea because cloud seeding may not be possible in such a large area. The mog may return in a day or two because emissions will continue. Plus, there will be additional emissions from the aircraft used,"" said professor Manju Mohan of Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT Delhi. Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, has a cloud seeding and weather modification programme, and scientists from there have been testing physical problem of aerosol particles all over Delhi. ""Moisture can be a tricky issue in Delhi. The relative humidity should be between 80% and 90%, but that alone is not enough. We need to understand what the pollution particles in Delhi are like. What are their chemical and physical properties? These particles may not be able to form rain drops like clouds do,"" said a scientist. He added that even if pollutants are washed out, relief would be short-term as emission would continue. The nature of pollutants would also determine the environmental impact of rains that wash down these. ""Acid rain is not common any more, but we need to study what are these pollutants,"" he added.The total cost of one such cloud-seeding exercise could range between Rs 10 crore and Rs 12 crore, including the cost of hiring aircraft, radar technology and other instruments. National Green Tribunal on Monday directed the Delhi government to check the possibility of spraying water from helicopters to keep the dust and smoke down. Cloud seeding found no mention. China uses a wide range of technologies and has a budget of nearly $2 trillion to assist what premier Li Keqiang describes as ""war on pollution"". These include technologies to clean coal, artificial rain etc. The government has allocated $800 billion for cleaning the air by 2018 and managed to attract interest from joint ventures offering a total of $920 billion./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
SC panel sounds alarm even as haze lifts,"NEW DELHI: After a weekend which many spent gasping for breath and queuing up at pharmacies for masks - making the government declare several emergency measures to deal with air pollution-there was a slight relief on Monday. The PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) levels started falling as wind speed picked up. But Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB's) 24-hour air quality index (4pm, Nov 6 to 4 pm, Nov 7) continued to be in the ""severe"" category with a value of 423.Met officials said the change came about due to prevalence of westerly and north-westerly winds that helped to disperse the pollutants that had been accumulating over Delhi for the past few days. /""The anti-cyclone that established over Delhi around October 28 has finally weakened and the typical climatological system for this time has set in. The wind picked up during the day and broke the inversion layer of the past three days that was not allowing pollutants to disperse. Visibility also improved significantly with Safdarjung recording a 1.8-km visibility in the afternoon. We will see an improvement in conditions over the next two to three days,"" said a scientist of Delhi's regional meteorological centre.System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), under the ministry of earth sciences, also continued to indicated ""severe"" pollution with a PM 2.5 running average value of 622 micrograms per cubic metres. But the increase in wind speed made most people sigh with relief as it not only improved visibility, but also reduced symptoms like burning of eyes and inflammation of throat and nose.From zero and even a negative value that was being recorded over the weekend, the wind speed on Monday improved to 1.5 to 2 metres per second but started falling again after 7 pm. CPCB scientists said the average wind speed was 0.9 metres per second on Saturday, 0.6 metres on Sunday and 1.1 metres on Monday. The PM average 2.5 concentrations recorded at CPCB stations were 582 micrograms per cubic metres on Saturday which is 9.7 times the national safe standard, 709 micrograms per cubic metres on Sunday, 1.7 times the safe standard, and 423 micrograms per cubic metres on Monday, about seven times the standard.A SAFAR scientist said the wind speed was virtually nil and the wind direction was north-westerly until now but that is changing to north-easterly. ""The boundary layer was as low as 50 metres yesterday. Now it's between 50 and 100 metres. The wind speed is likely to increase due to change in the wind direction but in the next few days the temperature will decrease.

The traffic police will be on high alert and government hospitals would also be functional during night to deal with any emergency. The deputy commissioners in affected districts have been empowered to take decision at their own level to declare holidays in schools, depending upon the situation of air pollution in their respective areas.Khattar, who had threadbare discussion with senior officers on the issue of air pollution and measures to control it, directed them to ensure that guidelines issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) are followed in letter and spirit while undertaking construction activities. /He also directed the health department to issue an advisory to the people about different measures to protect themselves from smoke and pollution which included sprinkling of water in front of their houses and staying away from any work which emanates smoke.He said that with a view to prevent the reoccurrence of accidents on the national highways due to low visibility caused by the smog, the traffic police would be on high alert during the dark hours. All the government hospitals would also be on stand-by-mode to meet any eventuality and provide immediate medicare to the accident victims.The chief minister also ordered a high-level committee to be constituted comprising officers of agriculture, health, urban local bodies and Industry departments to explore the possibilities of setting up plants in the state for converting agriculture and urban waste into energy and submit the report within a month.He said that efforts were being made to permanently resolve the problem of air pollution due to burning of agricultural residue. Farmers in the state were being encouraged to use 'Happy Seader', a technique which is used for sowing wheat without burning of paddy residue. A subsidy of 50% is given on the purchase of this implement. The state government has also increased the budget for subsidy from Rs 21 crore to Rs 31 crore during the current financial year to cover larger number of farmers.The CM said straw-baler would be set up at each block in the next financial year to deal with the problem of burning of stubble. Following the directions issued by the CM, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has also issued directions to its all regional officers to ensure compliance on top priority and has sought their report on daily basis till November 12./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"CPCB report debunks state's pollution data on Diwali in Bhopal, its equal to Delhi","BHOPAL: Did Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) try to underplay noise and air pollution in Bhopal city on Diwali? If CPCB is to be believed, the answer is affirmative. Contrary to MPPCB data, a report by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) says level of Respiratory Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) recorded on Diwali at Nehru Nagar and Shahjanabad was almost as alarming as RK Puram and Punjabi Bagh in Delhi.MPPCB conveniently ignored Nehru Nagar, which recorded the highest particulate matter in Bhopal (PM 10 level is maximum) value of 1005\xB5g/m3 and Shahjanabad recorded 215 \xB5g/m3, and 194.3 \xB5g/m3 in Arera Colony.State PCB, without any delay, released the report saying air pollution was the lowest in the city as compared to last five years in Bhopal on Diwali driving home the point that green Diwali campaign was having a positive impact.On the other hand, CPCB says noise pollution level recorded at TT Nagar, Nehru Nagar & Shahjahanabad is 1.5 times more than the prescribed standards. CPCB had considered TT Nagar under the category of commercial area.PM10 average value is 697\xB5g/m3. The average is calculated few days before and after Diwali. /CPCB readings were collected from residential localities.Nehru Nagar has been marked under severe category. According to CPCB report, ""High level of pollution is going to have severe impact on health of even healthy human beings living in these areas. Diwali pollution created by bursting of excessive crackers in Nehru Nagar can result in serious respiratory diseases even on healthy people and serious health effect on people with lung/heart diseases.""Claiming the situation to be no different from residential areas of smog-hit New Delhi, environmentalist, Subhash C Pandey said, ""Air ambient quality and noise pollution in city areas have crossed all limits according to CPCB, whereas MPPCB is giving false hope to the residents that air quality is improving. How can a government body be so lenient in making such a serious report? They haven't even touched other important residential areas apart from Arera Colony in their report.""Moreover, if we talk about CPCB report, pollution-level in Bhopal on Diwali is extremely high, if they would have included, Hamidia road too in their report, Bhopal would have been among the severely polluted cities,"" he warned.Another residential area, Shahjanabad has recorded 215\xB5g/m3, which places it under under the category of moderate section.While MPPCB report suggests air pollution has come down, the areas mentioned in the report Arera Colony, Hamidia Road and Govindpura are still under category of poorly-affected areas, where the pollution can also cause breathing discomfort to people on prolonged exposure to pollution and discomfort to people with heart diseases, according to CPCB.On Diwali day, due to heavy bursting of crackers, noise pollution level in Bhopal recorded was 104.2 dB and also the average level value observed above the prescribed limit.""Vehicular movement, traffic jam, noisy crackers and playing of high pitch musical instruments during festival are the main sources attributed for the resultant increase in high noise level,"" says the CPCB report.According to P S Bundela, MPPCB, Regional officer, ""The pollution level varies from place to place.

Day curbs may flop as night air worse,"New Delhi: There is considerable variation in day time and night time PM 2.5 levels in the national capital with higher levels between dusk and dawn that reduces the efficacy of measures like odd-even, recent research has shown.Studying the impact of Diwali on air quality, the research carried out at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) showed the effect of the festival was not uniform throughout the day and was more prevalent at a particular time of the day than other times. ""The day of Diwali festival varies in the Gregorian calendar between October 17 and November 15 every year. Existing pollution levels are already high when compared to the annual average. /This is a confounding effect,"" the research by Dhananjay Ghei and Arjun Gupta revealed.An earlier work by the authors showed that there was variation in hourly pollution levels during different days of a week. ""We see that pollution levels are low during the day, but start increasing post 6pm and remain elevated till 9am of the next day,"" the paper said. ""The average PM 2.5 concentration from 6pm to 9am is 140 \xB5g/m3, whereas the average PM 2.5 concentration from 9am to 6pm is 108 \xB5g/m3. PM 2.5 levels in the range of 101-200 can cause breathing discomfort to anyone with prolonged exposure to the air during these times,"" it said. The NIPFP researchers said ""a measure that restricts traffic during the day such as the odd-even policy is unlikely to be as effective as a measure that restricts emissions at night"".The paper said the monsoon months have the lowest levels of PM 2.5 as larger particles settle in a few hours due to gravity, and smaller particles such as PM 2.5 are removed by precipitation. ""Winters have the highest levels of PM 2.5 in the air on account of low wind speed and high relative humidity. PM 2.5 concentration reaches above 200 in winters, which can cause respiratory illnesses to people on prolonged exposure and puts people with respiratory illness and heart disease on a far greater risk,"" it said.Elaborating on the location effect of pollution, the NIPFP research showed that Chanakyapuri seemed to perform better than other areas of Delhi in terms of PM 2.5.""Anand Vihar has the highest pollution levels amongst the five different locations, and has severe levels of air pollution in the night. This can cause respiratory impact even on healthy people, and serious health impacts on people with lung/heart diseases,"" it said.""Thus, we see that there is a strong location effect on pollution levels,"" the research showed./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air quality monitoring stations incapable of covering entire city,"The air quality monitoring equipment installed in five different locations across Nashik by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) are incapable of keeping a check on the entire city. This makes the situation a little worse as according to a recent finding, Nashik - with a population of around 18 lakh - was among the four cities that crossed the air pollution limit.The air quality monitoring stations are installed at Udyog Bhavan (MPCB's regional office), MIDC Satpur, Nashik Municipal Corporation building (East division) in Old Nashik, behind mayor's official residence and in KTHM College.""The air quality monitoring stations can record maximum up to a two-km radius from its installation point. The apparatus at KTHM College campus - Automated Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station - was installed recently under the Smart City project. /The MPCB has outsourced the monitoring work and we have only provided space. It gives data every 15 minutes. The average daily PM limit should be 100 microgram per meter cube but generally, we have it around 80 microgram per meter cube,"" said Dnyaneshwar Khandbahale of KTHM's environment department that monitors air quality.He added that throughout the day readings vary and generally winter mornings show higher reading due to fog. On Tuesday, air quality was 79 microgram per meter cube in the evening, 130 microgram per meter cube on October 28, on October 29 it was 149 microgram per meter cube at 9.45 am and on November 1 it was 146 microgram per meter cube in the morning.Agreeing that the number of air quality monitoring machines is insufficient, Khandbahale said, ""The machines were installed 10-12 years ago and since then the city has grown. There has been development on either side of the river. Hence, more number of machines is needed but this is a policy decision of the MPCB,"" he said.Environmentalist Rajesh Pandit said, ""The state transport buses emit a lot of black smoke and pollute the air. It is doubtful if they even have a PUC (pollution under control) certificate. There are around 7.5 lakh vehicles in the city as on March 31, which also add to the pollution to some extent.""An MPCB officer said that the air monitoring equipment were not sufficient to keep a check on the pollution and they would consider proposing more machines but that the city's air quality was still well under control./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Both authorities have been told to ""robustly"" check pollution-under-control certificates and ""take strictest action against violators"". Smoke meters will also be installed at all border points.The slew of measures come on the heels of similar directions from NGT. The transport department has already stopped re-registration of both petrol and diesel vehicles that are more than 15 years old for several months now. Monday's order will affect 79,803 private diesel vehicles. Out of the 81,169 goods vehicles coming under the order, most are used by local traders. Officials admitted that only strict enforcement of the NGT order could take these vehicles completely off roads. However, an official said many of the small commercial vehicles were still in use despite not being re-registered.The silver lining for many owners is that the order is to be implemented in a phased manner. Vehicles older than 10 years but less than 15 years can get a no-objection certificate from the transport department, enabling the owners to sell or re-register the vehicles outside NCR. However, for the private diesel vehicles older than 15 years, it's a death knell. ""We have already got a year-wise list of vehicles which are between 10 and 15 years,"" said a government official./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution: Delhi issues health advisory,"In the wake of alarming air quality in the national capital, the Delhi government on Monday issued a health advisory asking the residents to avoid visiting high pollution area.""People with chronic airway diseases like bronchial asthma and lung disease should avoided outdoor activities including morning and evening walks,"" said the advisory.""In case of breathlessness, giddiness, chest pain or chest constriction or irritation in eyes, please visit the nearest hospital or dispensary or any physician,"" it added, also appealing to people not to panic and help the needy patient seeking medical assistance.The government also advised to consume plenty of fluids and Vitamin C rich fruits like oranges and lemons and do regular gargles with warm water to avoid ill effects of air pollution.Air quality remained ""severe"" in Delhi with Air Quality Index settling at 423 in the city and PM 2.5 levels remaining above 500 at most of the locations in Delhi-NCR./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Apportionment study to find source of pollution: MPPCB,"BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) will conduct Sources Apportionment Study of five cities to find out source of air pollution.The study will cover pollution from vehicles, construction work, industrial, housing and other activities. The cities to be studied are Bhopal, Indore, Ujjain, Dewas and Sagar. MPPCB officials said these five cities have been identified for carrying out the Sources Apportionment Study due to high pollution levels present there. /The study will help identify reasons behind air pollution and arrive at a conclusion as to which source is causing how much pollution. Based on the findings, the authorities will try to cut down pollution levels. However, the process will take time because experts point that at least three years are required for carrying out the study in one city. Besides, the cost of study is around Rs 1.5 crore per city.Pollution is measured by taking into account level of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. Cause of SO2 is vehicles. Nox is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage among others. RSPM 10 is on account of dust, construction, including building of roads, while PM2.5 is as a result of dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Officials said that of the four, PM2.5 is most harmful for health since it goes inside human body and causes severe lung diseases.PCB officials said respirable dust sampler instrument is used for measuring air pollution. Filter paper and cyclone are used for calculating PM10 (respirable particulate matter) and PM2.5, with the help of which dust particles are measured in the air, while absorbent solution helps measure if sulphur dioxide is present.MPPCB chief chemist Shyamanuj Tiwari said the study, which is primarily based on measurements and tracking down the sources, will help in identifying the sources and the extent of their contribution. ""In MP, it is being initiated by efforts of our member secretary AA Mishra. A workshop has been scheduled in the state capital on Thursday in which field experts will present case studies and their findings on ambient air quality in different cities,"" he said.Officials said air pollution problem becomes complex due to multiplicity and complexity of the sources, which include industries, automobiles, domestic fuel burning, dust on road and construction. A cost-effective approach for improving air quality in polluted areas involves identification of emission sources, assessment of extent of contribution of these sources on ambient environment, prioritising the sources that need to be tackled, evaluating various options for controlling the sources and formulation and implementation of action plans.In MP, air quality is monitored at 37 places, including Ujjain, Bhopal, Indore, Dhar, Gwalior, Jabalpur, Sagar, Satna, Singrauli, Shahdol and Katni. Of these, Bhopal has the maximum six air quality monitoring stations.Ambient air quality of Bhopal, Indore, Ujjain, Dewas and Sagar is moderate or close to moderate, which is just above poor category in ambient air quality index./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

HC raps govts for pollution 'genocide',"NEW DELHI: Failure of the government to reduce air pollution amounts to ""genocide"", the Delhi high court observed on Thursday.""Punjab stubble burning is killing us,"" a bench of Justices B D Ahmed and Ashutosh Kumar said, adding that Delhiites are being robbed of three years of their life due to alarming pollution levels.""It is literally capital punishment as the capital is being punished and that too for no offence. People are being killed in the capital,"" an anguished bench remarked, equating reduction of life span due to government inaction as ""genocide and murder.""""As per a report, life expectancy would be 3.2 years less than what it ought to be. Assuming that population of Delhi is 20 million, it would mean that approximately 60 million life years are being robbed from the people of Delhi,"" the bench said, slamming both central and Delhi governments for being concerned with ""ballot box"" instead of human beings.It pointed out that ""despite repeated directions"" and public opinion, the ""governments responsible have not acted in the manner they should have"" on the menace of deteriorating air quality. /The bench also saw satellite images submitted by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) showing stubble burning in northern India, to underline that level of pollutants in the air peaked in first week of November due to biomass burning in Punjab.""Unfortunately, the state of Punjab is in denial mode and contests allegations that they are responsible for air pollution in Delhi. Punjab has not taken action as have the states of Haryana and Rajasthan, despite our clear warning earlier,"" the bench noted. It warned Punjab's top civil servant, the chief secretary that he will face contempt unless he explains why ""our directions were not carried out and what prevented him from doing so"".It gave the state time till November 18 to reply.As regards landfill sites, the court expressed concern over the ""fires simmering"" there aggravating air pollution and observed that the sole solution is to segregate garbage and use it for generation of power.The directions came on a PIL the court initiated suo moto to monitor cleaning up of Delhi air. On the last date of hearing HC had asked the states of UP, Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana to stop stubble burning to ward off the problem of haze. It referred to Delhi government's proposal to convert the closed-down thermal power plant at Rajghat into a waste to energy plant and said the project, which is estimated to take 18 months from start to finish, should be started at the earliest.On reports submitted by Haryana and Rajasthan, the bench said these states are moving in right direction as there is ""no significant contribution (from stubble burning) from these states to Delhi.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Fall in urban air quality showing on health,"KOCHI: The fall in urban air quality increases the risk of stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma, according to the latest report of the World Health Organisation (WHO).The most vulnerable population affected by these high levels of pollution are children. ""They breathe twice as quickly as adults and take in more air.Their air pipes are more porous and thus more vulnerable,"" said Dr Ramesh Kumar, national president-elect, Environment chapter, Indian Academy of Paediatrics.He said that their immune systems are weaker and hence any bronchial condition developed during the stage will affect them for life.Ultrafine, airborne pollutants present in smoke and fumes can easily enter and irritate children's lungs, causing and exacerbating life-threatening diseases. Studies show these tiny particles can also cross the blood-brain barrier, which is less resistant in children, causing inflammation, damaging brain tissue, and permanently impairing cog nitive development. /""They even can cross the placental barrier, injuring the developing foetus when the mother is exposed to toxic pollutants,"" said the latest UNICEF report on children.""Its not the asthmatic children who are vulnerable. The total quality of life in children with bronchial condition is affected,"" he added. Studies have shown that air pollution is strongly associated with respiratory conditions such as pneumonia, bronchitis and asthma, among others. It can also exacerbate underlying health issues and prevent children from going to school, and there is emerging evidence that it can disrupt physical and cognitive development.Air pollution and cardiovascular diseases have an indirect co-relation, say cardiologists.""Patients who have had cardiac failure, valve failure and congenital heart disease (CHD) suffer the most due to air pollution. Patients who have respiratory problems and breathlessness feel shortage of oxygen. This causes a strain on the heart too. Any pressure on the lungs means the heart has to work more,"" said senior cardiologist Dr Rony Mathew Kadavil./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Sea takes care of city air, no need of filter, says HC","Chennai: Making light of a pollution alarm raised in a PIL petition, which said Chennai's air pollution could get as bad as that of the national capital, the Madras high court said there was no cause for such concern here now as the coastal city enjoyed a great locational advantage.Dismissing the plea filed by a mechanical engineer for installation of electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) at polluted public places so that dust could be filtered and ambient air quality improved, the first bench said: ""The petitioner seeks to plead for electrostatic precipitators, which are stated to be highly efficient filtration devices and used for industrial purposes, to be installed. The cause for action is stated to be the Delhi air quality. We are, however, of the view that we are concerned with Chennai and the state of Tamil Nadu and not with Delhi, which has its own peculiar problems so far as air pollution is concerned. /The position is not so in Chennai on account of its locational advantage, being next to the sea and thus sea breeze is of a great assistance on this count. We cannot thus say that in future this problem will arise merely on the say of the petitioner. At present, there is no cause for concern, as the problem does not exist in Chennai.""In his petition, N Janardhanam of Thirumullaivoyal said Delhi's hazardous air quality had turned the city into a gas chamber, and added that doctors cautioned that suspended particle matter could cause respiratory diseases if one was subjected to prolonged exposure. ""We have to capture the dust and smoke particles from atmosphere to achieve clean India,"" he said, adding, ""there are several types of electrostatic precipitators available. But authorities failed to capture the dust and smoke particles from the atmosphere by installing ESPs in polluted public places.""The petitioner said ESPs were highly efficient filtration devices that would slow down flow of gases through the devise and could easily remove fine particles such as dust and smoke from air, he said a suction pump to pass the polluted air in a moderated speed through this devise had to be provided.

Poor Air Quality Can Cause Pneumonia,"By Shailee Prabhu/The Delhi smog situation has opened our eyes to the serious threat of air pollution to our health. While we can enjoy fresh air in Goa, can the same be said of the indoor air quality? Most of the urban population spends almost 12 hours a day indoors and that too in an AC environment, be it in office or time spent on recreation in theatres and malls or even the time sleeping at home./But have we thought if the air indoor is good enough? Has anyone thought of the effect of this untreated air on our health? On World Pneumonia Day today, there may be some thought spared on the subject./Pneumonia is infection of the lungs caused by bacteria, virus, fungi or parasites in the air we breathe. Bacterial pneumonia is the most prevalent one. An interesting perspective of bacterial pneumonia called the legionnaire disease is being increasingly recognized as a deadly, but preventable illness. The causative bacteria, Legionella Pneumophila, which breeds in cooling towers and drain pans proliferates through the air conditioning systems. These bacteria are disseminated in aerosol and come in contact with susceptible individuals, old people, children, immunologically-compromised individuals and infect them./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
B'luru pollution levels rise as combat measures fall short,"Bengaluru: The worst smog clouding Delhi in 17 years comes as a warning to Bengaluru. While laxity in implementation of guidelines issued by the Union government is being blamed for the alarming levels of air pollution in the national capital, Bengaluru is no less guilty. This, despite reporting 5% annual average increase in Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) levels over the past five years.On December 30 last year, the Union ministry of environment and forests issued 42-point guidelines to combat the menace of polluted air. /Though they primarily focused on the National Capital Region (NCR), the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) called upon states to tackle air pollution with the guidelines as the base. The norms had short-term and long-term measures, including controlling vehicular emissions, vacuum cleaning of roads to prevent dust, control of open burning of biomass such as leaves, industrial pollution and from construction and demolition work. Almost a year on, not much has been seen when it comes to the guidelines in Bengaluru or Karnataka in general. Experts say the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) lacks teeth and its role is limited to issuing notices. Chairman Lakshman says, ""Old vehicles like buses and autos that ply on city roads emit black smoke. While not many users bother to get their vehicles checked for air pollution, the agencies concerned need to act against them.""Suresh R, another expert, said though the guidelines call for ensuring strict action against visibly polluting vehicles and steps to prevent parking in non-designated areas, nothing much has been done. ""To arrest road dust, the guidelines call for deployment of wet/ mechanized vacuum sweeping of roads. However, we see very few mechanized sweepers functioning in the city. And there is a need to maintain pothole-free roads for free flow of traffic, to reduce emission and dust. Sadly, this is not happening properly and rising pollution levels are gradually taking a toll on the lungs, especially of children and senior citizens,"" he explained.Asked what they were doing to tackle air pollution, transport department officials said they have been working hard to detect polluting vehicles. ""We've introduced several measures, like random but continuous enforcement checks, where we fine those without pollution under control certificates, as well as a checking mechanism which allows users to find out if the certificates issued are authentic. We are targeting different areas, depending on the kind of traffic, and stopping vehicles for checks. It isn't easy as we are short-staffed too. But knowing vehicular emission is a big contributor, we are encouraging more such drives. We also regularly audit the centres issuing pollution under control certificates,"" said a transport department official.(With inputs from Aditi Sequeira)/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
New Link Road hits roadblock due to shutdown orders on hot-mix plants,"GHAZIABAD: Commissioning of the second lane of the New Link Road in Ghaziabad has hit a roadblock owing to prohibitory orders imposed by the district administration upon operation of hot-mix plants in the city. One side of the 3.6-km-long road, allowing movement of cars and two-wheelers from NH-58 towards NH-24, had been thrown open to public by Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) on November 1.The other lane of the road, which would allow vehicular movement from NH-24 towards NH-58, was tentatively scheduled for opening on November 5-6 following completion of minor works. The opening date was subsequently postponed to November 15. However, on Tuesday, GDA said that the pending work has been stalled because of a ban imposed in the city on operation of hot-mix plants.""Black-topping work on a certain section of the unopened lane close to NH-24 is yet to be completed. /This work has hit a roadblock because hot mix plants in Ghaziabad have been ordered a shutdown. Work cannot be undertaken on this section because of non-availability of tar. Hot mix plants cannot operate till the time the orders of the district magistrate are in prevalence in Ghaziabad. We are waiting for the orders to be lifted,"" GDA executive engineer, Chakresh Jain, told TOI.The ban on hot mix plants in Ghaziabad had been imposed by the district administration in view of the heavy air pollution that was witnessed in early November. The administration had imposed closure orders upon all construction activities as well as operation of hot mix plants in an order issued on November 7. The order had been issued in order to clamp down upon air pollution caused by smoke from burning activities and dust from construction activities.According to GDA officials, there have been no clear instructions on lifting of the closure orders till Tuesday. District magistrate, Nidhi Kesharwani, could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts.

City to get air action plan soon,"Ahmedabad: The state government will give its final touches to a comprehensive air action plan for Ahmedabad city in the coming few days. This will be the second such action plan since 2002. The continuous toxic smoke pumped into our air by the Pirana dump fire, gas leak complaints from the surrounding industrial belt and growing vehicular congestion has been the primary reasons for expediting the action plan.Back in 2002, the Bhure Lal Committee had overseen the implementation of the air action plan for the city which helped roll out of CNG autorickshaws and buses. A lot had changed since then, with pollution levels rising the alarm button has been pressed on rising 2.5-micron particulate matter (PM 2.5), NOx, carbon particles, benzene and ozone levels. /The central pollution control board (CPCB) last year proposed guidelines to 21 states to help them formulate their own air action plans for cities.The action plan will cover aspects like the phasing out of polluting vehicles, adulteration of CNG oils sold on the roadside and better coordination between municipal and police departments in decongestion and ensuring pothole-free roads, which cause jams and lead to concentration of exhaust fumes in local areas. Greening along traffic corridors and major residential areas will gain ground now and new plans, including one for street adoption, will be promoted. Another focus area is automation of the PUC certification system, for which in Delhi a remote sensor-based PUC system was introduced.""PUC standards have not changed for over a decade, even as there is talk of bringing in cleaner Bharat Stage-VI fuel,"" says a senior revenue official. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has already proposed introduction of battery operated vehicles in the congested Walled City. ""Municipal waste burning is a major issue for ambient air pollution.

Dust disease taking its toll on India,"The ""apocalyptic Pollution levels in Delhi"" has been widely reported. The recent ghastly smog has shrouded the national capital for over a week, turning it into a ""gas chamber,"" and showing no sign of dissipating. By 11am, Delhi's air quality index (AQI) was at 724, already far beyond the ""hazardous"" level of 300, according to data from the US embassy's real-time pollution monitoring system. For comparison, the healthy limit is 50. With regards to the condition of our roads, earlier this year, IIT-Kanpur found that 56% of particles below 10 microns was caused by road dust, 10% by industrial points, 10% by concrete batching and only 9% by vehicles. /In the case of PM2.5, the contributions were 38% by road dust, 20% by vehicles, 12% by domestic fuel and 11% by industry. Dust pollution is the main air contaminant and environmental hazard, having extensive health, safety and environmental consequences, and is posing significant risks to everyone and everything. Despite these consequences, it is concerning how little attention is paid to dust management - although recent dust problems have created sharp focus on the issue now.Airborne dust particles can pass through the nasal passage and travel to the deepest regions of the lungs. When anyone breathe in this dust over a prolonged period of time, it can cause a number of respiratory conditions, including breathing difficulties, respiratory pain, diminished lung function and even cancer. However, because these conditions often take several years to develop, both employers and regulators don't take them as seriously as workplace injuries, until now.Recently we have seen a real change in Governments position on the dust problem, especially in Metro's such as Delhi - where the problem is severe.If you see there are other drawback's including wastage of water. Having dust being identified as one of the major contributors to air pollution in Delhi, it is recently on 08th November 2016 the government ordered approximately 25 lakhs little of water sprayed on road to kerb and central verges to settle the dust. In addition to impacting the health of workers, airborne dust can significantly reduce visibility on the road, increasing the risk of vehicle accidents. There are accidents on haulage roads every day in India as a direct result of dust.Global Road Technology, an Australian infrastructure company now based in Pune that specialises in technology for the creation of stabilised roads and environmentally friendly polymer dust binding technologies is calling on Delhi companies to be more proactive about dust management on work sites. Managing dust could be challenging for the mining, power, construction, milling and supporting industries, as dust is inherent to many of industry's essential operations and can be generated from a variety of sources. Global Road Technology specialises in eliminating fugitive dust by applying a patented polymer solution to the surface of roads and paths, that bind soil particles and fugitive dust.This technology eliminates dust immediately, saving client's significant money from their construction and maintenance budgets. It is easy to apply, using a water tanker and spray hose. GRT have been working in communities across the world to deliver this innovative technology, including undertaking a number of projects in Australia, Asia and the Middle East. GRT recently completed a project for the Kumbh Mela to control the dust plumes kicked up by high traffic. They were able to cut dust so that pilgrims could enjoy the Mela without the dust problems, for the first time in the festivals history - which was well received by government, media and especially the visitors. This issue is preventable and the government and business needs to utilise this cost effective technology for immediate results to drastically reduce the toxic particulate levels to ensure health and safety of workers and the general population.(The author of the article is Mr.Ben H James, CEO, Global Road Technology, India)/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

PCB for further tests to detect air pollution,"Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala state pollution control board has asked the contractors engaged by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to stop all activities of hot mix plant set up for runway recarpeting works at Trivandrum International Airport for three days. The directive to M S Khurana Engineering Ltd that executes the runway re-tarring work was issued by PCB environmental engineer on Wednesday, following a site inspection conducted by the PCB team.According to the directive, PCB has to conduct ambient air quality monitoring to evaluate the background ambient air quality and emanation of a particular matter on the premises.The directive further states that PCB had received several complaints regarding the working of hot mix plant and directs the company to install additional pollution control measures, including scrubbing and bag filters to reduce to reduce dust emission.The district medical officer (DMO), who has submitted a report to the district collector on the analysis of the medical camp conducted at Vallakadavu on November 6, also found the hot mix plant as a reason for increasing health issues in the area. A total of 291 people from 218 families attended the medical camp conducted by the DMO and NUHM.""It may be the air pollution from the hot mix plant, as no other reason could be found for the skin disease and allergies related to respiration seen among the residents. /The functioning of plant in the densely populated area is harmful to the health of the residents,"" said DMO (in-charge) Dr Jose G D'Cruz in the report.As per the report, 62 people, including 30 children were found suffering from respiratory diseases and 43 people, including 11 children, were found to be suffering from skin diseases for the past six months.

NGT curbs to boost air quality fail to meet target,"JAIPUR: The week-long National Green Tribunal (NGT) restrictions in Rajasthan to improve the air quality in the NCR concluded on November 15 have partially achieved the set target. The air quality has improved but has not matched the targeted level in the polluted zones of Rajasthan. The ban on all sorts of construction activities, bricks kilns, hot mix plants, sweeping of roads during the night were lifted from Wednesday till the fresh orders from the NGT. /These restrictions came in a bid to improve the air quality in NCR.The Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) will submit a report to NGT in states level meet to be held in Delhi on Thursday. ""The ban has been lifted and I will share the air pollution data before the committee. The RSPCB will follow the next set of instructions, if at all issued in the meeting,"" said Arun Prasad, member general of RSPCB. Even after half a month has passed to Diwali, the highest particle matter 337 ug/m3 (3.7 times higher than the normal) was recorded at VKIA area in Jaipur at 3pm on Wednesday. This scale of pollution is dangerous for people suffering from heart and lung disease. The advisory under this scale says that old and children should avoid heavy exertion.Whereas the lowest was recorded 136 ug/m3 at RIICO area in Jaipur. The air pollution level is scaled on three parameters-Particle matter, nitrogen oxide and Sulphur dioxide. The Air Quality Index (AQI) data calculated on November 16 has Japiur 258 (AQI) which are 2.5 times higher than the normal. Post Diwali it was hovered around 400-450 for days.

"COPD, a disease of the non-smokers too","PUNE: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) has become the fifth deadliest disease across the globe. COPD is always known to be a smoker's disease. Now, non-smoking COPD has now become one of the major issues in developing countries, say experts.Chest physician Nitin Abhyankar said, ""Lower living standards in a country like India have claimed many lives due to COPD. /It is mostly deadly, because we cannot identify the disease and treat it at the right time. Especially when the patient is non-smoking, the diagnosis takes longer.""Apart from bio mass fuels, the current condition of air pollution has also made COPD a major concern in the urban areas. In terms of air pollution, 10 of the 20 most polluted cities in world are from India. In a survey by the Central Pollution Control Board, lung function reduced in 40.3% individuals in Delhi, as compared with 20.1% in control group.""The quality of air that we breathe today is toxic. With the presence of these nano particles in the air, the functionality of our lung is hampered the most. With these living conditions in the urban region, respiratory ailments are of major concern,"" Abhyankar said. COPD is also a major occupational hazard. A National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted a survey and found that industries and occupations at increased risk of COPD ranged from transportation-related occupations; machine operators; construction trades freight, stock, and material handlers; records processing and distribution clerks; sales and waitresses. The fraction of COPD attributable to work was estimated as 19.2 per cent overall and 31.1 per cent among never smokers.A popular product that finds its way in our homes, especially in summers is the ubiquitous mosquito coil.""It may shock us to learn that the mosquito coil emits as much smoke (PM2.5) as those from 100 cigarettes and as much formaldehyde as those from 50 cigarettes! We may not be regular smokers but unwittingly we are inviting trouble by using products that compromise our health,"" he added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

While in India, we do not have any such consolidated estimates. /In recent years, doctors have witnessed an increasing number of cases in which the patient was a never smoker and yet acquired lung cancer. Apart from genetic predisposition, the prime causes of lung cancer in non-smokers are air pollution and second hand smoke,"" says Dr Satish Kamat, senior oncologist, AASHA Cancer Centre Hospital.Dr Bharat Bhosale, consultant, medical and haemato oncologist, Bombay Hospital adds that while the most common lung cancer patient will be a male cigarette smoker; the disease is also reported in a large number of former smokers in whom the damage has already been done in their smoking years. ""Yet, around 15 per cent of the patients are those who have never smoked in life, most common examples of this sub-type are women. More than half of the non-smokers who report lung cancer are women,"" he pointed out. Interestingly, oncologists say that cancers in smokers and non-smokers are different on genetic and molecular level since their causes and triggers are different. Dr Ramakant Deshpande, onco surgeon, Asian Cancer Institute said, ""The symptoms of smokers and non smokers when they contract cancer are also different, these symptoms are subtle and occur at a later stage among non smokers. Non-smokers also tend to overlook the symptoms, as they are not aware that they can be at risk of lung cancer. The symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, pain in the back or shoulder or bone pain for non-smokers. Whereas for smokers the symptoms are violent cough or coughing of blood which can immediately be associated to lung cancer."" Currently, cancers in smokers and non-smokers are treated in a similar way but there is a growing consensus among the medical community that these two types of patients need different approach to treatment./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Weather fluctuation troubles citizens,"Nagpur: A difference of 21 degrees between the day and the night temperature coupled with existence of haze in the weather is keeping city doctors busy.The minimum temperature in the city dipped to 11.1 degrees Celsius on Sunday as against the maximum temperature of 32 degrees Celsius. Doctors say that the huge gap is the reason behind rising respiratory ailments among those staying in city.Pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat said, ""Such extreme variation in temperature has bad effects on health. From last few days, a major chunk of patients are suffering from cold and coughs.""He further informed that presence of haze in such a weather makes condition even worse as it gives rise to all kinds of lung related infections and ailments. /There is also 20% rise in patients coming with different type of lung related diseases. People who have asthma and COPD are the worst sufferers as the disease intensifies.Arbat said, such lung infections have been on rise ever since Diwali due to rise in pollution and drop in temperature. ""After Diwali there is a lot of air pollution due to crackers. Because those are the days when people tend to clean houses, there was a lot of dust in the air.""He said, ""The temperature also started declining from that point of time. Pollutants can't mix easily in the environment during winter and they cause infections. In the middle of all that if city experiences temperature variations to this extent, the situation becomes even worse. Patients have been complaining of fever, runny nose, body ache, laryngitis and tonsillitis.""Meanwhile, paediatricians across the city are reporting a long line of worried parents at their clinics. According to them, the allergy-induced cold is more prevalent these days, which later becomes inflectional too.Paediatrician Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala said, ""Fluctuations in temperature makes children younger than five prone to the risk of respiratory ailments, which, if not treated in time, can cause pneumonia due to low immunity. Cold creates an environment easier for the pneumococcal bacteria to move in the lungs and trigger an infection.""Dr Jhunjhunwala also said, ""At the same time, winter is the healthiest season for children. But these kind of drastic weather variations have opposite effects. Right now the OPD is filled with kids coming with viral fever.""In Vidarbha, city had the second highest maximum temperature after Akola (32.6) and was top in the region with its minimum temperature on the same day./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
City doctors launch 'Gurgaon Against Pollution' campaign,"GURGAON: City doctors, along with traffic cops and officials of public health and Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) have launched an anti-pollution campaign ""Gurgaon Against Pollution - Let's Fight Back"".Launched on the occasion of World Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Day, the campaign will roll out an online portal on pollution wherein all stakeholders in the city can give out pollution-related information to people. The portal will facilitate all the information pertaining the pollution levels in different parts of Gurgaon, such as how far certain pollutants are above the normal range, precautionary measures, experts speak, kind of masks doctors recommend to different sections and other recommendations.""The portal will help not only those suffering from COPD, but everybody who wants to get answers of all key questions regarding pollution, its ill-effects and prevention measures under one roof,"" said Dr. Himanshu Garg, Head of department, Respiratory and Critical Care, Artemis Hospital.""The portal is a way to ensure that every piece of information related to pollution control is reached to people and perfect synergy can be maintained among government, hospitals and different organizations related to pollution control. It is a much-needed step,"" said Rajiv Chhiber from Public Health Foundation of India.""The anti-pollution movement aims to reach wide population in Gurgaon and educate them about practical solutions to control the pollution levels. We stand with doctors to do whatever possible to bring down dust pollution in the city,"" said Vijay Chaudhary, Senior Scientist at HSPCB.Mamta Kharb, ACP, Traffic said, ""Traffic cops are the worst victims of air pollution. /I am glad that this campaign has been launched. I would want the doctors, environmental experts and pollution control board to bring some special camps and programmes for traffic cops."" Emphasizing on the importance of improving air quality, not just in outdoor but also indoor environment, Priyank Agarwal, head of Strategy and New Business, Philips, India, said, ""People are becoming aware about the worsening situation that toxic air is causing, even in the comfort of their homes. They are adopting measures like installing air purifiers to remove contaminants such as harmful gases, fine-dust and pollen and also general germs, bacteria and viruses"".Over 40 doctors from the city have joined the campaign. COPD is a lung disease that damages the airways inside the lungs, causing chest \xADtightness, shortness of breath and persistent cough. World Health Organisation recognises COPD as the 6th largest killer and this is likely to become the 3rd biggest killer in few years.

30% to 60% of lung cancer patients in B'luru are non-smokers: Docs,"<a href=""mailto:Sreemoyee.Chatterjee@timesgroup.comBengaluru"">Sreemoyee.Chatterjee@timesgroup.comBengaluru</a>/: Radha, 54, complained of a sudden hoarseness in her voice and chronic cough only to be diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. Her family was devastated and shocked in equal measure. A doctor herself, Radha led a healthy lifestyle and was a non-smoker. A year later, she succumbed to the killer disease.When Karthik, 45, a software engineer and a fitness freak, visited a city hospital with pain in the right side of his chest, radiology reports revealed water accumulation in his right lung. /The biopsy report threw up a shocker - the techie had adenocarcinoma and the cancer had progressed to its third stage. ""His survival chances are only 30% and he may not live beyond five years,"" said the oncologist treating Karthik, also a non-smoker.Contrary to the notion that smoking is the prime cause of lung cancer, city doctors say 30% to 60% of the patients are non-smokers. Most of them are women. Air pollution, exposure to radiation and passive smoking are the contributing factors.""Of the 500 patients walking into the hospital with lung cancer, at least 200 are non-smokers. The incidence has gone up from 5-6 persons (for a population of 1,00,000) to 12-13 in Bengaluru. In Delhi, the figure stands at 16-17 persons,"" said Dr C Ramesh, professor and head of the epidemiology and biostatistics department at Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology.Dr Neelesh Reddy, consultant oncologist, Columbia Asia hospitals, pointed out that women are at a higher risk. If a man and woman smoke an equal number of cigarettes, it's the woman who is more susceptible to the cancer, he said.Doctors say though most patients diagnosed with lung cancer are from urban and semi-urban areas, the incidence is rising among the rural population as well. ""Many cases are not registered due to the lack of proper healthcare facilities in rural areas,"" Dr Reddy added. According to Dr Ramesh, indoor pollution caused by asbestos and smoke is to blame. Doctors feel the ban on smoking in public places should be implemented more effectively. They also say in over 80% of the cases, the disease is diagnosed only at an advanced stage. ""The government should start screening programmes for both smokers and non-smokers, who should be made to undergo low-dose chest CT scans,"" said Dr BS Ajaikumar, chairman and CEO, Healthcare Global Enterprises Limited (HCG Cancer Hospital).Dr Vivek Anand Padegal, consultant pulmonologist, Fortis Hospital, said many non-smokers respond better to chemotherapy and other forms of treatment compared to smokers. ""Access to oral chemotherapy should be made easier and more affordable,"" he said. (Some names have been changed)No screening programme There is no proper screening programme for lung cancer and oral cancer, which has the highest incidence in India. We must educate people about personal hygiene and ways to avoid pollution and passive smoking. People shouldn't wait for the symptoms to show up and instead, go for annual check-ups. On anniversaries and birthdays, one can gift a lung cancer check-up voucher to their dear ones Dr Somashekhar S P, chairman, Manipal Comprehensive Cancer CentreOlder women more at risk in rural areasLung cancer tops the list of cancers among men, with 1 lakh new cases being detected per year. Women, however, account for the majority of lung cancer patients who don't smoke. In western countries, only 10% to 15% of lung cancer patients are non-smokers. In India, the statistic is more than 40%. In rural Karnataka, women have been exposed to kitchen smoke for long. Only recently have households got access to gas cylinders.

"Supreme Court bans selling of fire crackers in NCR, directs Centre to suspend licenses of all sellers","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday put a blanket ban on selling of fire crackers in National Capital Region in order to curb the life threatening pollution level in Delhi saying the capital was 'smogged' into an environmental emergency of unseen proportions.A bench of Chief Justice T S Thakur and Justices A K Sikri and S A Bobde directed the Centre to suspend all licenses allowing sale of fireworks, wholesale and retail within the NCR and also directed the government not to renew or grant fresh license to sellers till its further order. The court's order would put the firecrackers out of reach to people in Delhi, Noida, Gaziabad, Gurugram and surrounding areas.The court, however, ruled out the proposition to ban use of firecrackers as a measure to curb rising pollution level, saying that ban on use was not feasible as it would be difficult to implement the order.The court said that the life of the citizens of NCR was brought to a virtual standstill due to life-threatening level of pollution, compelling it to intervene to protect life of people. Observing that the adverse effects of the extreme levels of air pollution has spared no one in the city, the court said India has got a distinction of world's highest death rate from chronic respiratory diseases and about 1.5 million people die annually due to indoor and outdoor pollution.""The fall in air quality has had a significant impact on people's lifestyle as well. /The rising costs to protect against air pollution are substantial. It has come to our notice that people are queuing up to purchase protective masks and air purification systems in the wake of dense smog all over the NCR. In short, the capital was smogged into an environmental emergency of unseen proportions,"" the bench said.It said Air Quality Index in the NCR is abysmally severe and allowing trade in fireworks, a major source of noise and air pollution and causing immense harm to the lives and health of citizens, constitutes a serious invasion of the Freedoms and Rights conferred on citizens by the Constitution.Justice Bobde, who wrote the judgement, noted that increase in respiratory diseases like asthma, lung cancer, bronchitis etc. was primarily attributable to the worsening air quality in the NCR. ""Needless to state, the grim situation of air quality adversely affected the right to education, work, health and ultimately, the right to life of the citizens, and this Court is constitutionally bound to address their grave concerns,"" the bench said.""All this firework, even that which is not noisy, leaves the ambient air thick with noxious particles. Marriage processions, barats, passing through an area generated the same kind of noise and leave behind the same kind of air, by the use of fire crackers. It is not necessary to speculate if those who suffer send their good wishes for the event,"" it said.The bench said that ban on selling fire crackers would adversely affect the business of traders but justified its decision saying that the ban was in the larger public interest.""There is no doubt that protecting citizens by making these unavailable in the market would require the suspension of trade of a miniscule section of the population. Maybe they have acquired stocks for sale or obtained credit for their business. We are, however, of the view that balancing the vital interests of the vast majority of citizens against the commercial interests of a few, the balance must heavily tilt in favour of citizens in general,"" it said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Study: Patna's air quality worst in country, again","Patna: The air quality index (AQI) in the state capital on Tuesday stood at 476, the highest in the country and probably the highest-ever in the city. The AQI in Patna was the highest in the country even on Monday and the second highest on Sunday.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has put the AQI in Patna in the 'severe' category, which means breathing such air affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases.Incidentally, the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) had issued an advisory to the state government last year after the AQI of Patna crossed 400 mark in November-December, breaking all its past records in the state capital.The AQI is an assessment of the air quality taking into account eight pollutants: PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 10 micron), PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 micron), nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, ammonia and lead.Air pollution, primarily higher level of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), has been a cause a concern in Patna even on normal days. The level of particulate matter is normally recorded thrice the normal level of respective standard of 100 micrograms per cubic metre. /Even on Tuesday evening, the level of PM2.5 in Patna was measured at 443.99 micrograms per cubic metre. Suspended particulate matter is the biggest contributor to air pollution in the state capital.BSPCB chairman and forest department principal secretary Vivek Kumar Singh admitted the higher level of air pollution in the city and claimed that compressed natural gas (CNG) would be introduced by the end of 2017 to bring down the pollutants level.""Though we have been able to introduce clean brick manufacturing technology, high level of vehicular density in the city still remains a cause of concern. We need to hit the root cause of pollution; hence, we are soon going to introduce CNG for vehicles,"" Singh told TOI.""We are already in talks with GAIL as they are presently developing a CNG pipeline network passing through Bihar. They have assured us to provide the pipeline connectivity to Patna by 2017-end,"" Singh said.BSPCB member-secretary S Chandrashekhar attributed the surge in AQI to the onset of winter conditions and dust on roads. ""The level of particulate matter or dust particles in the air in Patna is recorded quite higher than the respective permissible level. Moreover, November-December is considered a crucial period with regard to the particulate matter. The soot-like particles settle down in low temperature conditions, making the air in the lower level of atmosphere more polluted,"" Chandrashekhar told TOI on Tuesday.He said the BSPCB would issue an advisory to the state government to take necessary action to bring down the 'alarming' level of AQI in the state capital. Incidentally, several recommendations made by the BSPCB in its last year's advisory to curb air pollution are already gathering dust.

"Bad air killing more than expected in India, China: Greenpeace report","NEW DELHI: As countries become richer, air pollution-related deaths reduce. This is the general trend for most nations except India and China, a report released by Greenpeace on Friday has found. The study, which assesses the GDP per capita versus deaths resulting from toxic air, revealed India and China had higher death rates than what is expected of countries with similar per capita GDP. /This is particularly true when deaths caused by air pollution are mapped for 15 middle-income countries.The report also states that air pollution may have caused more than 1.6 million additional deaths than a projected death number based on GDP growth rate for 2015 in India and China collectively. The report sources the number of such deaths from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) report and GDP per capita estimations for all countries from a recent World Bank document.""This report puts a question mark on the quality of economic development the two countries are offering to their people. Usually, air pollution has an inverse relationship with the country's GDP. We find that as countries become richer, they generally develop less polluting industries. But in the case of India and China, the trend has been quite the opposite: despite their economic growth, both countries have particularly poor air quality. It is clear that an economy heavily reliant on coal can only spell doom for its people,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta of Greenpeace East Asia. Although air pollution death rates have fallen in China and India since 1990, they are still worse than in most similar countries, the report said. In India, rates have not improved since 2010. In 2015, pollution claimed 138 and 115 lives per 1,00,000 people in India and China respectively, it added.According to its GDP per capita, the expected death rate in India is 94 per 1,00,000 but its death rate remains 138. ""So, unlike China, it has not yet reached an income level where its air pollution death rate could be expected to be similar to that in rich countries.

14 ways to protect your children from air pollution,"We all know that the most common causes of air pollution are vehicles, industrial waste and pollution, forest fires, unpaved roads and household combustion devices. The pollutants found in them are particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and sulphur dioxide. /Some pollutant particles can be seen with the naked eyes, while others can only be detected with the help of an electron microscope. No matter what type of air pollutant it is, these particles are harmful to everyone, especially children who are most susceptible to its dangerous effects.

"'Don't burn green waste, compost it'","Navi Mumbai: The green activists have urged the civic body to start composting organic waste in all the municipal gardens instead of burning it and causing air pollution.""We have noticed that most of the civic gardens are not composting the organic waste such as leaves, twigs and grass. These are supposed to be put in a freshly dug up pit. /However the local gardeners are merely burning it, causing smoke, and adding to the air pollution,'' said activist Arati Chauhan of Harit Navi Mumbai group.She added that they found, after a preliminary survey of several civic gardens, that composting is being done at just two or three sites.

"Here's what you didn't see at Bhandewadi, Mr Kadam","Nagpur: A peculiar odour swept across Bhandewadi a couple of days ago. It's not often that residents, staying in the unauthorized layouts spread in the periphery of the dump yard, are subjected to this smell. They say it happens only when the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) processing plant composting machine is operated. It also signified another thing: The machine was being operated for the impending visit of a high-ranking official. /""Otherwise,"" residents say, ""shouldn't we be getting the smell more often.""The visit took place on December 7. And the high-ranking official was state environment minister Ramdas Kadam and an entourage that comprised Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) chairman Satish Gavai, member secretary P Anabalagan and municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar. After the inspection, the minister is believed to have found everything in order. ""I will not talk anything now, meet me after the winter session of the assembly,"" Kadam told TOI.But what Kadam saw was only what he was shown. It's what he wasn't shown and informed about that is causing problems to the residents. For several years now, between 7pm and 6am, a heavy smog hangs during winters over Bhandewadi and in a radius of a few kilometres. The problem of air pollution, however, is always the same in any season. And it's not just the vicinity of Bhandewadi. Members of Deshpande Jansamsaya Niwaran Samiti have complained to MPCB that areas like Deshpande Layout, Hiwri Nagar and Vaishnodevi Square are also covered with 'cloud of burnt smell.'Garbage burning in the dump yard seems to be the main cause of air pollution at Bhandewadi where a large percentage of the city's garbage is seen smouldering at regular distances. In May last year, the dump yard was on flames. Even today, there is no end to fire outbreaks, cause of which is not conclusively known. Data available with NMC's fire department shows that fire tenders are sent to Bhandewadi quite often to arrest small fires. In November, tenders were rushed at the site around eight times at morning, noon and evening hours. On Thursday too, there was a fire outbreak.In May last year, TOI has reported that unregulated trash burning is endangering urban lives by pumping cancer-causing pollutants in the atmosphere and also creating a fire hazard for thousands of residents living in the periphery. It's been more than a year and the situation has come to a boil.In winters, the smog is so heavy that residents get trapped in zero visibility. ""In mornings, while going to school, our auto rickshaw driver can't even see the road properly. Last month, a motorist met with an accident,"" says a young girl living behind the dump yard. Jai Shanker Pandey, chief scientist, science secretary and head, climate change in National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri), explains the reason behind smog. ""When the temperature is high and air is warmer, pollution has better diffusivity, which is to say that it dissipates into the air more easily. In winters, thanks to the colder, heavier air, an invisible barrier is created, and the air pollution gets trapped close to the ground. Thus, air pollution becomes a critical problem,"" he says. Unscientific disposal and garbage burning is taking a toll on human health with release of toxic and cancer-causing pollutants into the atmosphere. Fifty-six-year-old Sheikh Mohammad Gulam, who stays around 500 metres away from the dump yard, is severely asthmatic. Every year, between November to January, he spends his nights at a rented room which is three-four kilometres away. ""After 7pm, the smog increases and I face heavy breathlessness.

"Noida's air, and home of birds, under assault","Noida: A bonfire of dried leaves, twigs and tree branches continues to rage on a stretch leading up to the Okhla Bird Sanctuary (OBS), a few steps away from its entrance at the Noida end, despite a standing ban on leaf burning imposed by the National Green Tribunal.The fire is steadily spreading on the horticultural waste lying on the kilometre-long stretch, with no one to care a fig for the lasting damage the smoke is doing to the environment. The green waste is set on fire periodically.The burning of horticultural waste in the area, which is part of the eco-sensitive zone of the OBS, is now a routine affair.Officers and forest guards stationed at the sanctuary told TOI that the horticultural waste was being set on fire by Noida Authority workers themselves. The waste is dumped in the area for some days and then someone turns up one fine day and sets it on fire, an OBS official said.Strangely enough, the Noida Authority's horticulture department feigned ignorance about dumping of waste or the burning. /""The side of the road where the waste is burning is not under our jurisdiction, we can't say who is burning the leaves there,"" Om Bir Singh, director, horticulture, said.""The Noida Authority has repeatedly been advised to not burn horticultural waste in the city. We have told them many times too, especially with the NGT regulations in place, it is a serious violation of the rules.

Namma Kudla takes a conscious step towards Shuddha Gaali,"MANGALURU: A city-based NGO has taken up Shuddha Gaali, a project to assess the air quality at 12 prominent spots. The project is floated by APD Foundation in association with St George's Homeopathy, a firm promoting better health. OneEarth Enviro Labs, a Mangaluru-based laboratory, is gathering the data. /The results will be submitted to the government for perusal and action. This will also help Mangalureans understand air quality levels based on five different parameters in their areas.""In the drive to make Mangaluru the least-polluted city in the country, we'll monitor air pollution, principal sources and begin work on mitigation of pollution at the points of origin. Pilikula was the last of the 12 spots we identified to test air quality,"" said Abdullah A Rehman, founder, APD Foundation. ""Air pollution is the silent killer and considered a major cause of death and the source of many life-threatening diseases, affecting vital organs of the human body. Ranked the fifth largest killer in India, it's also the most contributing cause of asthma in children. Mangaluru is ranked eighth among the cleanest cities in India and is among the least-polluted cities. But in the recent past, with drastic increase in population, vehicular movement and unplanned infrastructure development, the city has seen a rise in traffic congestion and pollution levels. The growing menace of air pollution in New Delhi has raised many tough questions,"" Abdullah said.The government has placed air quality monitoring station in Baikampady, an industrial enclave while residents live in the city limits. ""We have no understanding of the air quality measures in areas of our residence or work. We have no understanding of quality of air our children breathe in their schools. In the light of this concern, APD for the citizens of Mangaluru, has aggregated experts to commence a study on air quality of Mangaluru city. This project will vastly bridge the gap for the Government to act accordingly in terms of mitigation of air pollution in the city and to achieve the status of least polluted city in India. This project will also help us to understand if the Air quality in Mangaluru city limits meets the National Ambient,"" he said. Ambient air quality monitoring under five parameters including particulate matter (SPM/RSPM), PM10, SPM, PM2, SO2, NO2 and lead have been done at PVS Junction, Hampankatta, Bunder, Central Market, Lalbagh, Bejai, Jyothi Circle, Nanthoor, Baikampady, Pumpwell, Kankanady and Attavara for eight hours.

"Winters and air pollution double risk of disease in elders, kids","LUCKNOW: Battling diseases and infections is a twin challenge in winters, say doctors in the city. Blaming air pollution for complicating the situation, they said that children, sick and elderly suffered more than anyone else.""While winter itself leads to physiological changes which make one vulnerable to illnesses, pollution adds to the risk. The reason is that humidity level which goes up significantly in winter months brings air pollutants in their breathing range which doubles the risk of disease,"" said Dr BP Singh, private pulmonologist.Professor and head of pulmonology department, AIIMS New Delhi, Dr Randeep Guleria stated that exposure to cold causes constriction of airways due to which less air reaches the lungs. /""The problem aggravates when we breathe polluted air. They cause irritation and inflammation of the airways. New research shows pm2.5 tends to spill over to the bloodstream as well, causing narrowing of the blood vessels that could lead to heart attack or stroke,"" he said.Physician Dr DP Mishra said that children, elderly and sick is low are an easy target because their immunity level is comparatively low. ""Children suffer because they breathe more than elders every minute and their immune system is not fully developed, they are at a higher risk of disease. Elders on the other hand have a fragile system. The sick are at a risk because their immune system stays busy at fighting their existing disease,"" he explained.He added that chronic exposure to high-level pollutants is regarded as big a risk factor for heart attack and stroke as high cholesterol and smoking. ""Patients at both extremes of age are vulnerable due to weaker immunity,"" he stated.Persistent high pollution also prolongs the recovery period for patients admitted for respiratory diseases. Dr Ved Prakash at King George's Medical University said prevention is the best cure. ""Outdoor activity of people with known history of a lung disease should be restricted on times of the day - like early morning - when pollution levels are high. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination is advised to those predisposed to infections,"" he stated.The double attack has already landed many to city hospitals. ""The number of elders falling prey to seasonal chest infections or aggravated medical condition has doubled in the past fifteen days,"" said geriatric physician, Dr Abhishek Shukla who attended 30-35 patients per day on an average in November. The rate of hospitalisation has also increased by 20%, he added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Karnataka state pollution control board vans to help Regional transport authority check air pollution,"MYSURU: Users of vehicles emitting smoke beyond permissible limits and causing air pollution will have to be careful. Reason: Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) will soon introduce an emission testing van to check air pollution in Mysuru city. KSPCB will assist Regional Transport Authority (RTA) officials in checking air pollution by vehicles, and the latter will initiate action against erring vehicle users. /If caught, the offenders will have to cough up Rs 1,000 for the first offence, and Rs 2,000 for the second and subsequent offences. The move is expected to effectively facilitate the authorities to check pollution by vehicles. In the absence of a mobile emission testing unit, RTO officials hitherto had difficulty in checking pollution. Now, they can avail the services of KSPCB for the same.Penalty based on reportKSPCB officer M G Raghuram said the board has purchased 16 mobile emission testing vans in Karnataka. Of them, 8 will be used in Bengaluru and others in Mysuru, Kalaburagi, Mangaluru and Dharwad districts. ""Our officers will assist RTO officials during special drives and give a report on emission levels on the spot. Transport officials will penalize motorists if their vehicles are polluting (referring to the report),"" he added.The service will be launched by KSPCB in Mysuru on Wednesday. Initially, the vehicle will be used in city areas. If required, it will be taken to neighbouring districts Mandya, Kodagu, Chamarajanagar and Hassan, which also come under KSPCB.An RTO official said that due to lack of facility, they were not checking if vehicles were polluting. But they were ensuring that vehicles adhere to emission norms when they are brought to their office for any document work like transfer of ownership and fitness certificate. As per statistics, Mysuru has just over 6 lakhs vehicle, of which 85% are two-wheelers./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Visakhapatnam: Guard against Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease cases in winter,"VISAKHAPATNAM: Last month, World COPD Day was observed on the theme 'Breathe in the Knowledge'. Usually, in winter, owing to the cold and air pollution, including suspended smog, COPD cases coming to the hospital increase by about 30 per cent.Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) refers to a number of breathing problems damaging the breathing tubes and air sacs within the lungs. It's a common lung disease that obstructs the airways, making breathing difficult. Inhaling certain dust, fumes, chemicals or gases in the workplace can cause serious long-term lung damage.According to estimates of the World Health Organisation (WHO), globally around 210 million people are suffering from COPD and by 2030, this life-threatening lung disease would become the third leading cause of death worldwide.The primary cause of COPD is tobacco smoke (through tobacco use or secondhand or passive exposure to smoke) as well as exposure to excessive air pollution - both indoor air pollution (such as biomass fuel used for cooking and heating) and outdoor air pollution and smog, occupational dusts and chemicals (vapours, irritants, and fumes). Though not curable, but it can be prevented and the progress of the disease can be slowed down through treatment.Medical superintendent of Government Hospital for Chest and Infectious Diseases Dr Sambasiva Rao said, ""Though throughout the year we get patients suffering from COPD, the number usually goes up in winter by up to 30 per cent due to the cold climate and increased pollutants suspended in the air as smog, a harmful combination of smoke and fog.""Dr Anantha Lakshmi, chest physician at Care Hospital averred, ""Since there is no cure but it can be treated, the earlier it's detected, the better the results of treatment. /Medicines that help dilate major air passages of the lungs can improve shortness of breath. Adults may have COPD if they have trouble breathing, or feel short of breath or develop a cough that refuses to go away. COPD is confirmed by a simple diagnostic test called 'spirometry' that measures how much air a person can inhale and exhale and how fast air can move into and out of the lungs. Because COPD develops slowly, it's frequently diagnosed in people aged 40 years or older.Suggesting the measures which one can follow to prevent or control COPD, pulmonologists point to the need to absolutely quit smoking and getting oneself secured from passive smoking. ""One should strictly adhere to medicines as suggested by the doctor and visit the doctor at least twice a year for check-ups and visit the hospital right away if the breathing worsens. One should keep the air clean at home and stay away from things such as smoke that make it hard to breathe. Also, keep the body strong. Walk, exercise regularly and eat healthy foods,"" stated Dr Lakshmi.Also, many people have the habit of going for regular morning and evening walks. ""However, it's advisable that during winters, people should undertake morning walks a little late after sunrise, when the fog or smog is cleared. They should also try to be inside the house after 7 pm as during the early morning and late evenings, harmful pollutants including smog gets suspended in the air and adversely affects the lungs. People should also use masks if it's absolutely necessary to go out in the smoke,"" suggested Dr Sambasiva Rao./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

For those suffering from bronchitis, asthma and allergies, the air is particularly unkind. The accompanying symptoms, say physicians, are far worse with running nose, chest congestion, cough and burning eyes. /During the winter, the polluted air and particulate matter does not rise, making the ambient air quality very poor.Dr Prashant Chhajed, chest physician and pulmonologist at Fortis Vashi said that those suffering from chest ailments should be careful. ""During this season, anyone who experience tightening in the chest, chronic breathlessness and persistent cough must seek medical attention immediately,"" he advised. He suggests that patients who suffer from asthma or any other pre-existing condition, must ensure to take their medication regularly. For children, a persistent cold and cough that stays over a week is not a healthy sign and must be checked.""If you're an athlete, try to wear a mask over your mouth and nose. It will reduce the amount of pollutants you may be inhaling. If you are working out or running, select an indoor space or some place away from traffic or highways,"" he added. On days when the air is especially bad, added Dr Chhajed, avoid getting outdoors. He suggested that if you have a work-from-home policy, try to do so at least every alternate day.

Puri Swargadwar chimney lying defunct since 2014,"BHUBANESWAR: The Puri municipality is allegedly sitting over the direction of the Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB) to operationalize the scientific chimney installed at 'Swargadwar' (crematorium) to filter the smoke emanating during burning of bodies. At least 40 bodies are cremated at Swargadwar every day. Since Puri is a holy place, people prefer to take the bodies there for cremation. /The Swargadwar, located along the sea beach, leaves smoke as the bodies are burnt in the open instead of under the chimney. The chimney, installed by the OSPCB in 2014 remained functional for only eight months. Meanwhile, the OSPCB has sent three reminders to the Puri civic body to fix the problem. Around seven bodies can be burnt at a time below the platform where the chimney has been installed. ""Pollution board sources said the defunct chimney is leading to huge air pollution. The open burning of bodies leaves particulate matter (Pm-10) of 727 microgram per metre cube from the cremation ground against the permissible limit of 100,"" said OSPCB regional officer (Bhubaneswar) Hadibandhu Panigrahi.A environment campaigner, Subash Dutta, had filed a petition in National Green Tribunal (NGT) regarding the rising pollution level in the town due to crematorium. The NGT then directed the OSPCB and the Puri municipality to filter the smoke and thereafter the scientific chimney was installed. The OSPCB later handed over the chimney maintenance work to the Puri civic body, which since then has failed to make it operationalize it. ""Recently we floated expression of interest (EoI) inviting interested parties for the repair of the chimney. But none came forward. We will consult with the pollution board officials to help us hire an expert in the field to fix the problem,"" said executive officer (Puri municipality) Sanjay Mishra.

Arvind Kejrwal's odd-even model can cut deadly vehicular emissions,"HYDERABAD: The city may soon have to replicate Delhi chief minister Kejriwal's odd-even rule to combat the rising levels of pollution, indicates data available with pollution monitoring bodies.Deadly pollutants including sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide are adding to the air pollution in city besides the rising PM 2.5 levels.According to S Jeevanand Reddy, the convener of the Forum for Sustainable Environment, the main cause of particulate matter in the air is vehicular emission.""While the advancement in the vehicular technology should have brought the pollution levels down, it had not been the case in Hyderabad. Goods vehicles continue to use adulterated fuel here to cut costs. Emissions from vehicles are the chief contributors of NOx or oxides of nitrogen. /When they react with other particles in the air, there can be an increase in the ground-level ozone content. This, in turn, leads to severe health complications. City buses, which are more than 15 years old, are also major pollutants,"" he said.Reddy has done extensive studies on air pollution in the city.The state pollution control board's figures only reinstate the ugly reality. While in 2010, the NOx levels in pockets such as Jubilee Hills and Charminar varied between 16 and 17, it shot up to 24.2 and 32.1 respectively in 2015.The scenario is no different this year. In July, the NOx levels in the Charminar region stood at 22.3, while the same jumped to 32.5 in October. The sulphur dioxide content has also seen a steady increase in this area. From 4.8 in July 2016, the SO2 level in the Charminar region shot up to 5.1 in October. In Jubilee Hills, the SO2 level has jumped from 4.5 in July to 4.9 in October.Doctors are predictably worried. ""There has been an exponential increase in the number of people showing up with respiratory conditions and breathing difficulties the past few months. While initial symptoms of exposure to polluted air include breathlessness, dry cough and tightness in the chest, prolonged exposure can even lead to diseases such as cancer. Authorities must act now to prevent a Delhi-like situation from playing out here,"" said SA Rafi, consultant pulmonologist at Care Hospitals in Banjara Hills.Doctors recommend wearing masks to avoid the problem, but it is effective only for large particle and can't prevent small particles being inhaled./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Govt asks farmers to stop burning sugarcane thrash,"Bengaluru: As part of its smoke-management strategy, the Karnataka government has issued a diktat to farmers: Stop burning sugarcane thrash in the fields.The move comes in the backdrop of the recent Delhi smog which was fuelled by the burning of paddy straw in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana. In fact, the soaring pollution levels and falling visibility levels in the National Capital Region had not only set alarm bells ringing a fortnight ago but also triggered a blame game between the Delhi government, the neighbouring states and the Centre.The practice of burning sugarcane residue is rampant in at least ten districts across Karnataka.Taking a cue from the Delhi episode, Karnataka has got into a prevention mode. Agriculture minister C Krishna Byregowda has commenced talks with farmers' groups. He has instructed the agriculture department's field units to stop farmers from burning crop residue.Speaking to STOI, Byregowda said: ""About 50 lakh tonnes of sugarcane residue (which comprises the leafy extraneous material and stalk tops after the cane is cut and transported to sugar factories) is burnt by farmers during the harvest season. /The amount of smoke and ash from these fires is huge and the health hazards posed are difficult to fathom. Worst affected by the burning of crop will be the cities of Bengaluru, Mysuru and Belagavi as the major sugarcane-growing districts are Mandya, Belagavi and Bagalkot.""An acre of sugarcane produces around 4,000 tonnes of thrash. With sugarcane being grown on 12 lakh hectares in the state, the sugarcane residue is said to be around 50 lakh tonnes.The agriculture department shot off a letter on December 12 to all chief executive officers of sugarcane-growing districts explaining the emergency. The missive stated: ""Burning residue is not just a loss to agriculture but also pollutes environment and causes ailments and deaths. Air pollution in India causes more than 1,500 premature deaths per day; this is more than one death per minute. For 12 lakh acres of sugarcane in Karnataka, it amounts to burning 48 lakh tonnes of valuable organic matter. This will emit tens of thousands of toxic pollutants into the air.""The department wants sugarcane farmers to use technology and convert the waste into manure.Byregowda said: ""The cane residue is valuable organic matter that should be incorporated into the soil. It will increase cane yield and improve soil sustainability. We want our farmers to hire tractor-mounted cane thrash shredders which are available at reasonable rates from the Krishi Yantra Dhare Kendras (farm equipment rental centres), and convert thrash into organic manure.""Initially, the government contemplated imposing a blanket ban on burning sugarcane residue. ""But before doing that we chose to create awareness and motivate farmers to stop burning, We want to stop pollution levels from soaring further."" Byregowda said.What is sugarcane thrash?A sugarcane plant consists of 75-80% stalk, from which juice is extracted to make sugar. The remaining 20-25 per cent consists of leafy material and stalk tops; these are considered sugarcane residue or thrash or remnants.Where does cane burning happen?It usually happens in the sugarcane-growing districts of Bagalkot, Bidar, Belagavi, Chamarajanagar, Davanagere, Kalaburagi, Hassan, Mandya, Mysore and Vijayapura.Why do farmers burn it?Burning is the easiest and quickest way to get rid of large volumes of trash - and is less labour-intensive. It is not be an additional financial burden on farmers as it involves no transportation or disposal costs. Burning is believed to raise productivity, and shortens harvesting time by a couple of days./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Industry's top choice of fuel cheap but deadly,"NEW DELHI: The national capital region (NCR) may be one of the most polluted regions in the country but many industries located here are still running on an extremely polluting fuel-furnace oil.A substantially cheaper alternative to natural gas and diesel, FO, as it is called in industrial terminology , is marginally better than bitumen in quality .It emits substantially higher particulate matter (PM) and secondary sulphate particles, said scientists.The widespread use of FO came to light only recently after the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) investigated its use in NCR and submitted a report to SC. The report also highlighted the use of pet coke, another high sulphur fuel, in NCR.Industries in Ghaziabad's Sahibabad and Loni Road industrial areas admit that they use FO despite knowing how harmful it is for environment. A large steel company TOI visited in Sahibabad, for instance, runs its generator on FO and natural gas.""It's a 30:70 ratio, with FO making 70% of the fuel. It's cheap and serves the purpose. /I don't think the Supreme Court can ban it because industries are a powerful lobby . Also, what will oil refineries do with the FO they generate?"" said its head of purchase. FO is priced around Rs 25 per litre, compared to Rs 56.76 for diesel, Rs 69.3 for petrol and Rs 24.5 per standard cubic meter for piped natural gas.About three months ago, the price of FO fell to Rs 15 per litre due to the dip in crude oil prices. ""The prices fell seven times in the past year or so. It just makes economic sense for industries to opt for a cheaper fuel. Of course, it's way more polluting and you can tell from the chimney smoke whether a factory is using FO. It's usually black or blue smoke. That's why we invested in piped gas supply ,"" said a senior representative from another steel company's hot rolling and heat treatment division.TOI also found several dyeing, paper recycling and glass industries using FO.A representative from Indo Petro, a dealer, said, ""Many industries in Delhi too use it illegally because it's cheaper.""Anant Bhargav, director of IFP Petro Products, said, ""The government can have Bharat Standard (BS)-type norms for industrial fuel. Some industries even use very toxic tyre oil made from used rubber and ty res. Major dealers supply these fuels.""Around 30 forging industries use FO in Ghaziabad, added an Industrial Area Manufacturer's Association member.Mukesh Sharma, scientist at IIT Kanpur and author of Comprehensive Study on Air Pollution and Green House Gases (GHGs) in Delhi -the latest source apportionment study , said, ""The PM emissions from FO are substantially higher than other liquid or gaseous fuels. Since the sulphur content in FO and pet coke is high, a large amount of sulphur dioxide (SO2) is released that converts into fine sulphate particles in the atmosphere.""The sulphur content in FO is 15,000 to 20,000 ppm and about 70,000 ppm in pet coke compared to around 50 ppm in diesel. Scientists recommend that high sulphur fuel should only be used in cement industries because the calcium oxides generated in these factories can neutralise the sulphur emission.During a recent hearing in SC, a lawyer representing the Centre sought time to respond to EPCA 's submission. The apex court has given the Centre four weeks to examine whether pet coke and FO, if used as industrial fuel, is harmful.""In case the government comes to the conclusion that its use is indeed harmful, it may consider issuing appropriate directions in terms of Section 3(2)(v) of the Air Act,"" the order said.According to EPCA 's report, a big manufacturer of solar panels, a glass company and steel companies are using FO. Apart from PSUs, a private company also supplies FO./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Hair, sperm, libido: Delhi men on the losing side","NEW DELHI: At the end of 2016, there's bad news for Delhi men - they are losing their hair, sperm and libido.A new survey conducted by a city-based healthcare startup found that 63% of Delhi men (between the ages of 30-40) have a sperm count of less than 10 million/ml. That's half of the national average of 20 million/ml, according to a 2013 AIIMS report.The survey conducted by Dalmia Medicare analysed 1, 90,000 diagnostic tests carried out in the Delhi NCR region in 2016 to come up with these findings. ""When we started the study in January, the percentage of men with a low sperm count was 14%. By November, this had risen to 27%,"" says Dr Sunita Yadav, head quality, Dalmia Medicare. /Delhi men also fared poorly in their testosterone tests with 60% of those tested falling in the lower range -- below 300-350 (normal range is 300-1200ng/dl). Dr Yadav blamed stress, smoking, increased air pollution as some of the factors for this trend. Other scientific studies too have linked air pollution to poor quality of semen. A 2014 study done by researchers in China found that city-dwelling men had higher levels of abnormally shaped sperm, and with low motility, than their rural counterparts. The Delhi survey also found that 70% of men (average age 25) faced some kind of hair loss. Majority of them were found to be deficient in Vitamin B complex mainly B3 and B12. Smokers also had a high incidence of hair loss as compared to non-smokers since nicotine hampers blood flow and affects hair growth./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Pollution up, threatens to play party pooper","GURGAON: Pre-Christmas shopping rush, coupled with changing wind patterns, has pushed up the level of air pollution in the city alarmingly, threatening to choke the year-end revelry over the next week.According to data available with the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), Gurgaon witnessed a 45% increase in the average concentration of PM 2.5 and almost a 20-fold rise in the level of carbon monoxide (CO) on Friday.The highest average concentration of PM2.5 was reported to be 394.67 \xB5g/m3 in the day, as against 270.52 \xB5g/m3 on Thursday and 118.95 \xB5g/m3 on Wednesday.What came as a bigger shock was that the level of CO also was unusually high on Friday. Against a normal of 4 \xB5g/m3, the CO level went through the roof to touch 41.18 \xB5g/m3. The level of the pollutant, mainly generated by smoke-belching diesel-run vehicles, was only 1.97 \xB5g/m3 on Thursday and 3.75 \xB5g/m3 the day before.Further, after December 17, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in the city again touched 402 (severe or hazardous mark) on Friday. /It was well below 300-mark on Thursday and Wednesday.HSPCB officials claimed that citizens seemed to have swung into a party mood in view of the Christmas, as well as the weekend, triggering a massive rush and congestion on the city roads. ""The sudden rise in vehicular movement and snarls has increased the CO level. People are rushing to markets, office-goers have left their work place early to prepare for the parties on Saturday and Sunday, causing jams. The increase in the CO level can be linked directly to the spurt in vehicular pollution, especially caused by ones run on diesel,"" said an official of HSPCB.He added that the authorities concerned should immediately slam the brakes on diesel autos to rein in the pollution level.As far as the PM 2.5 level is concerned, the official said, the rise in toxic particles was due to the drop in the temperature. The Met office has forecast more polluted days in the run-up to the New Year. ""The temperature drops below 2 degrees Celsius in the city around this time of the year. However, this year, the mercury level is still hovering around the 4 degrees Celsius. And if PM2.5 is already crossing the 400 mark, it is a matter of serious concern. The temperature is expected to drop further in the first 10 days of January, entrapping more pollutants in the lower atmospheric level. Eventually, PM2.5 level will go up with the dip in the mercury mark,"" said a Met official.Some experts believe the burning of agricultural waste in neighbouring districts has also contributed to the city's rising air pollution levels. ""CO can travel long distances and stay in the atmosphere for more than a month. I think it is due to stubble burning, which happened in November in various parts of Punjab and Haryana, but the smoke is still gliding down to the city due to ever-changing wind patterns. The wind speed has increased from 0.21m/s on Wednesday to 0.79m/s on Friday, drawing in more pollution,"" said Sudhir Pandey, a retired Delhi University professor of environmental sciences.Dr Nirmala Singh, a city-based pulmonologist, said: ""The rise in the CO level can cause shortness of breath and obstruction in delivery of oxygen to organs.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Though many might wonder why she chose to do her internship here, for her, it turned out to be a better experience.She talks to TOI about various issues concerning environment, demonetisation and importance of research. /Q. How different is research here when compared to countries like France?A. In France, people are very individual and independent. Here, everything that we do - analysis, discussions, sampling - is done together in a team. This dependency is definitely bringing in more efficiency and interest, something that I wouldn't have got to experience in my native place. Young researchers here are better and government should extend huge financial support to them.Q. What are the major challenges the country faces? A. Negligence towards public health and environment is the most worrying issue for the country. Both go hand in hand. As environment is not being taken seriously, public health is getting adversely affected. Number of deaths due to air pollution in India is increasing at an alarming rate. A large number of people here are suffering from diseases like asthma, cancer, bronchitis and other respiratory problems.Q. Who is to be blamed for this?A. While it would be unfair to blame an individual or agency, mainly the government is at fault. We can see the results of its laxness in New Delhi. The warning signs were always there but the government waited for things to get worse.Q. What measures can developing cities like Nagpur take to avoid such problems?A. When it comes to air pollution, Nagpur might be better than cities like Delhi and Mumbai. But that doesn't mean we can sit back and relax. The situation is still bad. During ten minutes of walking from my home to the institute, I can feel my face all covered up in dust. The city is rich in green cover and the authorities should value and conserve that.Q. What are the major sources of air pollution here?A. In Nagpur, lack of public transport is a major reason. There are hardly any options, public buses are very few and in terrible condition. Most of the citizens commute through their personal two-wheelers and cars, which contributes significantly to air pollution. Other sources are thermal power plant and the large number of industries.Q. Why environmental laws are not being implemented in full force?A. If an industry is found violating environmental norms in France or other countries, it is shut down. Here, action-taking approach is missing. Just like in Delhi, Paris too went for odd even formula and it is still following it whenever pollution level is recorded high. Such steps should be continuous to get long-term solutions. Q. Your views on demonitisation.A. Just after four days I came here, the Prime Minister announced the big move. It came as a big shock as moves like banning currencies are unthinkable in our country. I would go to ATMs after midnight or early mornings. Though it is too early to judge the move, it will surely help in checking black money to some extent./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Hair, sperm, libido: Delhi men on the losing side","At the end of 2016, there's bad news for Delhi men - they are losing their hair, sperm and libido.A new survey conducted by a city-based healthcare startup found that 63% of Delhi men (between the ages of 30 and 40) have a sperm count of less than 10 million/ml. That's half of the national average of 20 million/ml, according to a 2013 AIIMS report. The survey conducted by Dalmia Medicare analysed 1,90,000 diagnostic tests carried out in Delhi-NCR in 2016 to come up with these findings. /""When we started the study in January, the percentage of men with a low sperm count was 14%. By November, this had risen to 27%,"" says Dr Sunita Yadav, head quality, Dalmia Medicare. Delhi men also fared poorly in their testosterone tests with 60% of those tested falling in the lower range - below 300-350 (normal range is 300-1200ng/dl). Dr Yadav blamed stress, smoking, increased air pollution as some of the factors for this trend. Other scientific studies too have linked air pollution to poor quality of semen. A 2014 study done by researchers in China found that city-dwelling men had higher levels of abnormally shaped sperm, and with low motility, than their rural counterparts. The Delhi survey also found that 70% of men (average age 25) faced some kind of hair loss. Majority of them were found to be deficient in Vitamin B complex, mainly B3 and B12. Smokers also had a high incidence of hair loss as compared to non-smokers since nicotine hampers blood flow and affects hair growth./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Farm residue can fire your cars, cut fuel import bill","NEW DELHI: The red patches in Nasa photos, indicating small fires dotting the plains of Punjab in early October, were plain enough. By early November, the patches got more intense, as blazing crop stubble and billowing smoke became a common sight in Punjab and even west UP. Shortly thereafter, alarm bells went off in Delhi as the pall of grey-white smoke drifted towards the city and its surrounding areas, choking residents who were already finding it difficult to breathe due to the particulate matter left hanging in the air by smoke-belching trucks and construction activities. /There might be some solution in sight as the biofuels industry now says fuel-grade ethanol could be a more valuable product from crop residue that, when burnt, not only causes air pollution but literally sends crores of rupees up in smoke. According to Pramod Chaudhari, executive chairman of Praj Industries, a leading biofuels technology provider, 250 litres of fuel grade bio-ethanol can be produced from a tonne of farm residue using second-generation processing technology. A step towards increasing biofuel availability will be taken when Pradhan and food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal lay the foundation stone on Sunday of the first bio-ethanol refinery at Bathinda in poll-bound Punjab. Alive to the issue, the government has asked state-run fuel retailers to set up bio-ethanol refineries. ""Second-generation ethanol production technology using rice-paddy straw in Punjab and Haryana will be a permanent solution to crop burning,"" oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said in a November 7 tweet. Estimates, including those by Nasa, pegged the quantity of farm residue burnt at 32 million tonnes in Punjab alone. This could mean some six billion litres of bio-ethanol. This can also translate into a big saving for the country, which meets 80% of its crude requirement through imports, since adequate availability of bio-ethanol will boost the government's plan to achieve 20% blending of petrol and diesel by 2021-22. That level of blending, a recent report by the Dehradun-based University of Petroleum and Energy Studies said, could save $6.12 billion in oil import bill. Besides producing bio-ethanol for the fuel blending programme, the new refineries will provide additional income for farmers, create jobs in rural areas and help air quality management./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Monday breaks haze spell but pollution remains high,"GURGAON: Compared to the grey Christmas, Monday was bright and sunny, but pollution continued to hover at levels dangerously higher than the national safe standard.According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the 24-hour average concentration of PM2.5 was 220.31 micrograms per cubic metre (\xB5g/m\xB3) on Monday, lower than 402.23\xB5g/m\xB3 on Sunday and 333.40\xB5g/m\xB3 on Saturday. However, air quality index (AQI) remained at nearly 200. The national safe standard for PM2.5 is 60 \xB5g/m\xB3.Experts requested authorities to ban diesel vehicles, especially autos, and close down polluting industries, stone crushers and brick kilns. ""We need to work on an immediate reaction mechanism when air pollution goes up. /For instance, temporary closure of highly polluting units, stone crushers and brick kilns, restricting entry of diesel vehicles for some time and ban on diesel vehicles, would keep the situation from deteriorating. This is done in Beijing, for example, when pollution becomes very high,"" said Niranjan Raje, former member of the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority.""Diesel autos are major culprits. They should at least be restricted during winter, when pollution is already high. Not only polluting industrial units, but stone crushers, brick kilns and construction sites should also be shut down for some time,"" said Jitender Bhadana of NGO Save Aravali.City-based environmental analyst Chetan Agarwal, however, said authorities should look for a permanent solution. ""In a year, 90% of the time, the city witnesses PM2.5 above the prescribed level. In winters, it gets worse due to the atmospheric condition. There is definitely a need to take concrete steps, like conversion of diesel autos into electric or CNG, as they are important means of transport for the poor,"" he said.Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) accepted the need to take permanent measures, but said the situation had improved on Monday. ""A dip in temperature led to rise in PM2.5 on Sunday. The situation improved on Monday due to better sunlight. We need to take permanent measures, like converting diesel autos into electric. Restricting entry of commercial diesel vehicles for a short while will not do. Polluting units, stone crushers and brick kilns can definitely be closed if the situation gets worse,"" said a HSPCB official./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Bengaluru's stifling problem: Greying air,"Bengaluru's air has become significantly more toxic, according to a recent study. Air quality measured in the city over an eight-year period in six locations revealed that while sulphur dioxide levels had decreased, airborne particulate matter have either been 'high' or 'critical' in most areas.The research project selected industrial, commercial, residential and sensitive areas of the city, including Graphite India Ltd, Whitefield Road; KHB Industrial Area, Yelahanka; Peenya Industrial area, Regional Office Peenya; Victoria Hospital, Chamrajpet; AMCO Batteries, Mysore Road; and Yeshwanthpur Police Station (YPR).The eight-year trend analysis between 2006 and 2013, showed that the overall percentage increase in airborne particulate matter was 216 per cent in KHB, 161.2 per cent in AMCO, 119.3 per cent in Victoria Hospital, 80.3 per cent at YPR, 76.5 per cent at Graphite India, and 17.5 per cent in Peenya.MORE VEHICLES, MORE POLLUTION The main source of pollution in the city is the. It contributes to almost 50 per cent of the pollution. The other contributors are construction activities, paved and unpaved road dust, domestic pollution and the increased use of diesel generator sets, said experts.Anitha Chinnaswamy, lead researcher from Coventry University, UK, said in her findings: ""All six areas have varying levels of PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometres or less in diameter), with pollution classifications as mainly high or critical. /Across all areas, the concentration level of PM10 in 2013 was critical. Overall, four air pollutants, namely sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, suspended particulate matter and respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM/PM10), were monitored at all locations.""""Based on data obtained from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) for eight years, the paper critically analysed the trend of pollutants identified by the six air quality monitoring stations managed by KSPCB, within their respective areas of coverage and, based on that analysis, alert both researchers and local authorities to the necessity of overcoming the limitations of insufficient monitoring,"" she said.Her previous research project, taking Bengaluru as a case study, had for the first time established a link between deaths due to cardiovascular diseases and high levels of particulate matter that are 10 micrometres or less in diameter, referred to as 'PM10.""In general, particulate matter causes a wide range of diseases and its presence is said to be more dangerous to human health than any other common air pollutant,"" she added.HEALTH RISKSThe current paper says that the three industrial areas varied in air quality classification from moderate to critical, with KHB industrial area generally having fluctuating levels of pollution.In 2013, the level of PM10 in KHB was at its highest - an alarming 182 micrograms per cubic metre (\xB5g/m3) - across the eight years under consideration. (The World Health Organisation [WHO] safe limit for annual mean of PM10 levels is 20 \xB5g/m3. A WHO report earlier this year had showed that PM10 level for Bengaluru was 118 \xB5g/m3.)The levels found at Graphite industrial area were also alarmingly high, revealed the analysis. The PM10 values of 194 \xB5g/m3 in 2007, and 184 \xB5g/m3 in 2009, were over three times above the acceptable limit.The level in 2013 stood at 162 \xB5g/m3, which was 2.7 times the acceptable limit.Victoria Hospital consistently maintained a high level of PM10 pollution, from 2006 to 2012. However, in 2013 this level shot up to 152 \xB5g/m3, three times that of the previous year and over 2.5 times the safe limit set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the researchers observed.""The same observation applies to the two residential areas of Yeshwanthpur (YPR) and AMCO, where there was a respective significant increase in concentration in 2013, in comparison with the seven previous years,"" said the multi-national research team.""For Bengaluru, the critical levels of PM are likely to have a damaging effect on the health of the citizens that may result in a tremendous burden on the public health system. Additionally, if this were to affect the skilled young human resource, it would pose a threat to the city's economy. Therefore, it is of vital importance that the government addresses the issue of health impact due to air pollution by adhering to stringent measures of pollutants' control,"" the researchers said.OTHER POLLUTANTSAccording to the researchers, the sources of, applicable to the city, are mainly due to the burning of fossil fuels and diesel exhaust, and the health effects attributable to it are known to be inflammation of the respiratory tract, lung damage, and irritation in the eyes, mucous membranes and the skin.Their analysis showed that generally the levels of sulphur dioxide tended to decrease in these areas.""Since fuel type and quality are one of the major contributors to sulphur dioxide, the overall decreasing trend may be attributed to various regulatory measures taken, such as the reduction of sulphur in diesel fuel and the wider use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), instead of coal, as domestic fuel,"" said Chinnaswamy.The researchers analysed levels of nitrogen oxide, exposure to which, according to experts, is linked to adverse respiratory effects and airway inflammation in healthy people, and increased respiratory symptoms in people with asthma.Assessment shows that in both YPR and AMCO residential areas, nitrogen oxide concentration levels over the year 2009 were at their highest, with a moderate air pollution classification.However, over the subsequent years to 2013, there was a consistent decrease in nitrogen oxide pollution and, its concentration levels decreased by 24.4 per cent and 23.8 per cent in YPR and AMCO, respectively.""Industrial areas of KHB, Graphite and Peenya saw similar peaks in its concentration levels in 2009 (except for Graphite, where the highest level of 50.7\xB5g/m3 was reached in 2006) before assuming a generally downward trend. In Victoria too, there was a similar pattern, with 2009 marking a peak value, followed by a downward trend,"" said the findings.The researchers said a possible explanation for the universal increased nitrogen oxide concentration level in 2009 may be attributed to the increase in the number of cars. ""Although the number of vehicles (whether registered or not) has been generally increasing in Bengaluru, the number of registered vehicles, particularly over 2007-09, saw an exponential increase of over half a million additional vehicles. As motor vehicle exhaust emissions are one of the major contributors to nitrogen oxide dispersion, this noticeable increase in vehicular traffic could have contributed to the significant increase in levels in 2009,"" they added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Cooking emissions an overlooked contributor to air pollution,"KOLKATA: The skyline on this part of the country turns grey by afternoon. By dusk, a thick layer of smog envelops the horizon. With winter setting in, millions living in rural and suburban India has many reasons to worry about, one of it being air pollution. The surroundings suffer from choking smog and acrid smell in the air, most of which are the result of smoke from chulhas and conventional cook stoves used by millions at their homes. /While climatic conditions are contributors to bad air quality, man-made pollution is also a huge contributor across the country.India is suffocating through an air pollution emergency. The alarming rise in air pollution levels across India, especially during winter, can be attributed to increase in industrial chimney waste, thermal power stations, burning of farms and vehicular emission. However, the effect of air pollution is different in Eastern India as compared to the rest of the country, where millions still depend on coal-based heating and cooking medium.With multiple cities far from reaching the minimum air quality standards recommended by the World Health Organization, traffic is being forcibly reduced, construction projects are put on hold, in order to combat the crisis. Yet one of the pollution crisis's major contributors, emissions from cooking, has not made headlines as other pollution sources have. Over 85% of Indian rural households use biomass as cooking fuel, according to reports. Biomass burning not only causes indoor pollution but destroys a key resource for soil rejuvenation.According to The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), nearly 40% of India's air pollution comes from domestic fuel burning. For decades, researchers, experts and NGOs have looked for ways of convincing people to switch to more efficient and cost effective cooking methods. When people cook on traditional chulhas, large amounts of toxic smoke and soot escape into the air. These emissions, which can cause cancer, pneumonia, heart disease etc, are a major contributor to outdoor air pollution.In addition to air pollution, burning solid fuels releases emissions of some of the most important contributors to global climate change: carbon dioxide, methane, black carbon, and other short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). Unsustainable wood harvesting also contributes to deforestation, reducing carbon uptake by forests.Earlier this year, an online database established with support from the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, an initiative by the United Nation Foundation, began tracking the impact of household energy consumption on more than 640 districts across India. The data showed that almost 30% of the country's outdoor air pollution is due to household energy combustion. In some districts, household air pollution contributes over half of outdoor air pollution, making it clear that reducing outdoor air pollution requires addressing indoor air pollution as well.The government has announced plans to connect 50 million households below the poverty line to cooking gas by 2019. Thus far, nearly 14 million households have already been given connections to cooking gas. Multiple partners of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves have engaged with the ministry of health and family welfare, in collaboration with UNICEF and WHO, to develop a strategy for including clean cooking as part of India's integrated Action Plan for Prevention of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea.""We know the health impacts of cooking in India, where far too many people still cook with heavily polluting fuels,"" says Damodar Bachani, deputy commissioner at the ministry of health and family welfare, adding, ""The ministry, in collaboration with multiple stakeholders, is helping to mitigate the impact of air pollution on health. One of the proven solutions is increasing the use of safer, cleaner fuels and stoves for cooking.""""Household air pollution from cooking is a leading cause of illness and death in India. Switching millions of people from cooking with solid fuels to consistent use of clean fuels could deliver huge benefits to health and the environment, especially air quality,"" said Radha Muthiah, CEO of GACC./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
