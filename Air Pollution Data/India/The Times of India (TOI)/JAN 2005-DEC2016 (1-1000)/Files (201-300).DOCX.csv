Drive to rein in polluting vehicles,"ALLAHABAD: In a move to regulate traffic and bring down the rising air pollution levels, the traffic police on Monday launched a drive against vehicles emitting poisonous carbon mono-oxide beyond the stipulated limits./Traffic inspector Indrapal Singh told TOI that four teams equipped with smoke meters and gas analysers have been deputed at static locations of the city to check air pollution by vehicles. He further added that the drive was launched on the directives of the DGP and teams would be checking cases of air pollution by vehicles from August 12 to 19, 2013./Before this drive, a similar drive was held from July 17 to July 26 wherein as many as 1,066 vehicles were checked and 278 of them were challaned. The traffic police had realized Rs 34,000 in fine. The traffic inspector said, ""We have primarily been targeting three wheelers and heavy vehicles violating the norms.""/While environmentalists term carbon monoxide as a slow poison, Dr Anil Kumar, a physician said, ""Excessive inhalation of carbon monoxide restricts oxygen intake. It also affects the lungs' capacity and results in diseases like bronchitis, asthma, fibrosis and other respiratory ailments.""/A senior cop said that the nature and extent of pollutants being emitted by heavy vehicles, as well as tempos, will be minutely gauged during the campaign and drivers would also be briefed about the ill-effects of smoke emitted by vehicles. tnn/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Take green report seriously, NGO tells civic body","PUNE: City-based NGO Parisar has urged the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to take the annual Environment Status Report (ESR) seriously and make allocations in next year's budget to curb air, water and noise pollutions./In a statement issued after analyzing the ESR for 2012-13 recently released by the PMC, the NGO stated, ""The ESR has once again highlighted the fact that personal vehicles continue to increase at an explosive rate, indicating the failure of the PMC to implement its own comprehensive mobility plan (CMP). The resultant higher than danger levels of NOx, PM10 and PM2.5 is badly affecting the health of citizens. Unfortunately, the PMC has not reported the occurrence of respiratory diseases in the city.""/The NGO said that the RTO numbers mentioned in the ESR show that 400 two-wheelers and 127 cars are added to the streets of Pune per day. The annual growth rate of two-wheelers last year was 8.6% with cars growing at an astounding 14%. As per the census, the population of Pune increases by 2% per year./Parisar said there was lack of data regarding air pollution in the report, as only three locations in the entire city were mentioned. Measuring PM2.5 levels are especially important as they are most harmful to health due to the ability of very small particles to go deep inside our lungs, the NGO stated./Parisar has urged the PMC to allocate more resources to set up monitoring stations and develop a system by which this information can be conveyed to the public in an easy-to-understand manner on a regular basis./""While citing the CMP, the ESR has once again failed to report on the metrics, such as accidents per lakh population, network speed, buses per lakh population etc., which could be used to determine if the goals set in the CMP are being achieved,"" Parisar stated./The NGO said the ESR recommends creating more parking spaces as a solution, whereas it is a known fact that providing more and low-cost parking facilities will only increase the tendency of people to use their own vehicles, thereby creating more pollution. Most of the other recommendations of the CMP, which have been stressed in the ESR, continue to be ignored by the PMC, the NGO alleged./""While the PMC has failed to launch the 'share-a-bicycle scheme', we hope that the PMPML's business plan, the comprehensive bicycle plan and the street design guidelines being prepared by the PMC will improve the conditions in future,"" the NGO's press statement added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Traffic cops reluctant to wear face mask,"KANPUR: Traffic department’s bid to protect its constables from pollution has failed. Most of the cops have rejected the pollution-mask describing them as uncomfortable and a hurdle in blowing whistle while managing the traffic./Realising that cops were exposed to high level of pollution during duty hours, the traffic department had decided to provide masks to those deployed at prominent crossings of the city./The Merchants Chamber had recently provided 300 masks to the department. These masks were provided to each and every traffic constable especially those handling traffic at Bada Chauraha, Tat Mill Chauraha, Narhona Crossing, Meghdoot Crossing and Rawatpur Crossing to name a few./Though the traffic cops know that these masks would protect them from severe health hazards like respiratory infections, heart disease, and lung cancer, they are not keen in wearing the same./“Sometimes, it is difficult to breathe through the mask. They are usually not good and make us feel uncomfortable. So, you hardly see any policemen wearing these masks,"" said a traffic cop./Another traffic constable said that mask’s belt was extremely tight and could not be worn through out the day. He also said “we have to take off the mask to whistle while controlling traffic which is a cause of inconvenience.”/The traffic cops also admitted that they often suffer from respiratory and skin-related problems and have hardly any solution to them. Health experts, however, said that traffic cops were exposed to toxic exhaust for long hours which posed a threat to their lungs./The experts further added that smoke of the vehicles, high decibel sound of horns and dust was a source of strain for the cops./Air pollution leads to respiratory problem, wheezing, coughing, asthma and aggravation of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions. These effects can result in increased medication use, increased doctor or emergency room visits and premature death./Rakesh Kumar Nayak, CO traffic department said “wearing mask is not mandatory. It has been given to cops for trial. If they are facing inconvenience, they should report it.”/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Ways to keep that flu at bay,"Seasonal change has increased the chances of catching a quick cold and cough to fungal infections. Viral fever, being the most common of all; almost every second person you talk to these days either has just got over or is having a viral fever./Monsoons call for a lot of care; here are a few ways to tackle or rather stay away from severe viral fever this season, as it drains you out completely. We give you a few tips to keep that flue at bay./The germs of viral fever travel in the air, which makes them even more obvious to contract. Monsoons make our body vulnerable and also trigger the spread of disease carrying germs in the air, says Dr. Sameer Kapadia, Mumbai based radiologist and general physician from Opera House. “The season beings in viral fevers since immunity goes down with the dampness and moisture in the air, pollution, rampant abuse of antibiotics without doctors being informed, etc.,” says Kapadia. “The best way to prevent viral fevers is to maintain high standards of hygiene, not eat roadside food or keep food outside for a long time after cutting them,” added Kapadia. Nayantara Singhdeo, Parel resident says that viral affected almost every single member of their family, including their domestic help. “First my son came home from school with a running nose, followed by my ever vulnerable daughter, who falls sick at the drop of a hat, due to low immunity levels. My husband suffered the most due to an excruciating body pain and headache. He couldn’t attend office for about a week,” said Singhdeo./While alternative medicine specialist Dr. BV Khare, Dadar, surgeon and urologist, also practicing acupuncture and acupressure all across the world says that virals cannot be prevented this season. The change climate conditions help the spread of these germs. “However, alternative medicine is one of the best remedies; Sujok (pressure points on hands and legs) helps cure viral fevers, cold, cough and body pain in a faster manner./Dripping nose stops in like 15 minutes; while patients who come to me with high fever are cured within a day or two. Alternative medicine can sure these ailments in no time and does not involve any medication life heavy antibiotics; it’s just a treatment that focuses on the relevant pressure points and cures them through magneto therapy on hand,” says Khare./While Malini Shah, a clinical psychologist mentioned that more than anything else, virals are extremely contagious. “Although virals are contagious; a lot of people contract viral fevers from family members because they are always thinking about it. After seeing your mom suffers from severe fever and cough for two days; you too start feeling sick; body aches especially at the limbs is very common. Virals need to be treated with the right medication; otherwise it is ought to spread,” mentioned Shah./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Incense smoke can choke asthma patients,"BANGALORE: That divine aroma emanating from the corners of your home can cause havoc for asthma patients. The good old agarbatti, once a part of every Indian home, is known to cause indoor pollution./Pulmonologists in the city are reporting patients with respiratory disorders complaining of discomfort after inhaling agarbatti smoke./A recent study by Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina, at Chapel, found that burning incense gives rise to indoor air pollution that causes lung cell inflammation and other health problems./Researchers had tested incense sticks in the UAE, though no study was conducted on Indian incense sticks. Though the components of incense sticks in the UAE and India are completely different, there are cases where agarbatti smoke has infected the lungs of many patients with underlying asthmatic and other lung disorders./Indian agarbatti manufacturers, however, have debunked the study and say they use natural ingredients like camphor, clove, sandalwood and kasturi along with medicinal herbal ingredients. ""A study was conducted on incense sticks used in West Asian countries and not on Indian sticks. There is confusion because both are called incense sticks. In the UAE, the practice is to ignite charcoal briquettes approximately the size of a carrom coin. Fragrant resins such as 'bhakoor' and 'oud' are sprinkled on the embers, which produce heavy fragrant smoke that spreads through the air. One incense stick of the UAE is equal to 100 Indian agarbatti sticks. The ingredients are different and we don't use charcoal,"" says Saptagiri S Boggaram, president of the All India Agarabatti Manufacturers./Dr Vivek Padegal, pulmonologist from Fortis Hospital, says people with allergies and asthma are affected by the perfume and smoke from agarbattis. ""Pre-existing conditions like asthma can trigger lung infections if the person is exposed to this smoke,"" said Dr Padegal. ""It's good to have cross ventilation when incense sticks are lit at home. The smoke must spread and get exchanged with fresh air,"" the doctor said./Dr Padma Sundaram, consultant pulmonogist at Manipal Hospitals, agrees. ""Agarbatti smoke is known to irritate the mucus membrane, eyes and respiratory system, and can aggravate matters for asthma patients. For chain smokers, it can cause harm with more sputum production,"" she said./Doctors say the biggest lacuna is the lack of a yardstick and mechanism to measure indoor air pollution, like the way the government tests air quality outdoors./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Indian lungs are weaker, rescue them!","Indian lungs are 30% weaker than those in the West, and Mumbai’s pollution doesn’t help. Here’s how you can rescue them/Before the show at the multiplex begins, the sight of two hands wringing liquid tar out of a sponge makes you queasy. You are told that’s what cigarette smoking does to your squishy pink pair of lungs. You feel better because you don’t smoke, or you can ‘control’. But it turns out you don’t need to puff on cancer sticks to paint your lungs black. In a study conducted across five cities on 10,000 healthy, non-smoking individuals, Pune’s Chest Research Foundation has found that we Indians have 30 per cent lower lung function as compared to Europeans, and air pollution is the villain./Lung stung/Our lungs literally introduce life into our system, with each of the 22,000 breaths we take in a day, pumping oxygen in, throwing carbon dioxide out, nourishing every cell of our bodies. Our lungs are so wellequipped that they can easily last us a lifetime if we don’t them to hell. “But once they are damaged, it’s a downhill course from there,” says Dr Sundeep Salvi, who along with Dr Rahul Kodgule, helmed the study./The lung strength of 10,000 individuals across Pune, Jaipur, Kolkata, Srinagar and Hyderabad, was assessed by measuring the Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (the rate at which a person exhales). Women had 30 per cent lower PEF values than men. “Such poor lung strength makes us susceptible to chronic lung diseases such as asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Caused by air pollution or smoking, COPD happens to be the leading cause of death in Maharashtra, and in India, it’s second only to heart disease,” says Salvi. This study perhaps corroborates what Canadian researchers had already found in an international study across 17 countries — Indians’ lungs were the worst off./Dr Pralhad Prabhudesai, Consultant Chest Physician, Lilavati Hospital, says the city has witnessed a sharp spike in respiratory illnesses. “Not just the elderly and young adults, but children too have been increasingly getting respiratory problems related to viral infections and allergies. The trick is to not turn to antibiotics, because they will only worsen the condition. Instead, bronchodilators for COPD, and inhaled steroids for asthma, work well.”/Air concerns/Prabhudesai holds the city’s ridiculously high air pollution responsible for ruining Mumbaikars’ lungs. “Mumbai is choking with rampant construction and debilitating traffic jams. The resultant dust, Carbon Monoxide (CO), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), sulphur dioxide and suspended particulate matter wreak havoc on our lungs. This is why healthy, nonsmoking individuals are getting bronchitis and emphysema. The government must figure ways to provide us clean air,” he says./Salvi seconds him. “For instance, we can’t stop new vehicles hitting the road but we can set a quality standard for vehicles to regulate emissions. Trees are terrific at absorbing vehicular smoke. With CO2 and CO being nutrients for trees, it’s a give-and-take solution. Neem and Gulmohar are especially efficient in absorbing suspended particulate matter.”/Breathe right/You must consciously give up on shallow breathing. Deep belly breathing boosts lung strength. But if you want to do more, do what your favourite singer would do. Practising a technique like diaphragmatic breathing ups your lung capacity. It works by focussing on lowering the diaphragm (the muscle that separates the organs in the abdomen from the lungs) as you breathe in. Correcting your walking and sitting postures helps, and so does regularly having a good belly laugh. “If you can climb two flights of stairs without feeling short of breath, your lungs are in good shape,” says Salvi./Smoking is worse/The prime cause of lung ailments like lung cancer and COPD, smoking has no safe threshold. “Second-hand or third-hand smoke is just as bad,” says Prabhudesai. Smoking destroys your lungs’ natural cleaning and repair apparatus, trapping cancercausing chemicals in them. Smoking also paralyses cilia, the fine hairs that line the airways of the lungs and push toxins out of your lungs. “Smokers’ lungs degenerate at twice the rate of a non-smoker,” says Salvi./Food wise/Antioxidant-rich foods have been proven to enhance lung function. Make space in your plate for cruciferous veggies like cabbage, broccoli, cabbage and bok choy, green leafy ones, and all kinds of fruits. Omega-3 fatty acids are friends of the lungs too — so include more fish and walnuts in your diet. “You can’t stress enough on drinking more water, because good hydration keeps the airway mucus moist and hence clear of irritation,” says Prabhudesai./Powering your lungs/Since you need to do more to push your lungs to their fullest capacity, give them a tough time. Working out, running or cycling will work wonders, but Salvi recommends swimming over them all. “Swimming gives your lungs the ideal workout. Also, if you cycle or run in an open space that has high vehicular pollution, you are harming your lungs because by breathing faster, you are inhaling a higher volume of pollutants. Try and find greener pockets cut off from vehicular madness,” he says./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Countries to adopt 10 targets to combat non-communicable diseases,"MUMBAI: Health ministers from 11 South-East Asian countries are expected to adopt 10 targets to prevent and control non-communicable diseases by 2025./An estimated 7.9 million lives, 55% of all deaths in the region, are lost every year due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) making it the biggest killer in WHO's South-East Asia Region. Four major NCDs - cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, cancers and diabetes together kill the largest number of people in the region. These NCDs share four behavioural risk factors: tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol. The health ministers will meet at the sixty-sixth Ssession of the WHO Regional Committee for South-East Asia in New Delhi./The increase in NCDs is attributed to factors such as population ageing, rapid and unplanned urbanization, negative effects of globalization (such as trade and irresponsible marketing of unhealthy products), low literacy, and poverty./""Non-communicable diseases exact a huge toll on national economies. NCDs disproportionately affect poor, impoverished families and are a growing burden on health systems,"" said Dr Samlee Plianbangchang, WHO Rregional director for South-East Asia. ""These 10 targets are ambitious goals and they demonstrate that governments are serious about reducing the disease burden from NCDs,"" he added./The macroeconomic impact of NCDs is profound, resulting in loss of productivity and gross domestic product. Due to long-term treatment costs and high out-of-pocket costs, NCDs can result in catastrophic health expenditures and impoverishment. In India, for example, the share of out-of-pocket expenditure due to NCDs increased from 32% in 1995 to 47% in 2004; of this NCD-related expenditure, 40% was financed by household borrowing and sale of assets. In Thailand, the economic burden of the harmful use of alcohol was estimated to be equivalent to 2% of the gross domestic product in 2006. According to a recent analysis by Harvard School of Public Health, the cumulative economic loss due to the four major NCDs in India for 2012 - 2030 is estimated as 3.9 trillion dollars./The United Nations General Assembly galvanized global momentum and commitment to address NCDs at a high-level meeting in 2011. In May 2013 the World Health Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution endorsing the Global Action Plan for Prevention and Control of NCDs. The global action plan covers the period 2013-2020. The Assembly also adopted the global monitoring framework and a set of nine voluntary global targets. At the WHO Regional Committee Meeting, countries of the South-East Asian Region are expected to endorse all nine global targets. The region is also endorsing a tenth target to address household air pollution which remains a neglected issue especially affecting poor rural women. The target calls for a 50% reduction in households using solid fuels like wood, crop residue, dried dung, coal and charcoal, as the primary cooking source./Household air pollution (HAP), also known as indoor air pollution is a major contributor to death due to lower respiratory tract infections in children and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults. Other adverse effects of HAP include tuberculosis, cataracts, cerebrovascular diseases and poor maternal outcomes including still birth. An estimated 3.5 million deaths in 2010 were attributed to household air pollution globally. According to WHO estimates, while 50% of the global population uses solid fuels for their energy needs, 61% of households in the Region use solid fuels, which is second only to Africa at 77%. Household air pollution is largely a problem of poverty and lack of access to clean fuels. Therefore it requires committed actions by multiple sectors including the governments, industry, NGOs and the private sector./The Regional Committee is expected to adopt a Regional Action Plan for Prevention and Control of NCDs. The action plan is intended to provide a roadmap of actions for developing and implementing policies and programmes to reduce the burden of NCDs. It also provides a roadmap to achieve a 25% reduction in deaths from cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, or chronic respiratory diseases by 2025. Implementation of the plan will be monitored through a set of indicators which are consistent with the global monitoring framework. Reports on progress in implementing the action plan will be submitted to the WHO Regional Committee sessions in 2016, 2018 and 2021./10 targets to be achieved by 2025/1. 25% relative reduction in overall mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, or chronic respiratory diseases./2. 10% relative reduction in the harmful use of alcohol./3. 30% relative reduction in prevalence of current tobacco use in persons aged over 15 years./4. 10% relative reduction in prevalence of insufficient physical activity./5. 30% relative reduction in mean population intake of salt/sodium./6. 25% reduction in prevalence of raised blood pressure./7. Halting the rise in obesity and diabetes./8. 50% of eligible people receive drug therapy and counselling (including glycaemic control) to prevent heart attacks and strokes./9. 80% availability of affordable basic technologies and essential medicines, including generics, required to treat major NCDs in both public and private facilities./10. 50% relative reduction in the proportion of households using solid fuels as the primary cooking source./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
One-man panel to probe charges of pollution by VPT,"VISAKHAPATNAM: The Lokayukta has appointed a one-man commission to look into the allegations of pollution being caused by the Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) in One Town area. The commission will submit its report before December 24 after visiting the city, said Dr Shireen Rahman, president, Chaitanya Sravanthi, a voluntary organization./According to her, the commission was appointed following Chaitanya Sravanthi's sustained agitation against pollution by VPT. ""We filed a petition with the Lokayukta on May 8 against VPT. The Lokayukta appointed a one-man commission after neither the VPT management nor AP Pollution Control Board officials turned up for the hearing on June 13,"" she said./""Scores of people are dying because of the pollution caused by VPT and many others are suffering from various lung diseases. Because of port pollution, around 60 people have died last year alone and hundreds of locals have developed various ailments,"" she alleged./According to Rahman, the VPT has failed to take proper measures to control pollution levels despite scores of representations and agitations by locals. ""As per the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, 60 micro grams per metre cube of pollution is permissible in the air. But the levels in One Town area hover between an alarming 80 to 110 and have only been increasing year by year. VPT has been showing false statistics,"" Dr Rehman alleged./""VPT has been saying that it has been sprinkling the water in the port area to avoid dust particles from spreading in the area. The port has even been misleading the Union environment ministry by giving assurances that it will plant 4.3 lakh saplings in the next five years. But so far, it has not planted even one lakh saplings,"" she alleged./She warned the port management that if they did not take any measures to control pollution levels, her organization would intensify its agitations. Chaitanya Sravanti took the help of AU civil engineering department's environmental engineering faculty Prof Dr S Bala Prasad in measuring the air pollution levels in select areas of One Town and submitted the report to the Lokayukta, she added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Toxic cocktail choking Kolkata's traffic cops,"KOLKATA: Traffic constable A K Mondal, who does duty at Kidderpore-AJC Bose Road intersection, coughs frequently. Climbing a flight of stairs leaves him breathless. Occasionally, he gets restless at night. Though he has not consulted a doctor yet, these might be early symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a malfunction of lungs that turns crippling with advancing age./Mondal is a member of the 2,200-strong constabulary force at Kolkata traffic police that is extremely vulnerable to COPD. Inhaling a toxic cocktail of emissions for up to eight hours a day, their lungs are choked with pollutants, drastically reducing their capacity to function. A health check-up conducted by two hospitals on a section of the force revealed that 7 out of 10 suffer from lungs disorder./""The results of the check-up is alarming. Around 400 constables have undergone tests so far and lungs-related problems were detected in around 300 of them. In addition, many have bronchial and heart problems as well as diabetes. Though the lungs aren't majorly impaired at present, the constables run a high risk of developing COPD,"" said Tapas Das, chief manager of hospital services at Desun./DC (traffic) Dilip Adak acknowledged that some constables had been detected with bronchial and lungs problem. ""They have to stand on the road and are exposed to automobile emission and dust pollution,"" he said, adding that efforts would be made to minimize the health hazard./However, the force does not have any plan of action yet. In fact, Kolkata Police should have addressed the matter a decade ago when the findings of Twisha Lahiri of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute had sounded the alarm bell on air pollution affecting the lungs of traffic cops. Wearing anti-pollution masks should have been made mandatory for constables, much as helmets are for those who ride two-wheelers./Lahiri's report was not acted upon./A decade on, another report has again raised the alarm the force is still thinking of giving out masks to traffic constables along with special shoes that make standing for long hours more comfortable, said a senior police officer. How long it will take for the thoughts to translate into action is anybody's guess./Home guard Raju Das, who is posted at Esplanade, has to stand at an extremely busy intersection where traffic density is extremely high. ""At times, pollution and dust make breathing difficult. Not only is my face layered with soot, when I spit the phlegm is dark gray. I suffer from persistent cough,"" he said./Pulmonary specialist Amitava Saha says these are symptoms of COPD. ""These are very early signs but unmistakable. As traffic constables are exposed to pollution, it is apparent that they will suffer from lungs and bronchial problems,"" said Saha./A person suffering from lungs disorder encounters a choking sensation in sleep, feels palpitations at the slightest pressure and gets irritated very easily. What's even more frightful is that once a person suffers from COPD, he or she is done for life. ""There is no cure yet for COPD. If proper medication is administered at the very initial stage, it can be stalled. But it can cripple a person at a later stage,"" Saha explained./The fate of constables in other cities isn't as bad as those of Kolkata though emission is a pollutant everywhere. In Delhi, where more vehicles ply than in Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai put together, cops suffer from respiratory and heart diseases, cancer, musculoskeletal and neurological disorders. But Delhi Police conducts regular checks and if a person is found to suffer from a serious disease, he is taken off duty and treated. ""We have also asked constables to wear air filter masks on duty and are exploring all kinds of anti-pollution gadgets available in the market to enhance safety,"" Delhi Police special commissioner (traffic) Taj Hassan said./In Mumbai, the force is creating a health profile of the 3,000-odd constables at 25 traffic guards. ""We have found that a considerable number of traffic personnel suffer from sleep apnea, a sleep disorder caused by anxiety. They have also been detected with hypertension and diabetes,"" He, however, pointed out that efforts to hand out masks to constables had not been encouraging as the cops did not use the gadget./""We have kept oxygen cylinders at the chowkis so that constables could take in fresh air after duty. But particulate matter remains a concern,"" said Mumbai Police joint commissioner (traffic) Vivek Phansalkar./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Capital’s air quality monitoring best,"NEW DELHI: Bus ridership in Delhi has dropped from 60% in 2000 to 41% now. Every year, Delhi needs an area the size of 310 football fields for parking its vehicles. And Delhi has one of the highest particulate matter (PM10) levels in South Asia./These are some of the findings of a recent Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) assessment of air pollution and policies of different cities in dealing with it. That gives you a comprehensive picture of the growing vehicular population and the resultant pollution. However, bus ridership may have been affected by the switch to Metro./But it’s not all gloomy. Delhi has the most robust, real-time air quality monitoring system which in many ways is far ahead of other cities./The city has the largest capacity for continuous monitoring and reporting of tiny particles of less than 10 micron size (PM10) and less than 2.5 micron size (PM2.5), nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), ammonia and air toxics, including benzene, xylene and toluene. It also reports data on toxics like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), lead and nickel. It also provides historical data for the previous seven days with meteorological data, including wind speed and direction, ambient temperature, humidity and solar radiation. This helps both people and scientists keep track of everyday air pollution./CSE has also commended Delhi for reversing the cap on the number of auto-rickshaws. The Delhi government has managed to put auto-rickshaws on a GPS tracking system (still in the process) and the drivers are being issued smart cards for proper enforcement. Recently, the city prepared street design guidelines which incorporate vending zones, three-wheeler stops, road furniture and pedestrian-oriented lighting. The assessment was released at a day-long discussion on Thursday with stakeholders and environment department representatives from across the country./Sanjiv Kumar, environment secretary, Delhi, who made a brief presentation on Delhi’s policies, said that the pollution problem in the capital cannot be tackled just by taking steps in Delhi. “Delhi is also bearing the impact of pollution from sources outside Delhi in NCR,” he said./Sanjiv Kumar said Delhi government’s department of health is working on guidelines to brief people about the health impact of air pollution. “We are struggling with enforcement issues as a lot of non-commercial vehicles are entering Delhi from Gurgaon which also adds to air pollution,” he said./CSE executive director Sunita Narain said it’s time that India is considered as one air shed. “Its time all cities and towns across India had Euro 4 fuel norms. Smoke plumes and wind factors affect the entire country. Why should some cities have clean fuel while others don’t?” she asked./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Only two Kerala towns in India meet clean air benchmark,"NEW DELHI: At a time when most Indian cities and towns show pollutants in the air due to emissions from different sources, two towns in Kerala – Malappuram and Pathanamthitta – have met the clean air benchmark of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)./The finding is part of a book -- Good News Bad News: Clearing the Air in Indian Cities – brought out by Delhi-based research and advocacy organization Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), after making detailed assessment of 227 cities/towns of India on how they fare on parameters such as air quality, public transport, walk-ability, parking policies and fiscal initiatives./The qualitative and quantitative assessment of air pollution level is based on survey in these cities/towns which are part of the air pollution monitoring grid of the CPCB of Union the ministry of environment and forest./It was found during the assessment that there are very few cities\towns, which can be termed clean keeping PM10 levels (respirable particulates) as criteria. As far as other parameters are concerned, while SO2 levels have fallen sharply in many cities over the years, the NO2 levels have constantly been increasing in many cities./Put together by the CSE’s air pollution and sustainable urbanization experts, the book has come out with other startling facts. It said 78% of these cities\towns have particulate pollution levels that exceed the acceptable standards./It also found that the bus transport ridership is declining in Delhi. On positive side, large numbers of people walk and cycle in Indian cities. Delhi has the highest number of cycle trips whereas Mumbai has the highest number of walk trips./Referring to parking requirement of vehicles in cities, the book points out, "" Delhi needs an area the size of 310 football fields for parking its vehicles. Chennai needs space equivalent to 100 such fields, Chandigarh 58 and Bhubaneswar 30”./Highlighting these facts, director general of the CSE Sunita Narain said, ""India needs over Rs 3,00,000 crore to refurbish and renovate its transport network. Governments are expected to foot half the bill. But, can they do it?”/She said, ""Air pollution has become the fifth largest killer, and the seventh biggest illness burden in India as per the Global Burden of Disease report, released in 2013. This book comes at a critical moment in the ‘life-cycle’ of Indian cities – it helps us understand how cities are moving ahead or stalling their progress, and what could be a possible roadmap for progress”./The book was released here by Harish Salve, senior advocate of Supreme Court and the amicus curiae on various environment-related cases on Thursday./The CSE assessment has reviewed practices across the world, and finds that cities worldwide have started to take action to reverse the trend in travel choices./The assessment finds that the ""action in mega and big metros is more layered, diverse and extensive. This is partly because of the attention they have, investments they have drawn, and strident and aggressive public opinion and media pressure. Initiatives in smaller cities are often singular or limited in scope but with strong potential.”/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Too many trucks eating into Delhi's roads,"NEW DELHI: As you wait to pass the toll gates at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border near Ghaziabad, the long line of trucks waiting to get entry is visible from miles away. Most are on their way to other parts of the country, via Delhi./According to estimates by the municipal corporations, 22.5 lakh commercial vehicles-around 75,000 every day-cross Delhi borders every month. These vehicles are ending their journey in Delhi and pay the corporations a toll tax. Unofficial estimates by sources in the transport department-which is supposed to enforce the rules-put the number at over a lakh trucks every day. However, many trucks are not to end their journey in Delhi and are overloaded. All use the city's infrastructure, spew deadly smoke and increase pollution levels and traffic jams./In 2001, the Supreme Court had ordered that from January 2002, ""no heavy, medium or light goods vehicles will ply on interstate routes by passing through Delhi or New Delhi"". Only those goods vehicles which on payment of octroi/toll tax carry goods to or from Delhi would be allowed to ply, it declared. More than a decade later, the order remains merely on paper. Neither the corporations, nor the transport department nor Delhi Police is willing to take the responsibility of implementing it./With another hearing due on September 30, TOI takes a look at what's wrong with the borders of Delhi./Lack of enforcement/The borders or entry points are where the enforcement is supposed to be at most strict. Officials from the transport department, corporations and Delhi Police are to ensure compliance of not only the SC order but also Delhi's own transport policies at these points./The reality is, however, light years away. While toll is collected at 121 points by the corporations, commercial vehicles use around 23 major entry points. Of these, the five major points for trucks is NH-24, DND/Kalindi Kunj, Badarpur border, NH-8 and GT Karnal Road. ""Over 60% of the trucks use these borders to enter the city. Just ramping up enforcement at these points will put an immediate check on the wrongful entry of trucks into Delhi,"" said Bhure Lal of Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), a court-mandated monitoring body./Enforcement is lax, to say the least. While some officials do man these points, enforcement tools like weigh-in bridges, pollution control centres and even basic paper checking facilities are missing. The multiplicity of authority also compounds the problem of implementation, according to EPCA, which had reported that while 6,500 trucks were entering Delhi, only 50 were turned away./In December 2012, the Delhi chief secretary decided to explore the possibility of restricting entry of heavy vehicles to six-eight points. Nothing has happened till date. Earlier this year, EPCA observed that no agency was willing to take responsibility of implementing the SC order. In January, EPCA also said entry of non-destined trucks-vehicles not meant for Delhi-was increasing air pollution levels in the city./No facilities at borders/According to government policies, the transport authority is to set up weigh-in bridges and pollution checking centres at entry points. S P Singh of Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training (IFTRT) said little checking was done at the borders. ""There is no scientific system used to check the load of the truck or if it is just passing through Delhi,"" he said./Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), which was asked by the Delhi high court to study the impact on infrastructure by non-destined trucks entering Delhi, had recommended setting up of automated weigh-in-motion systems or weighing bridges to detect overloading easily. None has been put up yet. Instead, private operators with such machines abound. Their certification is accepted if the operator has a licence, leading to malpractices. The off-loaded material is generally loaded again after weighing./Most entry points do not have any facility to segregate vehicles, leading to congestion while checking of vehicles. There are also inadequate provisions for road signs, hoardings and markings, which hamper the checking process./Verifying whether a truck is actually heading to Delhi or just passing through is easy, said Lal. But the collusion between officials and the methods used to navigate through the system is simple as well. ""The easiest way of bypassing the court order is to buy a delivery receipt slip from a company located in Delhi,"" said Lal./No turnaround facilities/One of the primary reasons for non-implementation of the SC order is the lack of facilities for turning away errant trucks. ""There are no turn-around or storage facilities at the borders where the overloaded material can be stored. Agencies claim they can't stop trucks as it will lead to jams at the entry points,"" said Lal./A joint inspection by EPCA and government agencies had identified locations where U-turn facilities could be set up and recommended that the agencies should construct such facilities. ""Even if the trucks are stopped and apprehended, where will they unload?"" asked Lal./BS IV norms/In February last year, the road transport and highways ministry had amended the national permit/tourist permit rules under Central Motor Vehicles Rules 1989. It was decided not to allow non Euro-IV compliant national permit holder trucks and tourist permit holder buses registered in NCR within the National Capital Region. ""Most trucks and buses are have been registered on interstate/national permits with BS-III compliance but these vehicles mostly operate on intra-city operations in the 13 cities, including NCR,"" said Singh./Very few vehicle manufacturers have come out with BS-IV compliant vehicles. ""A few, like Tata Motors, have vehicles with these specifications as they are expensive and the BS-IV norms are not mandatory countrywide,"" said Singh./Toll tax: A farce/The toll tax, which is meant to dissuade unnecessary entry of polluting trucks, has become a money-churner for the corporations. The tax is based on the generic nomenclature of a vehicle and the number of wheels; no attempt is made to check if it's overloaded. An EPCA report had stated: ""The officials collecting the toll tax are thus one of the most crucial elements in avoiding non-destined traffic.""/Officials collecting the toll tax are, however, neither interested in checking whether the goods vehicles are headed nor do they verify the consignment. Verifying the papers, MCD officials claimed, is Delhi Police's responsibility. Delhi Police, in turn, said there was no rule under which it could implement the order./Caught in the middle is the city which is being held to ransom as government agencies and officials make a fast buck./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution on the rise in Kerala: Report,"KOCHI: There is a rise in air pollution, especially in the respirable supended particulate matter (RSPM) and subsequent fall in oxygen content, in some parts of the state, says a report by the state pollution control board (PCB). A trend analysis of 30 stations in the past four years (2009-12) by the PCB shows that RSPM levels are above 60 microgram per cubic meter (ug/m3), which is the upper limit as per the national ambient air quality monitoring programme (NAMP) standards./While the report attributes the rise in the RSPM levels to the construction industry, rather than industrial or automobile pollution, PCB chairman K Sajeevan says that the board will take a second look at the data to see whether it is related to construction. ""As per my assessment, it could be more to do with the state of roads and vehicles which generate too much dust,"" says he./Dr George Mothi, a senior pulmonologist at Medical Trust hospital, Kochi says that there has been a rise in the number of patients reporting with respiratory diseases./While noting down the lifestyle of the patient to make an assessment of the cause of his ill-health, he finds that patients with such condition are living close to roads and construction sites or they are regular road travellers./The PCB report says that the annual average values of RSPM was found to be more than the permissible limit at seven stations in 2012./Irumpanam, a suburb in Kochi, recorded 664 ug/m3 in May 2012. The high value was due to particulates from earth excavation works done for cable laying in the road near the sampling site and the same reason was attributed for the higher annual average of 113.55 ug/m3 there, according to the study./The ambient air monitoring is done 24 hours a day for two days a week at each station. Apart from RSPM, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (S02) are monitored at four hour intervals. The permissible limit for NO2 and SO2 is 40 ug/m3 and 50 ug/m3 respectively./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Light haze in the morning as monsoon retreats from Delhi,"NEW DELHI: A day after the monsoon withdrew, the city witnessed the first sign of winter setting in. On Friday morning, a light haze enveloped Delhi and brought down visibility at IGI airport./Met officials say that with an anti-cyclone, which developed during the withdrawal of monsoon, likely to consolidate in the next few days, the haze and smog will stay over the weekend./Dr R K Jenamani, director in charge, IGI Met said: ""With the withdrawal of monsoon, there has been a rapid change in the wind pattern over northwest India, including Delhi. The anti-cyclone, which normally follows the withdrawal and is observed by mid-September, has just appeared. It The anti-cyclone is highly favorable for a stable atmosphere and calm or light winds at lower levels. What is interesting is that it has developed faster than usual, which has led to the formation of haze and smog immediately after the withdrawal of the monsoon, and not 10-15 days later as is seen,"" he said./The first fall out of the weather conditions was the drop in visibility at the airport./From 3,500m on Thursday, general visibility at IGI airport reduced by 30%, and went down to 2,500m on Friday. Met officials said models indicate the wind pattern would become static in the next three days and haze and smog conditions over Delhi were likely to stay for some time./""The usual pattern for weather changes is the setting in of smog in the first week of October, which then peaks around Diwali. This is followed by fog formation in the first or second week of December,"" said Jenamani./The anti-cyclone works by pushing air in the upper levels to lower levels. Due to this, pollutants do not get space to disperse, which leads to smoggy conditions. Air pollution levels will accordingly see a corresponding rise in the next few days./""Delhi has high pollution levels during winter. World Health Organisation on Thursday declared air pollution as a major carcinogen. Delhi still has no aggressive mechanisms in place to deal with rising pollution levels and the government has not yet brought in the promised air pollution abatement programme. Last year saw some especially severe spells of smog. We will have to wait and see how things play out this year,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, associate director, Centre for Science and Environment./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution causes lung cancer: World Health Organization,"LONDON: The World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) on Thursday declared air pollution as carcinogenic — a major cause for cancer among humans./The IARC added air pollution to Group 1 carcinogenic — the same category under which tobacco, UV radiation and plutonium come. Air pollution was known be among the causes for heart and lung diseases, but now evidence has emerged for the first time about it being carcinogenic./“There is sufficient evidence that exposure to outdoor air pollution causes lung cancer with a positive association with an increased risk of bladder cancer. Particulate matter, a major component of outdoor air pollution, was evaluated separately and was also classified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1),” said an IARC statement./IARC Monographs Section head Kurt Straif said the air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances. “We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths.”/Studies indicate exposure levels have increased significantly in some parts of the world, particularly in rapidly industrializing countries with large populations in recent years. The most recent data indicates 2.23 lakh deaths of lung cancer worldwide resulted from air pollution in 2010. The IARC Monographs Programme, dubbed the “encyclopedia of carcinogens”, provides an authoritative source of scientific evidence on cancer-causing substances and exposures./In the past, the programme evaluated many individual chemicals and specific mixtures that occur in air pollution. These included diesel engine exhaust, solvents, metals and dust. But this is the first time that experts have classified outdoor air pollution as a cause of cancer./“Our task was to evaluate the air everyone breathes rather than focus on specific air pollutants,” said Straif ’s deputy, Dana Loomis./“The results from the reviewed studies point in the same direction: the risk of developing lung cancer is significantly increased in people exposed to air pollution.”/IARC reached its conclusion after an independent review of over 1,000 scientific papers from studies on five continents./The studies analysed carcinogenicity of various pollutants present in outdoor air pollution, especially particulate matter and transportation-related pollution./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Delhi, Kolkata have worst air quality in India: Report","NEW DELHI: With the World Heath Organization's (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer declaring air pollution as a major cause of cancer, its findings have put the focus on Indian hotspots like Delhi, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Jharkhand which showed high concentration of life-threatening air pollutants./Air quality data of the government's pollution watchdog, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), for 2010 – the last one in the series of such reports on air quality across the country – shows that Kolkata and Delhi are among the worst affected cities in terms of air pollution./In fact, figures compiled by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for 2009-11 vindicate what the world health body has concluded while putting 'air pollution' in the same category as tobacco, UV radiation and plutonium as lung cancer causing agents./Quoting the ICMR data which showed that the highest number of lung cancer cases was reported during 2009-11 in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, noted environmentalist and director general of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) Sunita Narain said, ""It is a worrying development. We need to take urgent steps to find ways to deal with the menace of air pollution which directly affects our health.""/She added, ""It's not that we can't do it. Taking the message from what the WHO-backed scientific research has found, the government must immediately make Euro-IV norms in vehicles mandatory across the country and stop incentivizing car users. Government must also focus on public transport in a big way to minimize vehicular air pollution on priority basis.""/A CSE report pointed to a forecast of the National Cancer Control Programme which said more than 1.4 million people would suffer from some form of cancer in India by 2026. It also said that out of total number of cases reported during 2009-11 in Kolkata for 20 types of cancers, lung cancer had the highest share of 12%./CSE executive director of research and advocacy on air pollution Anumita Roychowdhury termed WHO's findings as a ""wake up call"" for India. She said, ""This is the first time scientists have evaluated the air people breathe for its cancer-causing potential. This is a sharp departure from assessing only specific pollutants for cancer potency.""/Her report extensively quoted figures of the Delhi Cancer Registry, AIIMS, which said Delhi alone reported 13,000 new cases of cancer every year with 10% of them being lung cancer. It stressed that all those who suffered from lung cancer in recent years did not have any history of smoking./Roychowdhury said, ""The situation demands urgent and immediate policy intervention from the government to prevent exposure early in life to reduce risk as it takes long years for this toxic effect to surface.""/She called for ""legally binding"" targets for Indian cities to meet the air quality standard and gave an example of how it was being done in the US where cities have to face cut in their federal grants if they don't meet the targets. ""Why can't we handle it through strict legal framework for cities/states in India?"" she asked./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Surge in number of cancer cases linked to air pollution',"RANCHI: Cancer cases have seen a sharp rise in Jharkhand over the past few years. In spite of this, there is no comprehensive data to deal with one of the largest killing diseases globally, primarily due to the absence of any government facility and expertise./Private medical establishments confirm what a recent report of the World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated. According to WHO, air pollutants are carcinogenic and could be considered one of the primary reasons behind cancer, particularly of the lungs./A comprehensive study on ambient air quality conducted across the country by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) in association with scientists from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi have categorized different cities and places based on the level of suspended particulate matter found in the air there and indicated that immediate control measures are essential to put the killer disease at bay./Dr Aftab, treating Oncologist at Curie Abdur Razzaque Cancer Institute in Ranchi, a unit of the Health Care Global enterprise, is critical of the lack of database in Jharkhand. ""While on the one hand, no government medical hospital has the facility to treat cancer, on the other complete absence of patients database deters private experts from coming up with a regional treatment protocol,"" he said./Admitting that aroud 150-200 cancer patients come to the hospital every month, he said 80% of them are diagnosed with cancer but even after diagnosis little less than 50% are able to go ahead with the cost-intensive treatment. ""The BPL families supported by government with a fund of Rs.1.5 lakh often undergo treatment whereas people coming from higher middle-class families and high-income group move out of state for treatment in super speciality centres. As a result of this, exact figure of patients with cancer is not available at any hospital,"" he said. He, however, added that among females carcinoma of the cervics and among males oral carcinoma is commonest. ""We do not rule out lung cancer incidence but in lack of expertise, treating doctors in rural periphery often confuse lung cancer with tuberculosis and advise a wrong treatment line,"" he cautioned./Member secretary of Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board admitted that the quality of ambient air in places like Dhanbad and Bada Jamda in West Singhbhum district was categorized to be critical during the tests conducted by CPCB. ""The report was prepared in 2010 and since then JSPCB has done a lot in improving the situation,"" he said, clarifying that the SPM level in Bada Jamda has come down to 100-150ppm as against the level of 1000ppm in 2010./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Poison to fill the air this Diwali,"KOLKATA: Diwali is likely to push up toxicity in Kolkata's air to an unprecedented high early next month. According to projections by the state pollution control board (PCB) and green NGOs, the city could record a suspended particulate matter (SPM) count five times higher than the permissible limit. Poisonous gases and metals like oxides of nitrogen, lead, chromium and zinc could be substantially higher than last year, posing a serious health hazard./Despite the 90-decibel restriction, the city's SPM and respirable particulate matter (RPM) counts have been steadily climbing each year. While there has been a 15% rise on an average over the last five years, this time the RPM and SPM levels are set to surpass previous records. The SPM count might reach 510 micro grams per meter cube, which is more than five times higher than the permissible limit./""There has been a steady influx of Chinese crackers that are more toxic. This year, these crackers have been smuggled into the city in a big way,"" said Sudipto Bhattacharya of SAFE, a green NGO that has been studying pollution in Kolkata./The RPM count, according to SAFE, could cross 200 micro grams, more than double the permissible limit of 100. Last year, it was 189 mg. But it's the toxic metals and gases like lead, chromium and oxides of nitrogen that could turn out to be even more lethal, felt experts. ""It's not just the sound but the smoke that becomes unbearable. Obviously, these toxic fumes are extremely harmful,"" said AK Ghosh of the Centre for Environment and Development, an NGO./While lead content in air was 1.38 mg last year, it could reach 1.43 mg this time. Chromium count may reach 0.13 gm, higher than last year's count of 0.11 mg. Oxides of nitrogen had clocked 92 mg last year, but this year it could reach 100 mg. The permissible limit is 80. ""Going by the influx of crackers and the annual increment, this year is likely to be a bad one. In terms of toxic emission, this year could be the worst so far,"" said Bhattacharya./The concern is shared by the environment ministry which is likely to meet the police this week. ""Thousands of banned crackers have made their way into Kolkata. It will be difficult to contain both the noise and the air pollution this time,"" said an environment department official./A lax monitoring is responsible for the steady rise in air pollution, believes Ghosh. ""Till a few years ago, the PCB would use three automated vehicles to monitor. This had helped not only to curb the noise, but also to keep toxicity in check. Also, NGOs would be roped in to maintain a vigil. Unless these are revived, toxicity can't be controlled,"" said Ghosh./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

​Carcinogens in air threaten Mumbaikars health,"The World Health Organization may have just recognized air pollution as a carcinogen but Mumbaikars have been inhaling contaminants for years. Poisonous gases from countless vehicles, manufacturing units as well as dust and allergens swirling out of its numerous construction sites could have triggered the deadly condition is many, say experts./Suspended particulate matter in the air is a mixture of solid and liquid particles, including dust, sand and smoke, the experts further said. It may also contain heavy metals such as lead, nickel and arsenic and even known carcinogens such as benzene, cadmium, chromium, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and formaldehyde./Dr Rakesh Kumar, head of National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), said some of the carcinogenic air pollutants are being measured as part of the national air monitoring system. “Benzene and toluene are already being measured, and so are PAH levels. These pollutants are much higher near industrial areas. But benzene is also found near residential areas that have higher traffic congestion.”/A six-city study conducted by NEERI in 2011 had revealed that particulate matter in Mumbai contained lead, mercury, iodine, bromine, selenium and chromium. The report also showed construction activity, including paved and unpaved road dust, is responsible for as much as 38% of the emission load of particulate matter in Mumbai. Power plants are the second biggest culprits, accounting for 20.9% of air pollution, followed by landfill open burning at 10.8%. In the vehicular category, heavy duty diesel (HDDV) vehicles contribute to 3.4% of emission, it said./“The air in Mumbai also has higher values of particulate matter, exceeding current standards through the year, except during monsoon,” said Kumar. The report further showed that sites of construction activity, emission from bakeries, hotels and stone crushers contributed to the pollution./Dr Amita Athavale, head of chest medicine, and Environmental Pollution Research Center attached to KEM Hospital, said particles once released in air do not disintegrate. “As Mumbai is a coastal city, the sea breeze may blow away some of the pollutants, but they continue to linger. In places where these particles are constantly released, over time, people do tend to contract diseases of the lungs or even cancer,” she said./Though the content of particulate matter may vary from place to place, symptoms of air pollution develop slowly. “Just as cigarette is known to cause cancer among active as well as passive smokers, similarly pollution from vehicular emission, construction sites, industrial areas and heat-generating machineries is harmful not only for workers but also for each and every Mumbaikar who may play no active part in causing the pollution,” said Dr Athavale./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
​Stubble burning continues as health concerns rise,"LUDHIANA: The paddy harvesting season has come to end and with this, the poor farmers are left with no option but to burn the leftover stubble. This has led to the city witnessing a rise in air pollution as well as a spurt in naso-bronchial allergies and skin itching cases./According to the experts, high smog in the air (due to stubble-burning) has triggered a 3-4 times increase in the number of respiratory cases especially asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). And with the Diwali round the corner the number may increase further./Dr Gurpreet Singh, senior consultant of pulmonary medicine at SPS Apollo Hospital, said, “The stubble-burning has led to a sudden jump in the number of cases of naso-bronchial allergies, including COPD and asthma. If on normal days we receive about 3-4 cases of asthma and COPD, we are presently receiving 12-14 cases. While asthma is more common among children, teenagers and younger adults, COPD is more common in elderly people. The number of cases may further go up as the pollution level increases further during Diwali.”/About the ways to avoid respiratory diseases, Dr Jagdeep Whig, a city-based chest specialist and former professor of pulmonary medicine at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), who has witnessed 20-30% increase in the number of patients with respiratory cases, said, “The best way to avoid such a scenario is to check the stubble-burning by the farmers. The government brings in laws, but fails to implement these when it comes to stubble-burning by the farmers. Even the farmers acknowledge the problem but then cite their helplessness in this regard. The preventive measures include avoiding places where there is high concentration of smoke.”/“Using mask, covering nose and face is helpful, but one shouldn’t stop or decrease asthma medication during this time. It is also advisable to rush the patients to a chest diseases’ specialist if the severity of the allergy increases,” he added. The dermatologists, too, confirmed that stubble-burning leads to high pollution level in the air, that in turn affects the skin. Dr Alka Dogra, a reputed dermatologist, said, “The high pollution level due to stubble-burning has increased the number of cases of air-borne contact dermatitis — resulting in skin itching and rashes. There has been around two times jump in the number of such cases at this time of the year.”/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"This Diwali, weather to ease pollution burden","NEW DELHI: There is a slight breather from the usually terrible air pollution scenario in Delhi. Even though we might be emitting as many or more pollutants this year, pollution levels in the next few days are likely to be lower than in 2012, thanks to the prevailing wind pattern./The System of Air quality Forecasting and Research project, set up in Delhi to monitor weather and pollution, has indicated that although Delhi is going to witness hazy and polluted conditions during the next few days, pollution content in the haze will be relatively less than compared to/last year. In fact, even if the same amount of crackers as last year are burst in the capital this Diwali, compared to last year, particulate matter levels will touch dangerous levels of around 600 micrograms per cubic meter but still be less than levels recorded in 2012. Major areas for increased pollution have been identified as Pusa, Patel Nagar, Rajendra Nagar and Delhi University./""Last year we witnessed an unusual wind phenomenon. Between October 22 and 27, northwest India saw northerly winds blowing over the region, which brought along particulate matter from biomass burning in Punjab and Haryana. While this made 2012 one of the worst years for air pollution in Delhi, Diwali, came along in the second week of November, and made things worse. PM2.5 levels were averaging 600 mg/m3 and by Diwali they went up to 900 mg/m3. This year the levels have, so far, been in the range of 150-200 mg/m3,"" said Dr Gufran Beig of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune./SAFAR has indicated that pollution levels have started rising in Delhi with the approach of winter. levels of PM2.5 and 10 are showing a rapid rise but are not expected to touch levels similar to 2012 levels due to a favourable wind pattern./""Pollution levels in Delhi are rising due to drop in temperature and presence of moisture in the atmosphere due to rain in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. At present the winds over northwest India are westerly and there are no indications of any system that will change them to northerly, which would allow pumping of huge biomass plumes from neighbouring states,"" said Beig./Levels of PM2.5 started increasing in Delhi from around 60 mg/m3 on October 13 to reach 170 mg/m3 on October 27 which is considered ""poor"", said Dr Sunil Peshin, Scientist, IMD. This trend will continue for the next few days at least and touch a high of 220 mg/m3 which is considered ""very poor"". People with respiratory and heart diseases will be at risk due to the presence of tiny particles in the air./SAFAR data has also shown that unlike 2012, there is a huge variability in air pollution levels within NCR, which is likely to continue until Diwali./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Take steps for a sound Diwali,"LUDHIANA: The festival of lights is around the corner and as custom goes, we can expect sound to surpass light by a fair margin. Ahead of the festival, specialists have cautioned pregnant women to stay away from high decibel sounds and smoke on Diwali to prevent problems due to blast trauma and high air pollution level./Dr Vineeta Munjal, consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician at Guru Teg Bahadur Charitable Hospital said, “A pregnant woman is in fact two individuals, who, if exposed to high intensity blasting fireworks, can sustain irreversible side effects. I came across two such pregnant women in 2011 and one such case in 2012 wherein women were exposed to blast trauma during the festival season. They were in the last three months of pregnancy and had to be admitted for treatment with excessive movement of the unborn baby in the womb. The women had to be hospitalized with strict bed rest and given medical management. Often, women came with pre-term labour pain due to exposure to high intensity sounds. Restlessness, irritability, hypertension and hysteria are other features noted in pregnant women exposed to noise and chemical trauma of pyrotechnics. Crackers burst in narrow alleys and closed spaces, especially by children, are responsible for most of the cases.”/However, some specialists are of the view that it is the smoke rather than the sound that causes more problems for pregnant women. Dr Vaneet Kaur, a city based gynaecologist, said, “While high level of noise during Diwali does cause excessive movement of the unborn baby, it is not dangerous and can be handled and pre-term delivery can be avoided. But high levels of smoke during Diwali does cause problems for the mother, particularly if she is asthmatic. We advise pregnant women to stay indoors on Diwali to avoid exposure to high decibel cracker blasts and smoke”./Chest specialists also said they receive pregnant women patients who face problems due to high pollution level during Diwali. Dr Gurpreet Singh, a specialist in chest diseases at SPS Apollo Hospital, treated fiver people with such problems last Diwali. “High smoke level in the air definitely affects pregnant women, who are allergic to smoke. In severe cases, if the mother suffers from asthma attacks, the child gets less oxygen supply which can affect him later in life. We advise expecting women to avoid exposure to smoke during Diwali”./Some gynaecologists concede to the ill effects of smoke on pregnant women but question the effect of sound. “While some pregnant women report increased movement of unborn babies on Diwali, the fact that loud sound is responsible for such movement is not proven. But smoke does affect pregnant women who are asthmatics”, said Dr Venus Bansal./Jyoti Kaushal, a homemaker of Lajpat Nagar who is seven months pregnant, said, “It would be better for people to celebrate clean and green Diwali as bursting crackers does no one any good. Instead, we must light up our homes with diyas and other lights to celebrate. I request all residents to celebrate clean and green Diwali”./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

This would help take suitable systematic measures to avoid the health hazards,"" Beig told TOI./Beig said pollutants, such as oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, suspended particulate matter, black carbon and benzene, were a cause for serious concern. Exposure to these pollutants, he added, leads to problems such as increased respiratory symptoms, hospitalisation for heart and lung diseases, and even premature death./The sensors at every station will be location-specific. ""For instance, if a particular area has more complaints of acid rain, the station will measure ammonia levels,"" said K S Hosalikar, deputy director general of IMD, Mumbai. ""We will make sure that the sensors are neither too close nor too far from a pollution source like a factory.

"Cracker fumes hazardous for asthma, bronchitis patients","PUNE: Inhaling fumes emitted by firecrackers not only makes one cough, go breathless and have irritation in the throat, but also worsens pre-existing conditions such as asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia. Children and the elderly with lung diseases are vulnerable, said health experts./""The levels of air pollution during Diwali reach almost 'poisonous' levels. As responsible citizens, we need to bring about awareness about the harm we cause ourselves and our neighbours when we pollute the air by bursting firecrackers,"" said chest physician Sundeep Salvi, director of Chest Research Foundation (CRF). The foundation has carried out various studies to gauge the impact of firecracker fumes on health during Diwali in Pune./The study found the level of sulphur dioxide, a toxic gas produced by the burning of firecrackers, when measured in a residential location to have reached levels more than 200 times above the safety limits prescribed by the World Health Organisation./""Inhaling such high levels of sulphur dioxide not only cause new respiratory problems such as cough, breathlessness and irritation in the throat, but also worsens pre-existing conditions such as asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia. Children and the elderly with pre-existing lung diseases are particularly vulnerable,"" Salvi said./Sparklers, flower pots (anar) and the chakri are firecrackers that produce the most air pollution. ""When thousands of people burn firecrackers at the same time, very high levels of air pollutants can remain suspended in the air for several hours and even travel long distances,"" he said./""People who have underlying lung and heart diseases should stay away from the smoke of fireworks, take their medication regularly, eat fresh fruits and drink plenty of water,"" he added./Besides, injuries by firecrackers are common during Diwali. Lack of knowledge about safety measures, absence of parental supervision and failure to maintain a safe distance from firecrackers can lead to mishaps./Eye surgeon Parikshit Gogate said, ""Fire cracker injuries have reduced over the years.

Smoke and fire to mark Diwali?,"CHENNAI: The festival of lights might turn out be a celebration of smoke and noise this year too, as the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), police and corporation are yet to come up with concrete plans to regulate use of firecrackers in the city./As always, the board has made plans to launch a public awareness campaign for a ‘green Diwali’ by distributing pamphlets across the city. The state environment ministry held a meeting on Tuesday to discuss the campaign. Fifteen vehicles will crisscross the city handing out the pamphlets./Noise and air pollution caused by firecrackers can pose a serious health hazard. The noise can trigger annoyance and aggression, hypertension, high stress levels, hearing loss and sleep disturbance. The chemicals and gases released when fireworks are set off include lead, barium and chromium, dioxins, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen and sulphur oxides, which are harmful to humans and animals./In Mumbai, non-profit organisation Awaaz Foundation and Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) tested firecrackers available in the market and found that most of them violated the Noise Guidelines, 2012, set by the Central Pollution Control Board and endorsed by the Union environment ministry . Many of these fireworks are sold across the country. Awaaz has demanded a ban on these crackers, and is developing a pollution-monitoring mobile application for residents to measure decibel levels in their neighbourhoods./TNPCB seems to have no plans to check sales of fireworks that violate norms in the city, or nab violators who sell or use crackers that exceed the permissible pollution and noise limits. An official said MPCB would have carried out the tests but it was unlikely it would have the powers to ban the firecrackers . In Tamil Nadu too, the board cannot ban crackers. A senior pollution control board official said they used to send staff to manufacturing units in Virudhunagar to collect samples. “Since the Industrial Explosives Board is directed to take care of these inspections, we limit ourselves to monitoring of pollution levels,” said an official./The Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, says that TNPCB should ensure that noise levels are within permissible limits in commercial and residential areas. The guidelines say the manufacture and sale of crackers causing a noise of more than 90 decibels (dB) at a distance of 5m from the spot it is lit at should be banned. But, TNPCB officials said they do not have the power to take action against violators . “Our powers are limited to pollution related to industries and commercial establishments ,” an official said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Precautions can ensure a safe Diwali,"ALLAHABAD: Bursting crackers may be synonymous with Diwali but caution is essential when it comes to protect the skin. Even a bit of unawareness and ignorance can spoil your day. Firecrackers could be hazardous and risky for sensitive body parts i.e. skin, ears and eyes. Doctors say that crackers release many lethal gases into the air and damage the skin./The best way to keep one's skin safe is to wear full-sleeve shirts and trousers and avoid direct contact with pollutants,"" said skin specialist Dr Shakti Basu of TB Sapru Hospital./In case of a mishap, the wound should be cleansed with normal water and antiseptic cream should applied on it, Dr Basu added. . Noted physician Dr Anil Kumar pointed out ""harmful smoke emitted by crackers can cause and aggravate asthma, allergic rhinitis, bronchitis and other respiratory problems. People prone to respiratory allergies should stay away from crackers.""/""The sound of crackers can cause permanent or temporary hearing impairment,"" he claimed./The level of air and sound pollution increases a lot on Diwali. Heavy metals like potassium chlorate, sulphur, arsenic sulphite, aluminium and copper are found abundantly in the air post-Diwali./High levels of residual particulate matter (RPM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) emanate from firecrackers and leads to health complications mainly skin problems. Dr Basu claimed that consequential air pollution triggers a train of allergies that have hazardous impact on human health. Therefore, the first and foremost precaution is to be prepared adequately for it. Allergic people should avoid contact with firecrackers./""Do not leave your nostrils dry. Apply cold cream in the nostrils so the harmful gases have less effect,"" he advised. Doctors at government hospital and other units attend severe cases of skin allergy after the Diwali, every year. ""Due to high pollutant levels, symptoms like eye burns, running nose, skin allergy and skin rashes are often noticed,"" said the doctors./Experts point out that dust and pollutants from the firecrackers take at least 48 or 72 hours to settle down and cause hurtful effect on allergic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, bronchial asthma, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, pneumonia and common cold./Doctors at Beli Hospital said ""different types of allergies are triggered by dangerous chemicals emitted out the crackers. The most common pollutant released is Nitrogen Oxide. It triggers skin irritation, eye problems and respiratory problems among children and elderly./Moreover, sulphurdioxide released by crackers has a damaging affect on the lungs it also causes wheezing & shortness of breath./Ironically, the dust particles released by bursting of firecrackers are a concern for people allergic to dust particles./Bronchitis and asthma patients should increase their medicine intake during this period of the year as heavy metals such as lead and cadmium contained in firecrackers make breathing troublesome for them./People should take precautions during the festival and consult doctors if feeling perplexed.

Cracker of a Diwali sans crackers,"This Diwali, some responsible youngsters are giving bursting of crackers a miss, and are planning to celebrate the festival of lights in a safe, noiseless and eco-friendly way./For most of us, Diwali shopping goes beyond clothes, curtains and gifts – it also includes firecrackers. It’s almost a ritual for many to buy the latest and the noisiest firecrackers available in the market. However, there are some youngsters, who have vowed not to burst crackers this Diwali, for varied reasons, and celebrate a noiseless festival with their loved ones./My pet gets affected by the noise pollution/It’s been four years since we brought home Scooby, our Pomeranian dog. I was never in favour of bursting crackers, but after Scooby came into our life, we decided to stop bursting crackers altogether. Diwali is quite nightmarish for him as the loud noise really scares him and he gets irritable. Even though we can’t ask others to stop bursting crackers, we don’t burst crackers anymore./– Gaurika Sethi, a student of Kalindi College bad for environment/Bursting crackers is like burning money. I have seen people splurging crazy amounts of money on them. What they don’t realize is the fact that it is affecting the environment in a harmful way.

Pollution levels go through the roof as Chennai celebrates Diwali,"CHENNAI: Smoke and sound are always a large part of Diwali, and it was no different this year. Particulate matter in the air more than doubled in most parts of the city, while the decibel levels shot past the legal limit as people burst firecrackers to celebrate the festival./Data from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) shows that pollution levels were high, though gaseous pollutants like sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were well within prescribed standards in all the places where pollution monitors were placed./In some localities, air pollution levels were lower than previous years, probably due to the fact that fewer crackers were set off this year because of the high prices. Triplicane registered the maximum air pollution on Saturday, the highest yet in the last three years./The locality recorded 537 RSPM (respirable suspended particulate matter) on Saturday, far higher than 498 RSPM in 2011 and 246 RSPM in 2012. A preliminary report issued by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) cited abnormal increase in the SO2 and RSPM levels in Triplicane, the most polluted locality on Diwali day./Most parts of the city Sowcarpet registered a reduction in RSPM levels to 197 on Saturday compared to 459 in 2011 and 241 in 2012. The readings were still well above the permissible limit 100 microgram per cubic metre for residential areas. In the commercial hub of T Nagar though, pollution levels dropped on Diwali day compared to the reading the day before./“Triplicane has many streets and is highly congested and must have burst the most crackers on Diwali day,” said a senior TNPCB engineer. “However, the weather conditions were favourable this time. There were winds to diffuse the pollutants though it rained a little at night,” he said./Many neighbourhoods in the city were extremely noisy on Saturday. In some neighbourhoods in Triplicane, decibel levels touched touching 121dB(A), much higher than the tolerable level of 75dB(A). Nungambakkam (86), Sowcarpet (103) and T Nagar (101) were also very noisy. Besant Nagar, which is otherwise a peaceful residential area, recorded 106dB(A). The permissible limit is 55dB(A) during the day and 45dB(A) at night in residential areas./The Chennai Corporation has begun preparations to clear waste from burst crackers from the streets. “Diwali waste should be taken to the Gummidipoondi hazardous waste dumping yard as the remains of crackers and other chemical waste should not be dumped in the dumpyards in the city,” said a senior TNPCB official./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board says firecrackers produce 1,600mt tonnes of toxic waste","LUCKNOW: Before lighting up a bomb or sparkler this diwali, think of the harmful metals and chemicals that go into the making of firecrackers to emit bright, colourful and shimmering lights and a booming sound. Since substances in crackers are toxic, the waste generated poses severe threat to environment./According to Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), bursting of fire crackers generated 1,600 metric tonne of waste containing harmful substances and chemicals in Lucknow on Diwali day in 2012. Every year, the toxic waste produced by fire crackers goes up by nearly 100-150 metric tonnes, say experts./""After Diwali festivities, toxic waste is thrown at either landfill sites or the river which affects the ecosystem adversely. The poisonous metals in the waste enter the food chain through soil and water. As it directly impacts the environment and health, it can cause serious diseases and even lead to death by lead poisoning and other such,"" said Anoop Mishra, president of Sankalp Parivar, who has been creating awareness among students about hazards of burning crackers for the past many years. Mishra added that the metal loaded with fire crackers also results in death of animals and plants./Every year, there has been significant increase in the level of noise and air pollution during Diwali compared to other days. As per a survey conducted by Central Pollution Control Board which studied the air pre-Diwali and Diwali-day, pollution level had gone up by 56% and 42% in Indiranagar and Gomtinagar, respectively. Similarly, noise pollution in several areas of the city was more than the standards for noise levels during day and night hours./Experts also said the crackers contain elements like copper, cadmium, sulphur, aluminium, barium and various others that help in releasing vibrant colours after it is ignited. Once a cracker is burnt, it releases toxic chemicals that remain suspended for long time causing serious health aliments. ""Harmful substances produced by crackers settle on tree leaves or any other surface in dust form. As it remains in atmosphere for a longer duration, people inhale it regularly which causes many breathing problems,"" said Dr PK Gupta./As per Lucknow Atishbazi Udyog Vyapar Mandal, in 2012, people in Lucknow purchased crackers worth nearly Rs 30-35 crore. Similarly, as per a combined study of many NGOs, crackers worth Rs 4,000 crore are burned in India on the day of Diwali. ""The money spent on fire crackers can be utilised in bringing light to the lives of children who are living in darkness. Instead of shelling out on crackers, the same money can be donated for education of a poor child,"" said Mishra./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Diwali fumes put walkers at risk,"KOLKATA: The mention of another spell of rain may make you grumble, but nothing short of a downpour will clean up the toxins in the air after Diwali. And if you are among those who can't do without a morning walk, get yourself a pollution mask because the smoke-heavy air isn't what you should be breathing./Air pollution during Diwali this year has been worse than last year, say experts. ""Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) shoots up five times during Diwali. Levels of nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and heavy metals like lead, chromium and zinc also rise, triggering or worsening diseases like bronchial asthma and allergic reactions. In the long run, it can even cause lung cancer,"" said Somen Ghosh, a green technologist./He advises against morning walks in the days right after Diwali. ""Even the air around the Victoria Memorial, in the heart of the city's lungs, Maidan, is not safe,"" said Ghosh, who found unusually high concentrations of SPM and nitrogen dioxide even on the day before Diwali. The readings were well above permissible levels, he told TOI./Between 4am and 8am - morning-walk time - the SPL readings in various localities varied between 247 mg/m3 and 218 mg/m3 whereas the permissible limit is 100 mg/m3. In same period, nitrogen oxide was between 130 mg and 105 mg, well above the permissible limit of 80 mg/m3. On Diwali night and the morning after, the SPM level skyrocketed beyond 400./""This is solely attributable to fireworks pollution in the form of high levels of dioxins, furans and heavy metals,"" said Sudipto Bhattacharjee of Saviour and Friends of Environment.

Air purity and peace go up in smoke with crackers,"LUCKNOW: As Lucknowites lighted up firecrackers worth nearly Rs 35 crore this year, it resulted in an increase of air pollution by over 100% and noise pollution up to 37.35% in several areas of the city. The air and noise levels recorded on the Diwali day was much above the permissible limit, revealed a survey conducted by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB)./Like every year, UPPCB collected the data of air and noise levels twice-pre-Diwali (October 29) and Diwali-day (November 03). In Aliganj (residential area), the level of respirable suspended particulate matter (PM-10), which is an indicator of air pollution, was recorded at 429.3 microgram/ metre cubes on November 3 as compared to 184.5 microgram/ metre cubes on October 29. Similarly, the levels of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide soared 200% and 71.38%, respectively on Diwali day./In Chowk (commercial area), the PM-10 level stood at 445.4 microgram/ metre cubes on Diwali day against 197.5 microgram/ metre cubes on pre-Diwali. Likewise, sulphur dioxide increased by 308% while nitrogen dioxide was more than 80% in the atmosphere on November 3./""The standard PM-10 level in the air on a given day is 100 microgram/metre cubes. It means that the festive celebration caused over four times increase in air pollution in both areas,"" said J S Yadav, member-secretary, UPPCB. The survey also stated that this year, on Diwali day, the PM-10 level was more by 12.4 and 12% in Aliganj and Chowk area respectively in comparison to last year. There was, however, only slight increase in noise levels against last year, revealed the survey./As per Lucknow Atishbazi Udyog Vyapar Mandal, denizens of Lucknow burned crackers worth around Rs 30 crore in 2012. This year, the price of crackers had gone up by about 10-15% and crackers worth nearly Rs 35 crore were sold. It implies that this time, crackers residents burst were almost equal to last year but they used crackers which produced more smoke but less noise during the festival./Though the city recorded marginal rise in noise pollution in comparison to 2012, the noise level on Diwali-day was much above the prescribed limit. In case of residential areas, the noise level was recorded at 71.70 and 67.30 decibels in Aliganj and Indiranagar, respectively against the standard noise level of 55 decibels. In silent zones, the noise level rose at 73.81 decibels in Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and 63.47 decibels in Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute. The standard noise level in silent zones, however, was only 50 decibels./Likewise, in Hazratganj, a commercial area, the noise level touched 70.20 decibels against the permissible limit of 65 decibels. Talkatora, an industrial area, was different. The noise level was at 65.20 decibels which is less than the limit of 75 decibels.

Though the RSPM level had reduced from 286 to 239 micro gram of cubic area but it is still well above the national standard level, which is making breathing difficult for persons suffering from respiratory diseases./At Ajmeri Gate too, the RSPM level was recorded at almost 294 micro gram of cubic area, which was quite high in comparison with the national standard level but it has come down from last year's 330 micro gram of cubic area./Besides, the level of oxides of sulphur and nitrogen were recorded well within the national standard level on the day of Diwali./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Lucknow braves rising pollution level,"LUCKNOW: Air pollution level in the city has registered a marginal rise this year. The post-monsoon ambient air quality report released by the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research on its 48th foundation day state that the RSPM (PM10) or respirable suspended particulate matter level at all the monitoring locations (residential, commercial and industrial areas) were higher than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. And, PM10 exhibited an increasing trend at all the commercial and industrial areas. On the other hand, the concentration of gaseous pollutants (SO2 and NOx) was well below the prescribed NAAQS at all the locations. The noise level at all the locations except the industrial areas showed higher level than the permissible limits during day and night time./Elaborating more on the post-monsoon ambient air quality report, SC Barman, scientist at IITR, said, ""In residential areas (Aliganj, Vikas Nagar, Indira Nagar & Gomti Nagar), the 24 hours average concentration of PM10 were in the range of 161.6 microgram/cubic metre to 197.8 with an average of 178.1 microgram/cubic metre. In commercial areas (Charbagh, Alambagh, Aminabad & Chowk) the average concentration of PM10 were in the range of 218.5 microgram/cubic metre to 248.8 with an average of 223.9 microgram/cubic metre. As far as the industrial area is concerned, the average concentration of PM10 was 226.97 microgram/cubic metre."" He further stated that the average concentration of PM10 was highest in Gomti Nagar (197.8 microgram/cubic metre) among residential areas and Chowk (248.8 microgram/cubic metre) in commercial areas. All the values of PM10 were above the prescribed National Ambient Air Quality Standard for industrial, residential, rural and other areas./The average concentration of sulphur dioxide (SO2) in residential areas was 13.9 microgram/cubic metre, while in the commercial areas, the average concentration of SO2 was 17.4 microgram/cubic metre. In industrial area of Amausi, the average concentration of SO2 was 18.0 microgram/cubic metre. Likewise, the average concentration of oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) in residential areas was 50.6 microgram/cubic metre, whereas in the commercial areas, it was 60.3 microgram/cubic metre. The average concentration of NOx in the industrial areas was 49.9 microgram/cubic metre. However, the values of NOx and SO2 were well within the prescribed NAAQS limit of 80 microgram/cubic metre for all the monitoring locations./The 24 hour mean concentration of trace metals (Nickel and Lead) in ambient air associated with PM10 were found to be 12.7 nanogram per metre cube for Nickel and 163.1 nanogram per metre cube for Lead. On the noise front, in the residential areas, the day and night time noise levels were recorded between 62.2 to 68.4 dB(A) and 54.2 to 60.2 dB(A) respectively. All the values were higher than the prescribed limit of 55 dB (A) and 45 dB (A) respectively. In commercial and heavy traffic area, the day and night time noise levels were recorded between 68.2 to 74.5 dB (A). Noise level at all the commercial sites during day and night was found above the prescribed limit of 65 dB (A) and 55 dB (A) respectively. In industrial area of Amausi, the day and night time noise levels were recorded 68.9 dB (A) and 65.5 dB (A) respectively. Noise levels at the industrial location in the day and night time was found below the prescribed limit of 75.0 dB (A) and 70.0 dB (A) respectively./IMPACT ON HEALTH: At elevated levels, all the pollutants including metals have adverse effects on human and environmental health. Accumulation of pollutants in the human body through inhalation of air is an important route. Results of the present study revealed that higher level of particulate matter especially the PM10 and PM2.5 at all the monitoring locations are more dangerous for human health and responsible for several cardiovascular and respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, reproductive development, increased risk of preterm birth and even mortality and morbidity rate. It is reported that the total daily mortality increased by approximately 1% for every 10 microgram per cubic metre increase in PM10 concentration./Human exposure to particulate air pollution has been identified as a risk factor for human mortality and morbidity and many countries have revised the limits for PM10 as previously defined and set up new quantitative standards for PM2.5. Nevertheless, PM thresholds levels to which exposure does not lead to adverse effects on human health have not yet been clearly identified and there is a substantial inter-individual variability in exposure and in the response and it is difficult to establish a standard or guideline value that will lead to a complete protection of every individual against all possible adverse health effects of particulate matter./The effect of PM depends on the mass and number concentration, shape and size and the composition and concentration of other inorganic and organic pollutants associated with it. In the present study, the concentration of SO2 and NOx were found to be below permissible limit (80 µg/m3) of NAAQS (MoEF 2009), but there are several reports that gaseous pollutants are related with respiratory diseases and reproductive and developmental effect even at low concentration. Vehicular traffic and NO2 are associated with significantly higher risk of lung cancer./RECOMMENDATIONS/Subsidized public mass transport (Metro, Monorail etc) must be introduced/strengthened to minimize use of personal vehicles./Improvement in the traffic management./Encroachment should be removed for the smooth flow of traffic./Public awareness programme for reduction of automobile pollution./Pressure horns to be removed from all vehicles and avoid use of horn./Government should increase the parking charges on hourly basis to discourage the use of personal vehicles./Restore foot path for pedestrians./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

The energy is used in overcoming cold thus, immunity drops. Persons with less immunity, such as elderly people and diabetics are more prone to diseases in this season. The dry cold weather aggravates asthma problems,"" added Dr SK Singh./Experts added that because of the high air pollution in the city, the polluted air remain stagnated at the lower level. As respiratory problems increase, people come with complaints such as cold, sore throat, cough and sneezing, among others. When the weather is cold, the blood vessels get constricted. If a patient is already suffering from blood pressure and heart diseases, the sudden exposure to cold weather can lead to further complications, said experts./Talking about the precautionary measures, Dr Anil Nigam, ex-director of Ursula Horseman Hospital said good exercise of joints and keeping warm helps in maintaining good health. Also, people with neurological problems, who have muscle stiffness, should take similar additional precaution during this period./Doctors advise people to take precautions such as avoiding cold food, keeping warm, exercising regularly, staying hydrated, maintaining moisture in the skin and maintaining personal hygiene to prevent diseases./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air purity, sound level ban go up in smoke with crackers","AURANGABAD: Air as well as noise pollutant levels shot up to twice their permissible limits in various parts of the city on Sunday (Diwali day, November 3) evening, revealed a survey conducted by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB)./The most polluted air on Diwali night was at Kranti Chowk and Gulmandi, at the heart of the city. While emissions from firecrackers burst on Diwali did not push up the level of gaseous pollutants much, particulate matter levels touched an unhealthy high./Aurangabad citizens lit up 50% less firecrackers this year. Yet, the rise in air pollution stood at over 200%, while noise pollution shot up to 50% in several areas of the city. Air and noise levels recorded on Diwali day was much above the permissible limits, the survey stated./The regional MPCB collected data of air and noise levels on Diwali days, November 3-5, 2013. In the residential area of S B College, the level of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), which is an indicator of air pollution, was recorded at 204.96 microgram/ metre cubes on November 3, as compared to the average reading of 77 microgram/ metre cubes in October. The levels of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide did not cross the permissible limit of 80 microgram/ metre cubes on Diwali day./As per directions of the Supreme Court, bursting of sound-emitting firecrackers has been banned between 10pm to 6am. The direction, however, was openly flouted in Aurangabad as firecrackers were burst through the night on Diwali evening, November 3, the MPCB's records reveal./At Gulmandi the noise level recorded between 9pm and 6am was 88.02dB, while at City Chowk it was 87.4; at Kranti Chowk, 94.2; at Osmanpura 86.4 and at Cidco residency, it was recorded 87.5 dB. ""Permissible noise level in commercial areas in daytime is 65 dB and at night, it is 55 dB. In residential areas, the permissible level is 55 dB in the daytime and 45 dB at night. Daytime is reckoned from 6am to 10 pm. Nighttime is reckoned from 10pm to 6am,"" said Pravin Joshi, regional manager, MPCB./Firecracker traders may have reported a drop of about 50% in sales this Diwali, but the city still had its share of deafening blasts on Sunday evening, with noise levels breaching the permissible barrier of 55 decibels (dB) in many areas. The 10pm deadline for bursting crackers was also conveniently ignored in most areas./Noise levels recorded by the MPCB on Diwali night showed that this crossed the 90-decibel mark in certain locations. The Kranti Chowk area was the noisiest this year, with the noise level touching the 94.2 dB mark between 9pm and 10pm on November 3, Diwali evening. The noise levels at the heart of the city in Gumandi, City Chowk, Osmanpura and Cidco residency too crossed the permissible limit between 9pm and 10pm on November 3, where the MPCB had recorded noise levels of 88.02, 87.04, 86.04 and 87.05 dB, respectively./In the commercial area of S B College, the RSPM level stood at 233.1 microgram/ metre cubes on November 5, 2013, against 77 microgram/ metre cubes pre-Diwali. Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide remained stable in the atmosphere on November 3./""The standard RSPM level in the air on a given day is 100 microgram/metre cubes. This means that the festive celebrations caused over twice an increase in air pollution in both areas,"" Joshi told TOI on Monday. The survey also stated that this year, on Diwali day, the RSPM level was more by 12% in S B College, CADA Office and Collector Office areas, crossing the permissible limits on all three days of the festival./According to representatives of the Aurangabad Firecrackers Association, bursting crackers has gone down in Aurangabad over the last two years. This year, the price rise of crackers by about 10-15% kept people away from buying more crackers./Attributing the rise in pollution levels to excessive bursting of firecrackers, open garbage burning and heavy traffic, Joshi said, ""Though awareness camps were conducted through various NGOs at schools and organisations prior to Diwali to educate people on a pollution-free festival, the efforts have been futile. The department also got notices published in various newspapers about regulations to curb noise and air pollution, but to no avail. This implies that intense awareness campaigns are required to educate people.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Residents call for closure of foundry,"COIMBATORE: Alleging large-scale pollution from a foundry operating in their locality, residents of P K D Nagar at Peelamedu in the city submitted a petition to the district collector demanding appropriate action. ""Exposure to foundry dust has caused severe respiratory problems to the residents and we are unable to cope with it,"" B Ramu, a resident said. Representing the issue to the district collector Archana Patnaik, residents said they have to keep almost everything covered in their houses as the dust enters their houses and spreads all over./Claiming that they spend most of their time cleaning the dust, Ramu said large-scale pollution in this area is causing asthma and other allergies./The foundry, which has been running for more than 25 years, does grey iron casting. ""When dust and air pollution was normal we tolerated it but now it has increased beyond out tolerance level,"" said another resident. Residents had brought foundry dust in packets to show the district collector./The petitioners also suspected that the foundry is emitting dust and smoke beyond permissible limits and demanded the authorities to ensure that the foundry follows all the norms. ""We are expecting appropriate action from the authorities as no responsible action was taken by the foundry management despite our representations"" Marisamy, another resident of P K D Nagar said./The foundry management was unavailable for a comment./A majority of the micro and small industries in Coimbatore are located in residential areas. In many places, the units and the residents are at loggerheads.

20% lung cancer caused by air pollution,"HYDERABAD: Around 20% of lung cancer patients who eventually die in the city are exposed to high levels of air pollution, city doctors said, weeks after the WHO classified pollution as carcinogenic to humans and leading to lakhs of deaths globally./The air in Hyderabad is dangerously laced with carcinogenic agent benzene and ozone and their levels shoot up dangerously in summer months, says the Central Pollution Control Board./At the Chest Hospital, at least 25 new cases of lung cancer are reported every month, while individual oncologists in the city receive up to 10 cases on an average./“Rising pollution is related to rising incidence of lung cancer. After Delhi, Hyderabad has reached a stage, where harmful substances in the air are recorded much above normal levels at most of the junctions,” said Dr P N S Reddy, a top pulmonologist with Yashoda Hospital and former superintendent at the Chest Hospital./Majority of these patients report late to specialists and the delayed diagnosis enormously shoots up the mortality rate among patients with the cure rate at a dismal 10%./“We all the time used to say air pollution is the contributory factor for lung cancer, but the WHO’s revelation shows that a lot is at stake,” said Dr Praveen Saxena, an expert in environment medicine./Experts attribute the rise in lung cancer among non-smokers to diesel smoke, which is the main pollutant in the city, with disastrous health consequences ./They say diesel smoke is so dangerous that the changes can either result in cancer or can get carried on to the next generation./“The particulate matter of diesel has got mutation changes capacity. It can cause changes in the DNA and RNA and also cause changes in the cell metabolism,” said pulmonologist Dr Vyaykarnam Nageshwar./Autorickshaws are the major contributors to the harmful diesel exhausts, he added. The other causes of air pollution are power generation, industrial or agricultural emissions and residential heating and cooking. Experts also say that people who have air condition in cars feel they have avoided the toxic effluents but not really./“You need to pull down your glass after you cross the polluted area to allow proper cross ventilation. When the glass is not pulled down, there is some amount of pollution in the car itself,” said Dr Nageshwar ./Lung cancer statistics are startling with 80,000 new lung cancer cases detected in India every year, of which around 90% die./“The problem is majority of the lung cancer cases are automatically assumed to be tuberculosis. By the time we figure out it is lung cancer we lose a lot of valuable time. If detected early, it can be cured,” says Dr Saikrishna Yendamuri , head thoracic surgery at the Citizen’s Hospital . Deteriorating air quality can be disastrous for children, experts say. By adopting simple measures such as wearing face masks and full helmets, the effects of vehicular pollution can be reduced to a certain extent, he suggests./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Max hospital organizes workshop on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"CHANDIGARH: As many as 100 people took part in a workshop on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) organized at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Mohali (MSSH) to mark World COPD today./Speaking during occasion, Dr. Deepak Bhasin, consultant at MSSH said that as per WHO statistics, COPD was likely to become the third leading cause of death by 2030. COPD was one of the most common lung diseases which made it difficult for the patient to breathe. Tobacco smoking, indoor and outdoor air pollution and exposure to occupational dusts and chemicals were the key risk factors for COPD. As per Association of Physicians statics , COPD killed more than 3 million people every year thus making it the 4th largest cause of death in the world./He said, there were two main forms of COPD. The first form chronic bronchitis involved a long-term cough with mucus, and Emphysema involved destruction of the lungs over time. Most people with COPD have a combination of both conditions./Talking about the symptoms of COPD, Dr Bhasin said that the symptoms of COPD included cough, with or without mucus, fatigue, many respiratory infections, shortness of breath which got worse with mild activity, trouble in catching one's breath and wheezing. As COPD symptoms developed slowly, some people might not know that they were sick and hence it was advisable to get a Spirometry Test done regularly./There were many things one could do to relieve the symptoms and keep the disease from getting worse, asserted Dr Bhasin. First and foremost was that persons with COPD must stop smoking. This was the best way to slow down the lung damage./Regular exercising and eating a healthy diet could help you remained active and healthy. COPD could lead to many complications including irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), need for a breathing machine and oxygen therapy, right-side heart failure, pneumonia, pneumothorax, severe weight loss, malnutrition and osteoporosis, maintained Dr Bhasin./While emphasizing the need of regular Spirometry test, Dr Bhasin explained Spirometry was a simple and painless way to determine lung health and we hope that through this workshop we were able to raise awareness about Spirometry which was gold standard for diagnosis of COPD. The test was performed with a hand-held device called a Spirometer and could easily be used by patients with the assistance of an experienced technician. Spirometry was a convenient, non-invasive procedure which could be performed in the privacy of doctor's office or at an in-patient or out-patient facility. COPD caused the air in the lungs to be exhaled at a slower rate and in a smaller amount compared to a normal healthy person. Hence, the Spirometer was able to gauge the current condition of the lungs and the doctor could advise corrective action, if necessary."
'Little awareness or research on chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder',"NAGPUR: Currently, it is the fourth leading cause of deaths in the world, a rank above from being the fifth leading cause only a decade ago. By 2030, the chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) is projected to be responsible for 30% more deaths in the next ten years, becoming the third leading cause of death in the world./Despite being totally preventable and having a clear link with smoking, exposure to air pollution and certain chemicals, the increase in people suffering from COPD is alarming. Even the World Health Organisation has believes that prevention of the disease requires urgent attention. That is why the theme for this year's COPD day was 'It's never too late'./The disease is a grossly under diagnosed one in India, believes pulmonologist and director of Getwell Hospital Dr Rajesh Swarnakar. ""We always talk about diseases like HIV and diabetes being dangerous, but a disease whose incidence is more than them is not even discussed. Half of the patients of the disease themselves do not know they are suffering from it until the disease takes on extreme proportions. While smoking is the biggest cause of COPD, it is also caused by burning biofuels indoors and so many rural women in South Asian countries who cook on chullahs are also affected by it,"" he said./He also pointed out that since the number of smokers is going down in most developed countries, the disease is increasingly becoming a problem of the developing world. ""This is one reason why there is little awareness of and research on COPD,"" said Dr Swarnakar./Pulmanologist Dr Vikrant Deshpande insists that all doctors must intervene for any patient who has the habit of smoking. ""This will help not only to reduce the burden of COPD, of which smoking is the commonest cause, but many other conditions. Doctors can help a lot by playing a more assertive and proactive role in helping people to quit smoking,"" he said. It is big problem especially for the youngsters more and more of whom are getting hooked to the habit, making it even more dangerous, he added./ALL ABOUT COPD/The chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder is a progressive lung disease that makes breathing more and more difficult over time. It is a potentially life threatening condition./CAUSES/Tobacco smoke: Not just smokers, but long term exposure can cause second hand smokers to fall prey to the disease./Indoor air pollution: Burning biomass, like wood and coal, indoors./Outdoor air pollution./Occupational hazard: Exposure to chemicals, fumes or even dust at workplaces./SYMPTOMS/Cough, often chronic and sometimes with mucus./Shortness of breath that makes everyday activities difficult and worsens with time./PREVENTION/Avoid smoking, or quit the habit./Avoid long time exposure to chemical fumes, dust and other irritants./At-risk industries like mining, construction can use measures to control dust./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Prevent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with right tests, say experts","AURANGABAD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth largest cause of death in the world now. More prevalent after 40 years of age, COPD can be diagnosed with a spirometry test, experts said on the eve of World COPD Day, November 20./The Aurangabad Chest Society (ACS) wants to improve awareness about the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), its secretary Venkatesh Deshpande said on Tuesday./""Spirometry, a simple, painless breathing test, is key to reducing the burden of one of the world's most common lung diseases. COPD is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, causing more than 3 million deaths every year. In India, approximately 30 million people are estimated to be affected by COPD and half a million die every year from the disease,"" said Deshpande./To commemorate the occasion, Aurangabad's leading chest physicians, in collaboration with a leading pharma company, have undertaken a mission of spreading awareness about the disease./""Though COPD might not be cured completely with available drugs today, proper education and awareness about the disease could surely help reduce its occurrence,"" said Deshpande. Measures like quitting smoking, use of pollution-free means of cooking and proper ventilation in residences might lower the risk of COPD significantly, said Shrikant Papinwar, former president, Chest Society, Aurangabad chapter./World COPD Day will be observed on November 20 around the theme 'It's not too late. Ask your doctor about a simple breathing test called Spirometry', which emphasises the importance of the test in diagnosing the disease. ""Many national and international COPD guidelines, including those prepared by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), identify spirometry as the gold standard for diagnosing COPD,"" said Deshpande./According to Deshpande, professionals like traffic police personnel, roadside vendors and rickshaw-pullers are more prone to COPD due to dangerous pollutants in vehicular exhaust. Use of pollution masks and regular checks of vehicles for valid Pollution Under Control Certificate (PUC) could be useful to prevent pollution from automobile exhaust, Deshpande pointed out./""COPD is a substantially under-diagnosed disorder, where diagnosis is delayed until the condition reaches an advanced state. Spirometery is the most frequently used pulmonary function test and enables health professionals to make an objective measurement of airflow obstruction and assess the degree to which it is reversible,"" said pulmologist Masood Ahmed./Though smoking is the major cause of COPD, rapid industrialisation and vehicular emission has impacted the lung health of even those not exposed to smoke of any kind, Ahmed said./Pulmonologists in the city said that they have observed that about 90% of COPD patients are smokers, while 10% are non-potential victims, such as women who work in ill-ventilated kitchens./In rural areas surrounding Aurangabad, 60% of COPD patients are smokers, while 40% are women, who develop the disease due to prolonged exposure to biomass fuel since childhood./Pulmonologists use broncho-dilator medicines to test a patient's lung capacity. ""Often, patients may mistake breathing difficulties being caused by heart problems, whereas it could be due to COPD,"" said Deshpande./""Once the disease develops into the advanced stage, it affects multiple organs. Complications include breathing difficulty, which could affect the heart, putting a patient at risk of heart-attacks or heart failures. Diabetes worsens the condition, leading patients to develop stroke. Inevitably, patients are malnourished and develop sleep disorders,"" said pulmologist Suhas Bardapurkar./Papinwar said quitting smoking and taking up physiotherapy and respiratory exercises have a therapeutic effect. ""Pollution due to industries, automobiles, burning of garbage in open land, sugar factories and spinning mills in the region too are contributing factors to air pollution,"" he said./""COPD is a disease appearing similar to asthma, but occurs in the elderly and is much more lethal and painful,"" said ACS secretary Shrikant Sahastrabuddhe. He added that COPD is a non-communicable lung disease related to exposure that progressively increases in breathlessness./""The early symptoms of COPD are chronic cough, spewing sputum and breathlessness during physical activity such as exercise or walking. Smoking remains one of the most important causes of COPD,"" said Deshpande./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Chronic respiratory illness cases rise with air pollution,"CHENNAI: You don’t have to be a smoker to get chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which causes severe breathing problems. Vehicular pollution, which is increasing rapidly in our cities, is equally harmful. In Chennai, where the number of vehicles is growing alarmingly, ENT and pulmonology clinics are seeing a surge in cases of respiratory illnesses caused due to severe air pollution./Dr G S Vijayachandar, pulmonologist at the Institute of Thoracic Medicine, says 200 of the 300 patients suffer from blockages in the airway tract due to air pollution. “Episodes of difficulty in breathing can be triggered by allergens, infections and environmental pollutants. A large chunk of patients with asthma and bronchitis suffer from dust allergy,” he says./The pollution control board’s permissible limit for respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) is 100 microgram/cubic metre. “But the levels of pollutants are twice the permissible amount in several city areas, and with nearly 40 lakh vehicles on the roads every day, immediate steps have to be taken to control the situation,” he adds./The Allergy and Pulmonology Clinic at the Madras ENT Research Foundation (MERF) has registered 1,427 cases of respiratory illnesses in the last one year, with asthma and COPD topping the list. “With its humid weather acting as a trigger, Chennai seems to choke with respiratory issues,” says MERF managing director Dr Mohan Kameswaran. He said 90% of the patients coming to the clinic had dust allergy stemming from environmental pollution. “Earlier only adults had such problems. Now, even children are suffering. We see patients coming in with conjunctivitis, wheezing, nasal bleeding and inflammation, all results of inhaling soot and carbon particles emitted from vehicles.”/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Poor nations account for 90% Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease mortality: WHO report,"VARANASI: The Indian Chest Society (ICS) will organise spirometry training camps for physicians and public awareness camps at 36 centres across the country to mark the COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) Day on Wednesday, November 20./On the initiative of the World Health Organisation (WHO) November 20 is observed as World COPD Day across the world./""The COPD is the rapidly increasing lung disease and no medication is available to reverse the process. The COPD can be easily prevented and its progression can be retarded by increasing awareness among the masses and medical fraternity,"" said Dr JK Samaria, ICS secretary and professor and head of the department of chest diseases, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University./According to Samaria, COPD is a disease with similar symptoms as asthma but is much more lethal and different. It is characterized by prolonged cough with excess sputum production and breathlessness./Initially the breathlessness is observed after light work-out but gradually it might occur anytime even when the person is not involved in any physical activity./The breathlessness caused due to asthma can be completely cured after proper medication, but unfortunately same is not the case with COPD. The patient of COPD can never be cured completely and has to continue medication for lifetime./Showing its concern over rapidly increasing cases of COPD, the WHO decided to observed COPD Day annually to spread awareness among common people as well as the medical professionals about the dreaded disease./Dr Samaria said the COPD is the fourth largest cause of mortality in USA. According to the data published by the Maharashtra government, COPD occupies the top position in top 10 causes of death in Mumbai./The difference between death rate of COPD and other lethal diseases such as cardiac arrest, diabetes and stroke is more than double./A survey conducted at various centres of the country in 2010 revealed the fact that there were over 50 million COPD patients in India. The prevalence of COPD in non-smoking women patients was quite significant and the ratio of men to women COPD patients was as high as 1.5:1 in the country./In a survey conducted in India it was observed that occurrence of COPD among the non-smokers is more than among smokers./This data comes as a shocking surprise as it is contrary to the rest of the world. This data cause more concern due to the fact that the non-smokers hardly ever realise that they might develop a lethal disease like COPD./According to a report of WHO, more than 90% of COPD mortality involves poor countries with people having lower per capita income. In India the COPD among the rural females is a major cause of concern. Among these women cooking on cow dung and wooden fire is one of the major causes of COPD./Two billon kg of biomass fuel is burnt every day in the world, producing 25 million liters of polluted air affecting 3000 million people across the world and causing COPD. The disease spreads rapidly among people living in rural and semi-urban localities due to use of kerosene stoves for cooking, lack of proper ventilation and usage of mosquito coils. Atmospheric air pollution is yet another major cause of COPD and ever increasing quantum of automobiles and pollution due to their exhaust is making the matter worst./Samaria said that COPD might not be completely cured with available drugs today, but proper education and awareness about the disease can surely help to reduce its occurrence. Quitting smoking, use of pollutant free means of cooking, proper ventilation in the houses are a few measures that might lower the risk of COPD significantly. The use of pollution mask daily before going outdoors can also be very useful to prevent automobile exhaust pollution./Spirometry is an useful and reliable drug for early diagnosis of the disease and reduce its impact. This test is readily available at BHU Hospital and few selected private centres in Varanasi./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

It causes more deaths than those due to tuberculosis, malaria and diabetes combined./According to the WHO, deaths due to COPD are estimated to increase by 160% by 2030. The common man in India is very well aware of diseases like heart attack, diabetes, TB, malaria and AIDS, but not at all aware of a disease terminology 'COPD' which is becoming a fast growing silent epidemic./Until recently, Indian doctors had an understanding that COPD is caused predominantly by smoking based on the knowledge gained from the Western world. It is only recently that we have realized that the causes of COPD in India are different than the West./Apart from smoking, there are several other risk factors like burning of biomass, air pollution caused by vehicles and industry exhausts, occupational exposures (farming, mining, building and construction, stone cutting, leather industry and others), a previous lung tuberculosis, poorly treated chronic asthma, poor nutrition and poor socio- economic status, that are responsible for the development of COPD in India./In fact, more than 50% of the COPD in India occurs in non-smokers. Indians have lung function values that are 30% lower than Europeans, when corrected for age, gender and height./Already weakened lungs and a huge population exposed to a myriad of different risk factors for COPD are believed to be largely responsible for the growing prevalence of COPD in India./(Source: Chest Research Foundation, Pune)/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Factors like nutritional deficiencies, air pollution and smoking are contributing to the fast spread of such respiratory health hazards in the country. ""On top of it, lack of awareness is a major cause for worry,"" Walde said./The growth in lung problems can be gauged by the fact that most physicians, particularly chest specialists, treat at least 18-20 cases of respiratory ailments every day. ""The numbers of patients seeking treatment from general practitioners is likely to be much more. And, it is important that we take note of this unrecognized epidemic before it becomes too late,"" said another chest physician from the hospital./The report called ' Global Burden of Disease' released in December 2012 also confirmed that around 65% of the air pollution deaths occur in Asia and close to a quarter of this happened in India."

Global Times, the Communist Party-controlled paper, said that smog gave a military advantage to the country. The paper said air pollution might help the Chinese military by obscuring sight lines and hide the country’s weapons systems from radars and other surveillance equipment used by foreign countries./The CCTV put up an article on its website listing the advantages of pollution. Pollution makes China more equal and raises awareness among the people about the social cost of economic development, it said. It unites the Chinese people, and makes them more knowledgeable about meteorology and teaches them the English word, ‘haze’, it said./The article was later removed from the website./The official media came up for sharp criticism in Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter./“The smog makes CCTV look much stupider. They always treat us as fools,” a Weibo user wrote. “We should not entertain ourselves by this tragedy.” wrote another.

"Breathless? Blame it on temperature, trapped pollutants","PUNE: People living in Hadapsar, Katraj, Bhosari and Shivajinagar may be more susceptible to respiratory infections such as asthma and chronic bronchitis because the chill the city is currently experiencing has pushed air pollution levels to a new high in these places./The city continued to shiver with the minimum temperature at 7.4 degrees celsius on Tuesday. The levels of particulate matter less than or equal to 10 micrometer (PM10) has crossed the maximum permissible limits by more than 100% in Hadapsar, Katraj, Bhosari, Shivajinagar./Data from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) shows that on December 10, air quality of Pune had reached 'very low' levels, with some stations recording PM10 levels beyond 200 ug/m3. The maximum permissible limit is 100 ug/m3./There was a marked difference in the air quality which remained good to moderate on November 30 and on December 10. The minimum temperature on November 30 was close to 22 degrees Celsius and only Shivajinagar, Alandi and Hadapsar recorded PM10 levels a little above the permissible limits./On December 10, all locations--Pashan, Shivajinagar, airport area, Hadapsar, Alandi, Katraj, Bhosari, Nigdi and Manjari had PM10 levels hitting the roof, ranging from 103 ug/m3 to 221 ug/m3./The minimum temperature on December 10 was considerably lower, with the city experiencing around 9 degrees celsius as per IITM data. ""Hence, the increase in pollution levels,"" said Gufran Beig, IITM chief scientist and project director of System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research (SAFAR)./As the temperature drops, the boundary layer or the cape of the surface or the upper boundary of the local environment reduces in height. ""It is this boundary layer which traps the pollutants emitted from the surface and near the surface, preventing them from mixing upward and diluting into the atmosphere.

However, within 10 days, from November 30 to December 10, the minimum temperature has gone down to around 9 degrees celsius and the boundary layer has reduced to around 700 meters,"" said Beig./Though the same amount of man-made pollutants are being emitted in Pune in winter, weather conditions and cooling have brought the boundary layer down, confining the pollutants to this limited envelope. Air pollution levels have thus been ranging from moderate to very poor in Pune, Beig added./On December 7, the minimum temperature was between 12 to 13 degrees celsius and PM 10 levels crossed the 100 ug/m3 mark in all areas, shooting to 156 ug/m3 in Shivajinagar, and 168 ug/m3 in Hadapsar./When the minimum temperature in the city was around 10 degrees celsius on December 8, PM10 levels in Shivajinagar were close to 160 ug/m3, while PM 2.5 here was around 90 ug/m3, which means 'poor' air quality, said Beig. The maximum permissible limit for PM 2.5 is 60 ug/m3./On December 9, with Pune's temperature falling to around 9 degrees celsius, most polluted areas were Katraj (with PM10 levels close to 163 ug/m3, and PM 2.5 levels around 96 ug/m3), Hadapsar (with PM10 levels close to 220 ug/m3, and PM2.5 levels around 98 ug/m3) and Bhosari (with PM10 levels close to 161 ug/m3)./Forecast of pollution levels by IITM scientists, using the SAFAR model, revealed that the current levels of PM10 and PM2.5 are likely to remain almost at the same level for the next two-three days with temperature dropping further./The term Particulate Matter (PM) includes both solid particles and liquid droplets found in air. Many man-made and natural sources emit PM emissions directly or emit other pollutants that react in the atmosphere to form PM. These solid and liquid particles come in a wide range of sizes./PM has two sets of cautionary statements, which correspond to the two sizes of PM that are measured:/Particles up to 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM 2.5)/Particles up to 10 micrometers in diameter (PM 10)/Health Effects:/Health effects have been associated with exposures to PM over both short (such as a day) and longer periods (a year or more)./When exposed to even small levels of PM, people with existing heart or lung diseases-such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart disease, or ischemic heart disease-are at increased risk of premature death and or admission to hospitals or emergency rooms./The elderly are very sensitive to PM exposure. They are at increased risk of admission to hospitals or emergency rooms and premature death from heart or lung diseases./Children and people with existing lung disease may not be able to breathe as deeply or vigorously as they normally would, and they may experience symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath when exposed to levels of PM./PM can increase the susceptibility to respiratory infections and can aggravate existing respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic bronchitis, causing more use of medication and more doctor visits./(source: SAFAR Pune website)/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Vehicle fumes, construction dust cause drop in Adyar air quality","CHENNAI: It's south Chennai's pride with its beaches and large institutional spaces that are considered green lungs. But air pollution levels in Adyar have been rising rapidly in the last seven years and may soon cross permissible levels./Particulate matter has risen almost 40% since 2007, averaging 56.13 in Adyar this year, according to the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB)./The reading peaked at 94 on December 12, the highest since 2007 while Anna Nagar and T Nagar, far more polluted areas, recorded 112 and 119 respectively. A reading of 100 is considered safe./While air pollution is rising in Adyar , there has been a drop in the readings in Anna Nagar, T Nagar and Kilpauk in the same period./TNPCB performs ambient air quality checks twice a week at Adyar, Kilpauk , T Nagar and Anna Nagar. Its officials say rise in vehicle population, commercialisation and construction are the main reasons for the increase. Particulate matter (less than 10 micron ) includes substances like fly ash, cement, dust from bad roads, smoke and soot from vehicles, and pollen./Many residents of Adyar said people were letting out houses for commercial purposes in places like Kalakshetra colony , leading to congestion and pollution. “The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority rules do not allow commercialisation in primary residential areas but people do not follow them,” said Shanthi Krishnan, general secretary of Kalakshetra Colony Welfare Association./“Construction of restaurants and complexes is increasing in Adyar. This has led to an increase in traffic,” said Kamakshi Subramaniyan pointing to a restaurant being built on Gandhi Nagar Second Avenue. The smoke from the chimneys also adds to pollution./Chennai has more than 1.7 crore vehicles and 2.1 lakh new vehicles have been registered this year. There are just 45 pollution testing centres across the city./“Trees help trap particulate matter but most owners of commercial establishments and buildings cut them down to create more space,” said T D Babu, a marine biotechnologist and a resident of Shastri Nagar./“We have submitted our complaints to the assistant commissioner of our zone and the assistant engineer of TNPCB today. We expect action at the earliest,” said Usha Kumar, area councilor of ward 182, which falls within Adyar./Tea shops and grocery shops have encroached on pavements and garbage bins on the streets are overflowing , she said./“Vehicle congestion and earth excavation are the major reasons for the rise in particulate matter. We are looking into the problem and will soon take necessary steps,” said a senior official of TNPCB./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Burning of waste causing air pollution: Activists,"NOIDA: Lack of a proper solid waste management policy with Greater Noida Authority has invited the ire of residents and environmental activists. The Authority has chosen rural areas for disposing and burning municipal waste thereby causing large-scale air pollution and smog-like conditions, which has been spreading to urban areas as well./Activists allege that this practice was started after a cooperative housing society approached National Green Tribunal opposing dumping of garbage at a site owned by it in Greater Noida. They have complained that the Authority is dumping garbage adjacent to a 130m-wide road in Knowledge Park-V, near Tushiyana village./The most affected areas are Khedi, Bhanauta, Tushiyana, Sunpura, Saini, Khodna and Bhuda villages. ""An epidemic might result from this practice as chances of diseases spreading to even urban sectors cannot be ruled out,"" said Vikrant Tongad, environmentalist./In addition, garbage disposed in this area is also being burnt regularly thereby generating large quantities of smoke. As a result, smog-like conditions have been prevailing in the area and spreading to expressways and main roads./Activists have written to Greater Noida Authority and the district magistrate demanding end of this practice. They have asked Greater Noida Authority to speed up work on the proposed solid waste disposal plant in Astauli village./They have also drawn the attention of EPCA-NCR to the issue of air pollution and diseases resulting from improper disposal of solid waste./Greater Noida Authority officials said that the site has been chosen for waste disposal during the period the proposed MSW plant is commissioned. They have also rejected complaints of burning garbage. ""The waste is probably being burnt by some miscreants despite prohibition. We have launched an inspection and will heavily penalize the offenders,"" said a senior official./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Thick smog hints at increased air pollution,"NEW DELHI: It was not just gloomy and cold, but Saturday also saw extremely high levels of air pollution in many parts of the city. Thick smog and haze that enveloped Delhi all day is an indicator of high concentration of pollutants in the air. According to Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune, PM 10 (coarse particles) levels increased by about 20% and PM 2.5 (fine respirable particles) increased by 15%, when compared to Friday. In several places, PM 10 levels were four to five times more than the prescribed levels, making people vulnerable to complications associated with respiratory illnesses./Gufran Beig, program director of System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) at IITM explained that dense fog was a result of westerly disturbance which has brought a lot of moisture and cold air, thereby lowering the boundary layer (lowest one or two kilometers of the atmosphere). ""The boundary layer is like an upper lid. It came down to 700 to 800 meters from 1 km on Friday, leading to a high concentration of pollutants. Fortunately, PM 2.5 levels, which can cause serious health impacts, were not as high as PM 10. The pollutants will wash away if it rains tomorrow,"" Beig explained./Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists believe the next few days will continue to be foggy, cold and NCR may see a light drizzle./Highest PM 10 levels were recorded from North Campus, which were over four times the standard, while lowest levels were recorded at Lodhi Road and Aya Nagar though they were twice more than normal. However, data from Delhi Pollution Control Committee indicated PM 10 levels were over five times the standard at many places. At Mandir Marg and RK Puram oxides of nitrogen was about three times the standard./Centre for Science and Environment analyzed the correlation between dense fog and pollution during December 13 to 18 at Mandir Marg and RK Puram and found that PM 10 levels doubled December 15 onwards. ""We wanted to study how the change in weather is linked to air pollution and found this huge jump in PM 10 levels over just two days,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, CSE. She added that such peaks in air pollution call for a public information system that can issue health advisories to people./Meteorologists described it to be a 'cold day' phenomenon, where daytime temperatures fall but nighttime temperature is usually normal or above normal. ""Saturday's day time temperature reduced by four degrees compared to Friday because there was no radiation from the sun. We expect similar conditions tomorrow. There may be moderate snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, light snowfall in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand and light rainfall in Punjab, Haryana and NCR. Saturday may have been the coldest day so far,"" said BP Yadav, director, IMD./The minimum and maximum temperature was 12.5 degree and 15.9 degree Celsius, with humidity of 95%. Visibility was less than 200 meters in NCR, Punjab, Haryana and North Rajasthan./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Pollution up, checking system dated","CHENNAI: Pollution levels in the city are rising like smoke from an inferno but the state pollution control board continues to cling to an outdated monitoring system, not carrying out checks on weekends, when an increase in traffic and business in commercial hubs leads to drastic drop in air quality./The board checks ambient air quality only twice a week with data from its five ambient air quality monitoring stations run by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board in Anna Nagar, T Nagar, Adyar, Vallalar Nagar and Kilpauk. Even these readings do not provide an accurate reflection of the city’s air quality because the stations are on streets with low traffic density./The city gets only a partial and inaccurate picture of pollution in the city, say experts, who point out that pollution levels should be checked round the clock as they in Delhi./Suspended particulate matter (SPM) has increased by almost 40% in Adyar this year, and in Anna Nagar, T Nagar and Kilpauk, SPM levels regularly exceed permissible levels, experts say./The SPM count is a measure of particles less than 10 microns (1 micron = 1 millionth of a metre) in diameter./Roads in some neighbourhoods are severely congested on weekends. But the state pollution control board, stuck in a time warp, believes that pollution levels are lower on weekends because schools are closed and few people commute to work. “Air pollution from sulphur oxides and nitrous oxides is lower on weekends,” a TNPCB official said./However, researchers like P Sudhakar, joint director of CPR Environmental Education Centre, say pollution on weekends can be as high as on weekdays./Residents of commercial localities say traffic is so heavy on Saturday and Sunday that pedestrians are left with no space. “You don’t need a machine to tell you that the air is more polluted on weekends,” said V S Jayaraman, who lives off Usman Road in T Nagar./In Anna Nagar, many areas are covered in a blanket of dust from metro rail construction. “There are so many vehicles on the roads, the thought of all the exhaust they generate is scary,” said S Vetrivel, a resident of Anna Nagar./TNPCB plans to install automatic monitoring systems in the city in a few months. “We will soon have a 24X7 system,” a board official said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Dust is what we eat and breathe',"KABRAI (MAHOBA): Haze is all one can see beyond 60 metres in Kabrai, a pocket of legal and illegal stone mining in Bundelkhand. The visibility reduces to zero when a stone crusher unit starts working. Green trees have grayed and concrete link roads are padded with an inch-deep layer of dust. Dust particles which get stirred each time a heavy vehicle passes through are a part of the life of people living in the mining 'infested' districts in Bundelkhand area of UP. The nuisance is a clear invitation to silicosis, a major risk factor to tuberculosis (TB). TOI, with the help of The Union fellowship, brings a spot report./* 'Dust kills us, it is what we breathe and eat': Vimla Devi owns a farm right opposite Badhwa area of Kabrai in Mahoba. She is so sick of dust that she didn't work in a mine or crushing unit despite getting an offer. ""I am happy with my identity as a farmer,"" she says. But the problem of dust is making her think about migration. ""Dust is a huge problem for all of us. It is what we eat and breathe. And we cannot do anything about it. So we are thinking of going to some other place,"" she rues. Not just Vimla, those living in the villages around these crushers are tired of the dust. ""Dust kills most of us. I know of many people who have died coughing because of dust,"" says Uma Shankar, former village pradhan of Dharrara Village - a hamlet of around 3000 people living in a place surrounded by some 40 crusher units. Doctors say that it is natural for people surrounded by so much of dust to cough all the time. This has two implications in context of health. ""People tend to ignore early signs of TB which is prolonged cough for more than three weeks. Secondly, the dust particles which settle in their lungs make their lungs quite weak. The combined effect is that when a villager goes t o see a doctor, there's hardly any time left for intervention,"" said a government doctor./* The extent of dust and risk: When the stone is crushed, a substantial percentage of the dust emissions are carried away to the surroundings by wind currents. Dust that settles within the plant gets air borne again due to vehicular movement or by wind and acts as a secondary emission source. The circulating dust is a source of environmental, health and safety problems - an aspect of mining which subsequent governments in UP have ignored. The fact stands proven when one gets to know that the last survey undertaken by UP Pollution Control Board to assess the ills of mining took place in 2002. The survey said that the extent of atmospheric air pollution in Bundelkhand was 1800 micrograms per cubic meters against the permissible limit of 200 micrograms per cubic meter. The decade between 2002 and 2012 has seen an increase in the number of lease granted for mining which suggests that the volume of suspended particulate matter must have gone up. And if the extent of illegal mining was also to be considered, then picture would have been grimmer. The Central Pollution Control Board's Comprehensive Industry Series (COIN) document on stone crushers also states that the work place environment at stone crusher sites contain millions of suspended mineral particles of respirable size that get deposited in lungs following inhalation./* Dust, disease and death: Prof Rajendra Prasad, director, Vallabhbhai Chest Institute, New Delhi, said that atmospheric particulates affect human health either by allowing penetration of the lung and causing irritation to the internal membrane, or by transporting absorbed toxic gases and vapours deeper into the lung than they would normally travel. He also said that those working in mines and stone crushers are highly vulnerable for developing silicosis (lung fibrosis caused by the inhalation of dust containing silica). ""People with silicosis have a 30-fold greater risk for developing TB. Exposure to dust that contains microscopic particles of crystalline silica forms scar tissue in the lungs, which reduces the lungs' ability to extract oxygen from the air. This also compromises a person's immunity and lets the TB bacteria prey on him,"" reveals Dr Ashutosh Dubey, government consultant for chest and lung diseases. ""We have seen how patients in advanced stage of silicosis eventually die of TB, respiratory insufficiency and heart failure,"" says Ashish Sagar, a human rights activist working in Bundelkhand. He adds that lack of safety measures like use of sprinklers while running crushers and providing safety masks and gloves to the workers were rarely followed./Surveys say it all: Different studies point out how environmental pollution in Bundelkhand was causing health problems for those working and living in the mining pockets. A joint study conducted by Institute of Environment and Development Studies, Bundelkhand University and environmental monitoring division of Indian Institute for Toxicology Research has concluded that 'maximum people (in five districts of Bundelkhand who reported at the Jhansi Medical College) suffered from asthma, pulmonary TB, bronchitis and bronchial asthma'. In Mahoba - where Kabrai is located - pulmonary TB was seen among children too. Another research paper titled ""Tuberculosis among workers exposed to free silica dust"" published in Indian Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine reveals that the prevalence of TB was found to be over 10.7% among people working in stone crushers. Those living in and around the crushers are also at risk as crushers barely follow safety norms. ""People exposed to silica at work, or those who have silicosis, have a much greater risk of pulmonary tuberculosis. Silicosis with tuberculosis or silico-tuberculosis is an important cause of death in people exposed to silica for long periods,"" reads the COIN report. It also talks about a survey study carried out in a stone crusher cluster in Trichy district of Tamil Nadu which said that workers in the stone crusher units complained of respiratory problems, eye and skin irritation, diarrhoea and lung ailments, besides general problems like headache, fever, chest pain./Poverty, malnutrition add to TB risk: It is common knowledge that compromised immunity is an open invitation to diseases. A malnourished individual usually has low resistance to fight with diseases. Unfortunately, Bundelkhand is known for its poverty-stricken people and life. The quality of life may be gauged from the fact that majority of the households use firewood for cooking purposes. This also means that the women are also exposed to household smoke which makes them even more vulnerable to diseases particularly opportunist infection like TB. ""No matter how much governments may deny, but hunger due to poverty and added misery due to loans - both institutional or from money lenders - deprives many families of two meals a day. Education is only a dream for most while status of women is low. The factors combine and manifest as diseases like TB,"" says Arundhati Dhuru, a social activist working for the cause of food security. Madhavi Kuckreja, who also works in Bundelkhand, added that women were the worst affected because of their secondary status. Children too were at risk because of high malnutrition./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Can’t breathe in the winter?,"It’s due to the air pollution and smog that is reaching critical levels in and around the city. Experts share tips on dealing with it.../Feeling short of breath when you haven’t even climbed the stairs? Do you suffer from constant eye irritation and wheezing? Put that down to the winter smog that’s currently enveloping Mumbai and its suburbs — merged with prevalent emissions from motor vehicles, noxious industry fumes and other solvents — making you gasp for breath and resulting in nasal flaring and respiratory conditions./Huge rise in number of asthma cases/The thick haze that is laced with pollutants triggers different woes from drying out the skin, to eye ailments and throat infections as well as severe respiratory disorders. One of the biggest triggers is asthma, which is usually not detected in time and commonly brushed off as ‘small breathing trouble’. Says senior consultant respiratory physician, Dr Sujeet K Rajan, “The cold air (much below body temperature) in winter acts as a trigger for asthma in winter. People who have only intermittent symptoms can get exacerbations (worsenings) of their disease in this season.” So, have cases of acute bronchitis doubled since, say, November? “There has been at least a 30% increase in both out-patient consults and indoor admission for acute exacerbations of lung disease in winter. This is usually the case,” he says./Don’t confuse asthma with acute bronchitis/While they are both breathing ailments, acute bronchitis (acute symptoms of cough and breathlessness, usually with a normal chest X-ray) is often confused with asthma, warns Dr Rajan. “The former usually lasts for a few weeks at the maximum, and settles with the same treatment as for asthma, but not required regularly. The treatment is just a short course (5 to 10 days) of inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. The problem is that when a patient is prescribed an inhaler, he automatically believes he has been diagnosed with asthma, which is not the case. Here, patient education is key; always ask the right questions,” he says./How harmful is the air you breathe?/The air in Mumbai contains a mix of gases like nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter, which are critical pollutants,” says Anumita Roy Chowdhury of the Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi./In Sion alone, NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) levels have exceeded the standard on 85% of the days in December. The maximum recorded value has gone up by 225 micrograms per cubic meter while the standard is 80./Peak level for particulate matter has gone up by four times the standard./How nutrition helps/Eating the right food can prevent further damage, says nutrition expert Dr Nupur Krishnan. “Very often we think only steroids are the answer, but our daily foods are powerful too. First and foremost, caffeine in your coffee works as bronchodilator, which dilates bronchioles, opening the airways. Vitamin C is also crucial; it keeps the lungs powerful, so have a glass of orange juice everyday. Omega 3 in any form — nuts, fish, flax seeds — is helpful for asthmatics as it works to cleanse out the lungs,” she informs./Nutritional therapist Rachna Chhachhi, who attempts to reverse asthma via nutritional therapy, says, “Asthma is an immunity disorder, hence the first thing to reverse it includes increasing immunity along with eliminating the top 5 causes (see box). Second step is flushing out allergens from the body via high doses of antioxidants.” She presents tips to avoid attacks:/-Keep away from processed foods, white flour and sugar as these block the airways by causing phlegm./-Avoid juices from tetra packs and cold drinks as these have additives/artificial colouring/-Stop processed and cured meats/-Have honey and green tea/-Take zinc supplements to flush out allergens from the blood./For asthmatics, the inhaled steroid must be regularly taken if prescribed. Patients must also keep ‘emergency medication’ — usually a short course of steroid tablets on hand, especially when travelling./5 major causes of asthma:/Environmental pollution/Toxins/Artificial colouring/Food additives/Stress/How asthmatics are affected/The inside walls of an asthmatic’s airways get swollen or inflamed. This makes the person very sensitive to irritations and can increase his/her susceptibility to an allergic reaction. As the airways narrow, less air passes through them, both to and from the lungs. It results in:/-Wheezing (a hissing sound while breathing)/-Tightness in the chest/-Breathing problems/-Coughing/The way out/Dr Sujeet Rajan presents tips to follow:/-While simple masks do help, people with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) are advised to stay away from very cold areas/-Keep yourself warm, exercise regularly./-Always carry your relief inhaler with you (if you have asthma or COPD)/-Stay far away from smokers (passive smoke is as bad, if not worse than active smoking)./-Stay away from incense sticks and keep emergency medicine with you, especially when traveling by air. Air travellers with nasal/sinus symptoms can keep a nasal steroid/antihistamine spray handy./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Dusty roads give rise to sale of masks,"VARANASI: Broken, dug up dust-covered roads of the city have added to city pollution to such an extent that people are now opting for masks to prevent respiratory problems. However, the experts say that the masks available in the market are not viable against the current status of pollution in the city./Due to digging of roads for various projects and lack of maintenance the city remains covered in clouds of dust for most of the time. Finding no end to this problem people, especially bikers, are going after dust masks available in market./With the increase in content of dust in the city's air, the surgical and medical shops here have also got a new way to make profit due to rise in sale of masks. These masks are available in the major medicine markets of Lanka, Kabirchaura, Luxa, Lahurabir, Ordarly Bazar and Kutchehry./There are two varieties of masks available in the market-Chinese and Indian. According to people engaged in this trade, the Chinese product is imported from Kolkata and Delhi, while the Indian product is imported from Kanpur, Dehradun, Pune and Bangluru. These masks are available in the price slot of Rs 40-250 which varies as per the quality. People believe that these masks are helpful in saving their lungs from the negative effects of the air pollution in the city. However, the experts say that these low-cost masks are not clinically approved and are being sold without any medical reference./Sources say that there are few shopkeepers who are selling locally produced masks, which are prepared by tailors of the city with below-standard material. The experts say that these masks are not effective and can only control 60-80% of the major dust particles./The number of patients with respiratory problems has been increased in the OPD of hospitals and other health centres in the past five years. Continuous exposure to dust results in cough and allergy. Small dust particles may cause swelling and infection in respiratory tract which might result in major problems like Bacterial Growth, Asthma, Bronchitis, and even Tuberculosis (TB)./""After a five to six-hour long ride on roads of the city, the capacity of the lungs might decrease up to 20-30% and which takes 3-4 days to recover. Continuous exposure might cause a long-term damage to lungs,"" says Dr SK Pathak, specialist of chest diseases and infection./The cold and humidity are worsening the situation. People are advised to keep even more precaution in this weather. One should take steam for 15-20 minutes every day after continues exposure to dust and air pollution. It will help keep the respiratory tract clean and will decrease the effect of pollution. People who can not afford masks are advised to cover their face with a fine cloth to prevent dust particles from entering respiratory tract./Gamchha and stole are comparatively better than the masks available in city markets as they provide better protection against dust. In summers the cloth saves from heat storms while in winters it helps against cold waves. Ever since the condition of roads have been worsening the people of the city have started depending on gamchha or stole. The masks are popular among the students as it looks cool and adds to their looks, while there is a majority of locals who still use gamchha or stole for protection against dust./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
6 amazing technologies coming soon,"From clothes that purify the air to self-healing materials; sprayable antennas to paintable batteries, scientists are working on some amazing technologies that will soon be making their way into our homes and lives.../Things that heal themselves/Synthetic materials – unlike bio-structures such as human skin – cannot heal by themselves. But imagine fixing a broken flower vase, a bicycle tyre, or a toy without any adhesives or applying heat; where all you’d need to do is hold the broken/torn parts together till they start joining at a molecular level./Well, scientists at the CIDETEC Centre for Electrochemical Technologies in Spain have created a polymer that mends itself./Nicknamed Terminator after the shape-shifting, molten T-1000 robot in the Hollywood flick, the material can bind itself together even after being severed with a razor blade. In an experiment, the scientists sliced a cylinder made of the polymer into two pieces./The two halves were then “put in contact and allowed to stand at room-temperature, without applying any pressure,” the researchers said. ‘Terminator’ started self-healing immediately; was over 90% healed within two hours, and completely healed within 24 hours. The team believes their breakthrough technology could eventually lead to self-repairing pipes, bicycle tyres and toys, among other possibilities./For water- and stain-proof surfaces/So you’ve just walked through ankle-deep muck, yet the sports shoes you’re wearing emerge absolutely dry and without any stains. Similarly, oil just rolls off your work overalls. And you can even spend an entire day painting your home, or the whole morning working in the garden, still, the jeans and gloves you have on are spot free. Amazing, huh?/What’s even more amazing is that such water- and stain-proofing technology already exists./Rust-Oleum’s NeverWet and Resource Energy Group’s Ultra-Ever Dry are two “superhydrophobic” coating technologies that can keep objects dry by repelling liquids./Both products comprise a double coating that guards practically any surface – metal, concrete, wood, plastic, fabric, leather and canvas – against staining, wear caused by exposure to moisture, and even bacteria./To protect any surface you simply have to apply the base coat, and allow it to dry for half an hour. Then, apply the second coat – and within 30 minutes, your stuff is waterproof./When a liquid hits the treated surface, it forms nearly perfect spheres that simply glide off, keeping the item clean and dry. Hah! And it even works against thicker, water-based liquids like syrups, juices and condiments./Clothes that purify/Within a few years, we could all be wearing clothes that purify the air. A collaboration between British researchers – chemist Tony Ryan from the University of Sheffield and artist-designer-professor Helen Storey from the London College of Fashion – has resulted in a liquid laundry additive called ‘CatClo’ (Catalytic Clothing), which contains nano pollutioneating particles that fight nitrogen oxides./Nitrogen oxides produced by car exhausts are a major source of ground-level air pollution in cities, aggravating asthma and other respiratory diseases. Items of clothing only need to be washed in CatClo once for the nano-particles of titanium dioxide to grip tightly onto fabric fibres./When these particles come into contact with nitrogen oxides in the air, they react with these pollutants and oxidize them./The technology is perfectly safe and is unnoticeable from the wearer’s point of view. One person wearing clothes treated with CatClo would be able to remove around 5g of nitrogen oxides from the air in a day – roughly equivalent to the amount produced each day by an average car./The team believes that if thousands of people in a typical city used the additive, it could significantly improve the local air quality. They’re now working closely with a manufacturer of environmentally-friendly cleaning products to commercialize CatClo./Antennas in a can/Sounds fantastic, doesn’t it? But it’s true. Chamtech Enterprises, based out of the US, has developed technology that will allow you to ‘spray an antenna’ whenever you need one. Their aerosol formulation lets you convert any vertical structure – including a tree, pole, wall or fence – into a radio antenna./The solution comprises thousands of nano-capacitors that lays out in the right pattern when you spray it over any surface, according to company CEO Anthony Sutera./In tests, Chamtech engineers used a painted tree to transmit signals to an airplane 22km overhead; double the range that they could get on a standard antenna on the ground./Now consider the applications: No network in any particular room of your house? Simply spray the lamppost opposite your window. Lo and behold, you have a signal-boosting antenna. Or, think about a highway where you have a painted Chamtech strip running down the road to give you seamless broadband connectivity in your vehicle. The best part? You can get rid of all the ugly cell towers; you just need to paint walls and trees./Liquid wood/In the mid 1900s, plastic – hailed as a miracle material and a product of cutting-edge science – started replacing metal, wood and glass in most consumer durables. But then, boffins started speaking about its toxicity and how its long-term use could spell ecological disaster for our planet. Now, more than half a century later – in the absence of a viable alternative – this non-biodegradable material is still used everywhere. The pen within your reach is made of it, your cell phone is too; look around, so are the water bottles in your refrigerator, the computer on your desk, and even your children’s toys./Thankfully, chemists have been hard at work for the last few decades to create sustainable, eco-friendly alternatives that do not use petroleum products in their mix. Australian company, Zeoform and Germany-based Tecnaro have independently developed durable materials that could replace plastic in the very near future./Zeoform’s material (also known as Zeoform) is made using water and cellulose from recycled paper and renewable plants like flax and industrial hemp. The resulting pellets and sheets can be sprayed or moulded to build furniture, jewellery, and even musical instruments. Halfway around the world, Tecnaro’s Arboform – aka ‘liquid wood’ – is made from natural resins and the leftover fibres created by the paper industry. The ensuing mixture can be injected into moulds to make just about anything that plastics can be used for – and it’s entirely recyclable. It can be sawed, burned and disposed of just like wood./Power in paint/Well, if you can have aerosol antennas, why not paintable batteries? Researchers at Rice University in the US have developed a lithium-ion battery that can be painted on almost any surface./The rechargeable battery consists of spray-painted layers, each representing the components in a traditional battery. Neelam Singh, a Rice graduate student, and her team formulated, mixed and tested paints for each of the five layered components – two current collectors, a cathode, an anode and a polymer separator in the middle. In tests, these materials were airbrushed onto ceramic bathroom tiles, glass, stainless steel and even a beer mug to see how well they would bond with each material./When fully charged, the batteries could power a set of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for six hours; provided a steady 2.4 volts, and displayed a very small drop in capacity even after they were put through 60 charge-discharge cycles. The Rice team plans on refining the technology over time, and believes that it could be combined with solar cells to transform almost any source – like home and office exteriors, for instance – into energy harvesters. Need more power, just paint another outer wall, eh?/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Delhi's Okhla plant gets notice for air pollution in area,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Pollution Control Committee has issued a show-cause notice to the Okhla waste-to-energy plant for violating the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. It has given plant operators 15 days to revert on why air pollution levels crossed the standard around the plant./Residents of Sukhdev Vihar and other areas near the plant have been protesting against waste-to-energy technology since 2010. They have filed a case against the Okhla waste-to-energy plant in National Green Tribunal which will be heard next on January 28./Critics are wary of the technology because incinerating all kinds of waste together—including plastics and metals—is leading to release of toxic emissions like dioxins and furans. But plant operators have been claiming they are “burning waste in specially designed boilers to ensure complete combustion. The facilities use pollution control equipment to scrub emissions”./After several inspections and warnings, DPCC and Central Pollution Control Board scientists inspected the site on Friday and found several deficiencies. They also found that air quality around the plant hadn’t improved. “We have issued a show-cause notice to them on Friday and sent a copy to all agencies including New Delhi Municipal Council and South Corporation. The plant is also shut now because their boiler isn’t working,” Sandeep Mishra, DPCC member secretary, told TOI./Residents and members of Toxic Watch Alliance, an environmental NGO, submitted a complaint to CM Arvind Kejriwal at Janata Durbar on Sunday. “DPCC has taken a major step by issuing the plant a show cause notice. After a long time they have take note of the genuine health concerns and environmental degradation that the plant is causing. We welcome this move. We have also received an acknowledgement of our complaint from the CM’s office on Sunday,” said Ranjit Devaraj of Sukhdev Vihar./Officials of Timarpur Okhla Waste Management Company said that they had received the DPCC notice and preparing to file a detailed and “scientific” report countering the complaints. “The truth is that pollution levels are always within limits around this plant. During winter, even if you blow out a little air it appears like smoke which makes residents think its pollution. The smoke from the stacks is not toxic. It just looks dense, that’s all,” said a senior official from the plant.

"Cold January in Mumbai leads to a spike in pollution, ailments","MUMBAI: January may have given the city a feel of winter, but the chill comes with a nasty sidekick: heavy air pollution. The drop in temperatures has seen cold air trap pollutants, forming a haze that spells major health trouble for many./In the last 15 days, the concentration of suspended particulate matter in the air has almost doubled. Till date, every third day this month has seen RSPM levels at twice the acceptable maximum or close to it. The levels have been over the permissible limit for the last one month./According to data collected by the pollution control body (MPCB), the air pollution monitoring unit at Sion recorded the highest RSPM level of 253 micrograms per cubic metre on January 2. The permissible limit is 100. Levels above 200 were recorded on two more days in the last fortnight. The condition has been slightly better in Bandra, which is much closer to the sea than Sion, with the highest recorded RSPM at 187 on January 7./Sulphur and nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and the particulate matters released by factories, vehicles, construction work and other similar human activities are trapped for longer in the air we breathe by the colder air in winter./It appears as a yellow or grey haze that slowly lifts as the sun warms the air through the day./The sulphur oxides have been largely within limits in the city, but the nitrogen oxide levels recorded at Sion were in the range of 150-170 ug/m3, way above the acceptable limit of 80. Again, Bandra fared better with even the nitrogen oxides staying under the 80 mark./In Mumbai, the major pollution comes from vehicles and construction activity instead of industry. ""The massive road repair and modification activities too leave a lot of dust in the atmosphere. This is something that explains why Sion records higher concentration of pollutants compared to Bandra,"" said Y B Sontakke, regional officer, MPCB. The pollution levels usually spike in January 1-15, when the temperature drops significantly in the city, he added./Weather experts call it the inversion phenomena. ""Usually, temperature decreases as altitude increases. The warmer surface temperature helps the particulate matter to disperse. However, during winter, the temperature increases till a certain height, before finally decreasing. This is called inversion,"" explained K S Hosalikar, deputy director, India Meteorological Department (IMD)./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air quality at 'critical' level in the past three days,"NEW DELHI: Over January 14-16, air pollution levels in Delhi reached a level that's linked to ""emergency conditions"" for health. Air quality in Delhi reached a ""critical"" level-i.e. on January 14, 15 and 16 the air was extremely polluted at almost all locations monitored by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research run by the ministry of earth sciences. ""Critical"" air quality impacts everyone, not just the vulnerable./Both PM10 (coarse particles) and PM2.5 (fine respirable particles) levels rose by about 50%. PM10 levels in Delhi peaked to 875-867 micrograms per cubic metre at Delhi University on December 15-16 and fluctuated between 630 and 670 micrograms per cubic metre on all three days at Mathura Road./""These levels are extremely high considering the standard is only 100 micrograms per cubic metre. Air quality is likely to be poor on January 17 as well. Pollutants are likely to dissipate after January 19,"" explained chief project scientist, SAFAR, Gufran Beig./Along with a drop in temperature, the boundary layer (lowest part of atmosphere) was lowered drastically. From a boundary layer of 200m it came down to 60-70m on January 15. On January 16, too, the boundary layer remained at 70m trapping all pollutants./Beig, however, clarified that such critical pollution levels were not because of emissions from far-off places or neighbouring states. The emissions were from localized sources like transport, burning of biomass or firewood. This is why we saw high PM10 and PM2.5 levels in Dheerpur, Mathura Road, Delhi University and Lodhi Road,"" he said./""Very poor"" air quality has become a regular feature in Delhi with PM10 levels above 300 micrograms per cubic metre most of the time. ""Elderly, those with poor immune system, cardio-vascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and respiratory illnesses, smokers, children and pregnant women are most vulnerable,"" Dr TK Joshi, director (projects) at Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health, said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Haze descends on city, ailments up this winter","PUNE: Pollution levels in the city were persistently above permissible limits with the air quality deteriorating to disturbing levels on a few occasions this winter. However, the good news is that the weather is likely to be windy in the coming days which could clear the skies of particulate matter, bringing pollution levels within the limits prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board, experts at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) said here on Friday./The PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 microns) levels in the first week of this year were more than double as compared to the same period last year. In general, the PM10 levels have been much higher this winter than the previous year, according to the data maintained by IITM./""A lot of people have noticed a haze descend upon the city recently. This is nothing but the pollutants that have accumulated near the surface of the earth in the city,"" said IITM scientist Gufran Beig, who is the programme director of the system of air quality forecasting and research (SAFAR)./According to the air quality index developed by IITM researchers, the PM10 levels remained above the permissible limits all through December. On more than a dozen occasions, the levels even exceeded the ""moderate"" range reaching ""poor"" levels./The PM2.5 (particulate matter that is less than 2.5 microns) levels were also alarmingly high, remaining well above permissible limits throughout the period and often reaching ""poor"" levels./PM10 and PM2.5 are respirable suspended particulates (RSP) and pose the maximum problems to asthma patients as well as lead to coughing, sneezing, breathlessness and irritation in the throat./Chest physician Sundeep Salvi, director of the Chest Research Foundation, said he had noticed a sharp increase in the number of respiratory track infections in the last month. ""This winter was generally colder than last year. The colder temperature and a combination of viruses and air pollution levels must have triggered the huge spate in respiratory infections,"" Salvi said./It was also a bad month for his patients who are suffering from asthma. ""Some of them had to be hospitalized while the inhaler dozes of many had to be increased,"" he said./Beig said it is not just the rise in emission levels, but a difference in weather conditions that have caused the pollution levels to rocket./Analyzing the daily temperature recorded between December 15 and January 15, IITM experts noted that the maximum temperature was 2-5 degrees Celsius lower everyday this year as compared to the temperatures last year./""The maximum temperature is usually recorded in the day time when the sun is up. This is usually a time when the pollutants from emissions can disperse into the upper layers of the atmosphere. If the maximum temperature is lower, it slows down the rate of dispersal of the pollutants allowing them to accumulate near the surface,"" Beig said./The SAFAR forecasts predict that the pollution levels should return to normal in the coming days as the wind speeds are likely to be higher. These winds will cause a horizontal dispersal of the pollutants, he added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Experts seek ban on vehicles in zoo,"KANPUR: A team of veterinary experts from Faizabad Medical College visited Kanpur Zoo on Tuesday to conduct health audit of inmates. Scientists, including Dr Debashish Niyogi from pathology department, Dr Naveen Kumar (medicine department) and Dr Rajpal Diwaker (microbiology department) of the medical college, objected to the movement of vehicles on zoo campus./Stating that vehicles also ferry various infections, experts urged the zoo administration to ban vehicle movement. They said that the vehicles not only caused air pollution but also affected the privacy of animals. ""This should be immediately checked. Even the zoo staff should not use motorcycles and cars for moving on the zoo premises. The vehicles can be carriers of various infectious diseases that can harm the animals,"" said Dr Niyogi while talking to TOI./He further said, ""We were surprised to find visitors moving in their four-wheelers on the zoo premises and honking horns. This should be strictly prohibited as honking creates stress among animals."" As the team reached the enclosure of tiger Prashant, it started roaring and continued till the verterinarians moved away from its cage. Later, Dr Niyogi said ""It seems that Prashant is in stress and this could have been caused by the honking of horns by drivers of vehicles moving on the zoo campus.""/The team then found tigress Trusha and its two cubs in a playful mood in their enclosure. The team was satisfied with the tiger family. Over here they asked about the feed of the tigers and moved ahead./The experts said that Kanpur Zoo was a natural forest and a good habitat for the wild aniamls. They were also impressed with the breeding rate of animals and outliving their life span. They made a special mention of the tiger Guddu which died at the age of 26 years and six months, inching closer to setting the world record of being the oldest tiger who survived in captivity. The doctors were also highly impressed with the care that the zoo inmates had received from the zoo staff following which their life expectancy had increased. ""Many animals in the zoo have outlived their age here in the Kanpur Zoo which is quite rare. This is possible with the good care of animals along with the proper medical care,"" said Dr Debashish Niyogi further./The team of scientists then moved from one animal enclosure to another and made notes of the feed given to the animals and the cleanliness in enclosures. These scientists were accompanied by zoo veterinarians RK Singh and UC Srivastava who took them to the enclosures of rhino, tiger, sambhar, Capuchin monkey, water birds, leopards and several other animals. The team of doctors spent sufficient time in each enclosure and inquired about the health of the inmates. They also inquired about the facilities available at the zoo hospital. They also inquired about the post-mortem procedure followed by the zoo veterinarians./At each enclosure Dr Debashish Niyogi along with two other experts gave valuable suggestions to the zoo veterinarians. They also appreciated the zoo doctors for their effort in the upkeep of zoo inmates. The experts were also satisfied with the feeding pattern followed by the zoo doctors for the animals but they laid stress over cleanliness in the enclosures especially the platform over which the feed is served to the animals. The experts from the Faizabad Veterinary College will be submitting a report regarding the health audit of the animals to the Director Kanpur Zoo, K Thomas very soon. They would also be mentioning the suggestions for the better upkeep of the animals./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Improper municipal waste management is hazardous' for human life',"VARANASI: The environmentalists expressed their serious concern over the unscientific and improper management of municipal solid waste, describing it as hazardous to human health./""Unscientific management of municipal waste, which is generally mixed with industrial or medical waste, poses serious threat to human health,"" said noted environmental scientist of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) prof BD Tripathi./According to the report of the city development plan of Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), municipal solid waste mainly comprises of waste generated from household, markets, commercial establishments, hotels, hospitals, and small scale industries in the town. It has been assumed that the local residents of towns generate solid waste at the rate of about 425 gm per capita per day on an average and total quantity of waste generated in Varanasi is about 600 MT/day./A study conducted in some areas of the city suggest that the waste, especially excreta and other liquid and solid waste from households and the community, is a serious health hazard and leads to the spread of infectious diseases if not managed properly./The case study of Varanasi city about the impact of solid waste on human health published in International Journal of Scientific and Engineering Research (November- 2013) was conducted by Pragya Singh of department of geography, HN B Garhwal (Central University), Uttarakhand./According to the study, uncontrolled hazardous wastes from industries, after mixing up with municipal wastes, create potential risks to human health. There is a specific danger of concentration of heavy metals in the food chain due to municipal solid wastes and liquid industrial effluents containing heavy metals discharged in drainage/sewerage system and /or open dumping sites of municipal solid wastes./Improper municipal solid waste disposal and management causes all types of pollution in air, soil and water. Indiscriminate dumping of wastes contaminates surface and ground water supplies. In urban areas the garbage dumped in drains clogs them creating stagnant water for insect breeding and floods during rainy seasons. Besides, burning of waste and improper incineration contributes significantly to urban air pollution. Improper disposal of waste leads to increase in the population of insects and rodent which spread diseases like cholera and dengue. The use of contaminated water for bathing, food irrigation and drinking purpose also causes many infections./A survey was carried out from June to August 2013 at selected garbage dumping sites. Random sampling was done at a dump site's area for a total of 200 samples. The data base generated for the malaria, filarial and typhoid by the primary survey from the dump sites and the data of dengue cases was collected from the health department./According to study, a total of 55 cases of Malaria, five cases of filarial and 42 cases of typhoid were reported in the identified area and 61 cases of dengue were reported in Varanasi in the month of July and August 2013. Analyzing the disease incidence data, it was observed that the maximum case of dengue and the minimum case of filarial were recorded in the study area./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Delhi witnessing third-coldest January days since 1947,"NEW DELHI: Feeling guilty about keeping your room heater on through most days of this month? Here's a finding that will justify your action. In terms of day temperatures, this month so far is the third coldest January in the city since 1947./According India Meteorological Department's data analysed by IGI met director, R K Jenamani, the average maximum temperature from January 1 to 24, 2014, was 18.75 degrees Celsius. If data from the same period (January 1 to 24) is taken, only twice since 1947 has the average maximum temperature been lower than this - 2003, when average maximum temperature was 17.85 degrees C and 1999, when it was 18.50 degrees C./Several episodes of dense fog, like the one on January 18, and overcast conditions, as seen on 21st and 22nd, have contributed to this month having a large number of sunless days. This, in turn, has meant that the maximum temperature has been unusually low. The normal maximum temperature for the month of Jan is 20.8 deg C./Analysis of maximum temperatures in January also shows that days are consistently becoming colder since the 1990s. This is linked to rising air pollution in the city, which has led to an increase in incidence of fog and haze - both these conditions screen out sunlight, leading to a drop in day temperatures. However, for the next few days, Jenamani said Delhiites can expect some respite. ""No WD is likely to cause rain in the next 10 days,"" he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Black carbon in air a worry, say scientists","PUNE: The amount of black carbon or soot, a potential cancer-causing substance, has been gradually increasing over Pune city since 2005, shows a study conducted by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)./Soot is a human carcinogenic which is considered second only to carbon dioxide in causing climate change or global warming./The research is still in its nascent stage, which means that scientists have still not been able to fix a maximum permissible limit for the substance. But scientists at the city-based IITM say that Pune's annual average soot concentration of 3.85 micro-gram per cubic meter (ug/m3) - caused by an increasing load of polluting vehicles, among others - is harmful enough, and much worse than that in the western countries./Scientists also found that the surface soot concentration over Pune is maximum between 8 am and 9 am and 8 pm to 11 pm. This is mainly due to vehicular activity and the atmospheric boundary layer effect. They added that winter black carbon concentration is about 85% of its annual average, which poses serious risk to human health, including an increase in respiratory and pulmonary diseases./Scientists P D Safai and P C S Devara of IITM told TOI that ARFI or Aerosol Radiative Forcing over India, is a collaborative project between IITM and Indian Space Research Organisation or ISRO's geosphere biosphere programme, which involves black carbon measurement over 40 cities in the country that began in 2005. They said that ARFI aims at estimating black carbon's role in and contribution to global warming as one of its objectives. The recent results show an increasing trend of surface black carbon concentration, particularly over the northern belt as compared to other parts of India./""Fundamentally, black carbon or soot is one of the members of carbon aerosol family which is emitted due to incomplete combustion of fossil fuel, primarily diesel, and petrol. It is also generated anthropogenically and/or naturally through burning of biomass and bio-fuels and forest fires. Its effects on human health are significant, hence many cities have endeavored to convert to vehicles running on CNG instead of using those that operate on diesel or petrol,"" said Devara./""Black carbon also affects rainfall through changing the large-scale monsoon circulation. Excessive soot in a region will prevent cloud droplets to grow further, which may therefore lead to a drought-like situation,"" added Devara./Safai said that black carbon levels are going up across the globe. The northern belt in India is more susceptible. ""Black carbon's warming potential is around 1 watt per square meter (W/m2) which is lower than CO2's warming potential (~1.7 W/m2). Over the course of years, from 2005 to 2013, black carbon concentration has shown a marginal increase over Pune. Though marginal, this increase is significant considering the harmful health and environmental impact of soot,"" said Safai./Devara said that winter concentration of black carbon over Pune is about 81 % more than its annual average concentration, whereas monsoon concentration is around 65 % lower than the annual average./""One usually finds the concentration more on the surface in winter as soot particles get trapped near the surface, mainly because the boundary layer of the atmosphere comes closer to the ground in this season and these particles thus do not get enough room to disperse upward,"" said Devara./The method of measurement/Continuous monitoring of surface black carbon was carried out using an Aethalometer. Black carbon data for the period of nine years (2005-2013) was studied and compared with that reported from different Indian locations. The average black carbon concentration for the period was 3.85 ug/m3 with maximum concentration occurring during winter and minimum during monsoon./As per a World Health Organization study- '2010 Global Burden of Disease'-outdoor air pollution in the form of fine particles is a much more significant public health risk than previously known-contributing annually to over 3.2 million pre-mature deaths world-wide and over 74 million years of healthy life lost. This only goes on to say how bad soot or black carbon is for human health, said researchers. Soot or black carbon being very small particles--the size of around one micron-- easily enter the human system, damaging it in several ways./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"January days getting colder, tied to rise in pollution","NEW DELHI: Days are becoming colder in the month of January in the capital in recent decades and pollution could be playing a role in forcing the trend, warn experts./In terms of day temperatures, January this year is in line to be the coldest in a decade and third coldest since 1947. It will also be the fifth consecutive year when Delhi’s average maximum temperature in January has remained below the normal of 20.8 degrees Celsius./That’s not all. January month’s average maximum temperature has been below 19 degrees C only four times since Independence — and all these instances (including this year) have come since 1998. In fact, the period from 1998 to 2014 has seen the six coldest months of January in the capital since 1947./Experts say there appears to be a link between higher frequency of ‘cold day’ conditions and increasing levels of air pollutants. Pollutants hang lower, and so accumulate more, in winter months. This leads to haze, smog and fog. Particles in the upper layer of atmosphere absorb sunlight, leading to what’s called a dimming effect. All this contributes to less sunlight reaching the surface and, consequently, low day temperatures./“There is a consensus emerging on the link between rising pollution levels and colder days,” said Gufran Beig, chief project scientist at System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). “In cold temperatures, the (atmospheric) boundary layer is low which leads to accumulation of pollutants. From our study, we know that pollution from human sources such as transport has increased which also plays a role in bringing down the boundary layer.”/R K Jenamani, director of IGI Airport Met office, wrote a paper in Current Science in 2007 showing a strong correlation between low maximum temperatures in Delhi’s winter, foggy days and high pollution levels./“Under similar meteorological conditions, we often find Delhi has more fog than cities such as Amritsar, Varanasi and Lucknow. This suggests that increased levels of pollution in the capital could be playing a role,” Jenamani said./Statistics too point to this link. Monthly averages of Delhi’s maximum temperatures in January show a drop of almost 2 degrees C since 1947, with the fall being sharper since the late 1980s. At the same time, the average number fog hours in January in the capital (visibility below 1,000m) has more than doubled since 1981, increasing from just below 5 hours per day to more than 11 hours in 2014./Then there’s air pollution, which has been steadily rising in Delhi. Data from January 14 to 16 this year shows PM10 levels at numerous locations were more than 600 micrograms per cubic metre — that’s more than six times the safe limits. PM2.5 levels were similarly high, making Delhi’s air worse than the much-maligned Beijing./It continues to get worse. A recently concluded study by post doctoral fellows at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, found a steady increase in pollution and black carbon emissions in Delhi from 2010 to 2013./According to the study, PM2.5 (fine, respirable particles) emissions were 94.26 gigagram per year (Gg/year) in 2010 increased to 107.5 Gg/year. This increasing trend was particularly seen over Rajiv Chowk, Sansad Bhawan, India Gate, IGI airport, Okhla industrial area, Pragati Maidan, IP estate and Janakpuri./The study also found that the contribution of PM2.5 emissions from the transport sector was the highest — and growing — followed by burning of biomass. In the past three years, over 32% of the PM2.5 emissions were from transport. Say Neha Parkhi and Saroj Sahu, the fellows who analysed the data, “Open biomass burning has increased PM2.5 pollution significantly in winter. Construction work and infrastructure projects also have role in increasing PM 10 emissions which have shown an increase of about 5% in the past three years./Experts say while pollutants could be increasing the chances of fog, the reverse could also be true. Said Jenamani, “Once a fog layer sets in, it contributes to making the air still. This, is turn, leads to more accumulation of pollutants in the air.”/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Delhi's air quality not as poor as Beijing's,"NEW DELHI: Delhi's air quality is indeed very poor but not as poor as Beijing's, claim scientists. After an international newspaper recently reported that Delhi's air quality this January has been worse than Beijing's, System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) - under the Union earth sciences ministry - issued a clarification on Tuesday./Data from nine monitoring stations in Delhi states that PM 2.5 (fine respirable particles) never crossed 350 micrograms per cubic metre while in Beijing it did cross 500 microgram per cubic metre and went up to 650 micrograms per cubic metre. The levels of PM 2.5 are crucial because their impact on health is far more serious than that of PM 10 (coarse particles). Since these particles are very small in size, they can easily enter the body and affect lung function. They are associated with increased rates of chronic bronchitis, mortality from lung cancer and heart disease. The standard for PM 2.5 levels is 60 microgram per cubic metre./""It is true that Delhi is reeling under very poor air quality. But in terms of concentration of pollutants, we are doing far better than Beijing which has declared emergency conditions because of their air quality. Our PM 10 (coarse particles) and PM 2.5 are both high but not extreme. High PM 10 levels in Delhi can be attributed to road and construction dust while high PM 2.5 levels in Delhi can be attributed to incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass,"" said Gufran Beig, chief project scientist at SAFAR./Several air pollution experts and environment ministry officials sought clarification from IITM on whether Delhi had poorer air than Beijing. Scientists claim that one of the reasons why there could have been a misunderstanding about Delhi's air quality is because the hourly values are often not representative of the 24 hour average. ""What matters is the exposure of well-mixed ambient air on a longer period,"" said Sunil Peshin from Indian meteorological department./However, there is no doubt about the fact that Delhi's air quality is one of the poorest in the world and that emissions in the capital/are on a steady rise. TOI had reported on Monday how PM 2.5 emissions, which were 94.26 Gg/year in 2010, had increased to 107.5 Gg/year by 2013. This increasing trend was particularly seen over Rajiv Chowk, Sansad Bhawan, India Gate, IGI airport, Okhla industrial area, Pragati Maidan, IP estate and Janakpuri./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Devil in the air: Pollution levels head north in Kochi,"KOCHI: Are you having a persistent dry cough or a cold that refuses to go away? Are repeated medications failing to give you relief? You could be just one of the many citizens facing this problem that the doctors say is an allergy. And it's not likely to go away soon, thanks to the rising air pollution in the city./Construction activity, including road and Metro works, has pushed up pollution levels across the city and its suburbs. This has kept doctors busy over the last few months despite December-January being normally considered a healthy time./The ambient air quality monitoring systems of the pollution control board (PCB) have been reporting figures which are well beyond the permitted levels. All the seven stations set up across the city and the greater Cochin area, including the industrial belt of Eloor and Udyogamandal, have recorded high levels of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM)./""There are a lot of dust particles in the air and when they remain suspended in the atmosphere without dissolving, it is an indication of pollution. The limit for such particulate matter is about 100 microgram per cubic meter (ug/m3). However, now we have been recording 120-150 microgram per cubic meter (ug/m3) on most days./This is more so because of the construction activity going on in several parts of the city and outskirts,"" said PCB's chief environmental engineer M S Mythili./The PCB's seven stations are at Methanam, Eloor-1; TCC, Eloor-II; Near south overbridge; Vyttila; Irumpanam; MG Road and Kalamassery./Pulmonologists say that there is definitely a spurt in the number of patients coming with respiratory ailments compared with earlier years.

Delhi Pollution Control Committee counters high pollution claim,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has countered claims that PM 2.5 (fine, respirable particles) pollution in Delhi is higher than in Beijing. Data shared by DPCC for January 2012, 2013 and 2014, suggests the average PM 2.5 levels this year didn’t exceed 300 micrograms per cubic metre, unlike some media reports claiming it exceeded 500./However, average PM 2.5 levels in Delhi were at least 3 to 5 times the standard. Such high levels, according to health advisories issued in Beijing, are “very unhealthy.” Strangely, despite such levels, Delhi government neither issues daily health advisories nor has it developed a health quality index. Delhi also doesn’t use a health advisory developed by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR)./The US Embassy in China has hourly twitter updates on PM 2.5 levels and its corresponding health warnings. Another private organization, in collaboration with the US embassy in China and the ministry of environmental protection in China, also publishes real-time data./Delhi government has been dragging its feet on a health advisory for over a year now. “We are not sure when it will start,” said Sandeep Mishra, member secretary, DPCC. Dr T K Joshi, director (projects) at Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health, who is one of the authors of Delhi’s health advisory says, “The elderly, those suffering from cardio-vascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and respiratory illnesses, children and pregnant women are most likely to suffer due to such high levels”./Delhi is yet to release its Second Generation Action Plan which will suggest actions to counter the post-CNG air pollution crisis./Centre for Science and Environment has done a rapid assessment of air pollution levels in Beijing and Delhi. According to them, PM 10 levels (coarse particles) in Delhi are nearly double that in Beijing. In case of PM 2.5 levels, continuous daily average in India from November 2013 to January 2014 shows average levels have been about 240 microgram per cubic metre, which is about four times higher than the Indian standard. During this period, the peak level was as high as 575 microgram per cubic metre in Delhi, but did not cross 400 microgram per cubic metre in Beijing./CSE’s analysis quoted a study by JNU which earlier reported a decline in the level of toxins like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) following the introduction of CNG, but now states levels have gone up again, due to more vehicles. They claim 39,780 cancer cases might occur due to lifetime inhalation and exposure to PAH concentrations./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Benzene in evening air health hazard for kids,"NEW DELHI: Doctors who have been monitoring air quality data for the last month suggest that the best time to take a stroll for those vulnerable to pollution-related diseases is around 2pm./This is because PM 10 (coarse) and PM 2.5 (fine, respirable particles) levels stabilize briefly around that time. However, they found that different pollutants dominate at different monitoring stations, for instance benzene levels were much higher than the standard near Mandir Marg while carbon monoxide levels were higher near Anand Vihar./According to this analysis by Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health (COEH), it may not be a good idea for children and senior citizens to step out late in the evening or very early in the morning, as pollution levels increase due to freight movement during this time. They also suggest that children shouldn’t step out after 8pm in areas where benzene levels are found to be high. “This is because benzene levels are higher when it’s cool. We monitored Delhi Pollution Control Committee’s data and found that benzene peaks after sunset. It is linked to certain kinds of blood cancer and can be extremely dangerous for children, the elderly and pregnant women,” said Dr T K Joshi, director (projects) at COEH. “High carbon monoxide levels can affect those with cardiac eschemic disease as the heart is deprived of adequate oxygen. Those with cardiovascular disease can be vulnerable to strokes,” said Joshi./COEH’s brief analysis may reflect only a part of the health crisis Delhiites may be facing. DPCC, which maintains annual data, doesn’t agree with COEH’s analysis that particulate pollution stabilizes briefly in the afternoon. According their annual data for 2013, benzene levels are marginally higher in Punjabi Bagh and Anand Vihar, where the annual average has been about 5.68 and 6 microgram per cubic metre. The annual standard is 5 microgram per cubic metre. However, at IGI airport, annual average benzene levels are as high as 50 microgram per cubic metre. “This is because our monitoring station runs parallel to the runway and fuel emissions cause high benzene levels,” says M George of DPCC’s air lab./“We have 24-hour data for PM 10 and PM 2.5 for several months. Peak levels last for a longer duration and are very high in the early morning and late evening. The conventional notion of levels peaking during heavy traffic is not the case in anymore. Benzene, even at trace levels can be extremely dangerous,” says Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of air pollution and clean transportation programme, at Centre for Science and Environment./Beijing doesn’t experience such extreme and long peaks, according to CSE data. However, in Delhi, we have no such mechanism. Anumita also said annual averages as presented by DPCC may not reflect real exposure to pollutants as the data gets evened out./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
New norms to bring uniformity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease care,"PUNE: New evidence-based guidelines will now help doctors at all levels to diagnose and manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - a progressive respiratory disease widely prevalent in the country - in a scientific manner./The guidelines, drafted by the Indian Chest Society and the National College of Chest Physicians of India, will bring about uniformity in detection and treatment of the disease and help create an effective database of disease burden./This was revealed at the two-day international conference on 'Insights and Management of COPD (ICONIC)', which concluded here on Sunday. The conference was organised by Pune-based Chest Research Foundation (CRF) along with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and endorsed by international institutions such as the American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society and Indian Chest Society. It aimed at creating an impactful awareness programme on COPD./The forum brought together experts across the healthcare industry, including physicians, public health policymakers and researchers, and spearheaded new directions for translational research and health policy change in India./""COPD is a significant public health problem in India. Although several international guidelines for diagnosis and management of the disease are available, there are a lot of gaps in recognition and management of COPD in India due to vast differences in availability and affordability of healthcare facilities across the country. The guidelines will help clear confusion and make assessment of the disease more effective,"" said Shyam Biswal, professor of environment health sciences and director of the Centre for Global Clean Air at Johns Hopkins University./Biswal said that the awareness level vis-à-vis the disease is low in India. ""Globally, the total literature published on COPD in form of research articles and papers is around 54,000. Less than one per cent of these are related to COPD in the Indian context.""/CRF director and senior chest physician Sundeep Salvi said, ""Apart from international literature, Indian studies were specifically analysed to arrive at simple and practical recommendations. The evidence is presented under five headings - definitions, epidemiology, and disease burden; disease assessment and diagnosis; pharmacologic management of stable COPD; management of acute exacerbations; and nonpharmacologic and preventive measures. Dissemination of these guidelines at all levels of healthcare is now a challenge.""/""In India, everyone is aware of diseases such as cancer, diabetes and hypertension, but a disease like COPD still remains an unheard of condition for many. The disease is the second leading cause of death in the country and a major cause of morbidity. Due to lack of awareness among healthcare providers, it remains poorly diagnosed and treated. With little emphasis on prevention, COPD remains a largely neglected public health problem,"" Salvi said./""A chain smoker or a healthy common man does not know that a disease called 'COPD' exists. People smoke tobacco, burn mosquito coils, cook on 'chulhas' and live in a polluted environment without recognising that they are continuously being exposed to a non-treatable disease,"" he added./Keshav Desiraju, secretary in the Union ministry of health and family welfare, addressed the delegates on the first day of the conference on Saturday. He, too, underlined the need to draft a national programme for control of COPD in the country on the lines of those for other communicable and non-communicable diseases./BOX: COPD: The new definition/* Till date, there is no single satisfactory definition of this common disease. Different definitions given by various organisations have focused on common features of COPD/* The definition endorsed by the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease in its latest edition is comprehensive and elaborate, but complex/* Retaining the key components of various definitions and using simple terms, the newly drafted guidelines recommend the following definition of COPD:/""Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is a common, preventable lung disorder characterised by progressive, poorly reversible airflow limitation often with systemic manifestations, in response to tobacco smoke and/or other harmful inhalation exposures.""/BOX/What is the economic impact of COPD ?/* The estimated economic loss in India due to COPD is about Rs. 35,000 crores for year 2011 and is predicted to exceed Rs. 48,000 crores for year 2016./* These economic losses are more than the annual budget of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) for year 2010-2011, which was Rs. 25,124 crores./* In a study that assessed the costs of treatment amongst 423 COPD patients in India, it was found that patients spent 15% of their annual income on smoking products and 30% on disease management./* It has been calculated that proper program-based or guideline-based management of COPD can reduce these costs by approximately 70%./BOX: When to suspect COPD?/* It is one of the important differential diagnoses in patients presenting with symptoms of chronic cough, sputum production, breathlessness, and/or wheezing/* A diagnosis of COPD should be considered in persons who have these symptoms chronically, especially those with prolonged exposure to risk factors for the disease/BOX: Recommendations/* Tobacco smoking is the most well-established risk factor for COPD./* Both smokeless and smoking forms of tobacco are associated with serious health hazards, although only smoking tobacco is primarily responsible for COPD/* 'Bidi' and other indigenous forms of tobacco smoking are at least as (or even more) harmful than cigarette smoking/* Low tar or filtered cigarettes are not less harmful/* There is no minimum number of cigarettes/'bidi' per day below which the risk for COPD decreases/* Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is a definite risk factor for COPD, while exposure to biomass fuel smoke is a strong risk factor/* There is limited data on the association of ambient air pollution and COPD, and its causative role in the disease needs further evaluation/* There is insufficient evidence to attribute a/n etiological/role to pulmonary tuberculosis in causing COPD/* A subgroup of chronic asthma may clinically behave like COPD.

Battery autos renew green transport hope,"KOLKATA: They are noise-free and don't emit smoke. Even though slightly bigger in size, these new fleet of autos can ferry four to six passengers. Apart from being environment-friendly, they are more profitable for operators than their existing three-wheeled counterparts in the city. With the launch of the battery-operated electronic autorickshaws on Friday, Kolkata took a step towards green transport./Billed as an alternative to the polluting autos, the new three-wheelers are already running successfully in Delhi. Priced between Rs 60,000 and Rs 1,20,000, they are cheaper than a LPG auto and generate more revenue for the operators, claimed Zafar Faridi, CEO of Dianzi Enterprises that launched the vehicles./""For a daily expense of Rs 25, the operator can get a return of up to Rs 800-1000 a day. This is much higher compared to the meagre Rs 200-300 that auto operators earn a day now. The three-wheelers can ply long distances and can be driven for 12 hours a day. The batteries can be recharged easily and the cost of maintenance is low,"" said Faridi./Green activist Subhas Datta, who was present at the launch, said the vehicles had two big advantages that made them worth using. ""First, these autos don't emit smoke for they run on batteries. Secondly, they are noise-free. When we talk about pollution, we tend to ignore sound pollution. But it must be remembered that the noise level in Kolkata is far higher than the recommended 65 decibels. As far as air pollution is concerned, we are still taking the initial steps. We have just switched to LPG-fuelled autos, but polluting vehicles are still plying freely in Kolkata,"" said Datta. He added that if the electronic rickshaws had the back-up of an efficient after-sales service, they could run parallely with the autos. ""I have used them in Delhi and was quite impressed. This could pave the way for more green transport in Kolkata,"" said Datta./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Diseases on the rise as weather springs a surprise,"GUWAHATI: ""Nothing is so beautiful as spring"", wrote Gerard Manley Hopkins. However, for a lot of people, spring comes with its own share of problems./The vagaries of weather are combined with a rise in air pollution during the season. Toxins like carcinogenic benzene and industrial and vehicular dioxins affect people with chronic lung ailments and the level of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) in Assam goes beyond the permissible limit of 150 micrograms per cubic meter at this time, every year./""Guwahati is one of the most polluted cities. With rapid and unplanned urbanization, the city has become difficult to live in. Emissions from vehicles and deforestation have made it worse. It is time for us to reflect and take serious steps to improve the air we breathe in,"" said Hrishikesh Bora, a medicine consultant./Rains and a sudden drop in temperature since Friday have compounded the city's woes. According to the local met office, the maximum temperature in the city on Saturday was 18.6 degree Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.3 degree Celsius. Met officials added that the sudden dip in temperature was caused by a cyclonic circulation in the lower atmosphere over Assam and Meghalaya and the chill is likely to last till Monday./The transition from winter to spring exacerbates upper respiratory tract infections, diarrhoea-related diseases, bronchitis allergies and viral exanthems, said Bora, adding that children are vulnerable to chicken pox and measles at this time./""It is advisable that people take precautionary measures. Considering the sudden changes in weather, it is best if people keep warm clothes handy. Both children and adults should avoid exposure to cold. I examined 10 patients recently who were suffering from symptoms of weather ailments,"" said Bora./The unpredictable weather conditions, expected to continue till the onset of Bihu, will make life difficult for those afflicted with HIV and other immunological disorders./""Hygiene and vaccination are very important.

Anupanadi residents target polluting company,"MADURAI: A group of residents from Anupanadi thronged the district collectorate on Monday urging the state government and the district administration to act against a polluting company functioning in their area. The protesters, who were led by councillor of ward no 57 G Kadharammal, alleged that the company is depleting huge amount of ground water, besides causing air pollution./The protesters arrived at the collectorate with mud smeared on their whole body. The houses near the company are blanketed by dust rising from the company, they said. The company is engaged in making concrete mixture using cement and blue metal./In a petition submitted to the collector, the area councillor said that UDB Project Private Limited is depleting ground water as it draws water through one-feet wide borewell. It is acting against the rules and regulations and contribute to water scarcity in the nearby areas./Although the councillor had raised the issue in the corporation council meeting recently, no action was taken by the corporation. District collector should intervene and initiate action against the private company, Kadharammal urged./S Mohan, a resident of Anupanadi, said two natural water bodies in their area are chief sources of water. A few years ago TNHB had constructed residential houses in one of the water bodies, whereas the other is now encroached by the private company, he claimed./""The residents near the company are suffering from smoke and dust frequently emerging from the company. The entire area is getting polluted by the company situated amidst the dense residential area,"" Mohan added./""We are getting salty water as ground water is depleted. While corporation is providing drinking water only once in four days we are left to suffer.

Minister delinks illness from air pollution,"NEW DELHI: Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad has claimed that there is “no conclusive information” available with Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) regarding high prevalence of respiratory or other diseases caused by air pollution./Azad was replying to a question in Parliament on February 18. However, a large-scale study sponsored by CPCB and conducted by Kolkata’s Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute indicated that air pollution compromised lung function of children in Delhi./“Clearly, this official denial of mounting evidence, both locally and globally, is holding up action against air pollution in the country and aggravating public health risk,” said Anumita Roychowdhury of Centre for Science an Environment (CSE). Roychowdhury quoted Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 report which estimated that 6,20,000 premature deaths occur in India from air pollution-related diseases each year. This is six-fold increase from 1,00,000 deaths in 2000. In 2013, World Health Organization classified outdoor air pollution to be carcinogenic./Pulmonologists and chest medicine experts were shocked at the minister’s comments. According to Dr Arup Kumar Basu, chairperson of department of chest medicine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, there are umpteen studies that correlate respiratory illnesses with air pollution./“There are very eloquent studies done in Bangalore that have compared OPD visits for respiratory problems with the increase in automobile registrations. It has exponential curve. There is a clear relationship between childhood asthma and high levels of sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and suspended particulate matter (SPM) from diesel vehicles,” said Basu. SPM levels more than 10 PPM, for instance, are linked to conditions of the upper airways./Basu noticed respiratory illnesses increase during winter when the air is calm and SPM levels are high near the ground level. “The hot air in summer is like a honeymoon period for patients in Delhi because they gradually recover. But in winter, ICU admissions go up. I think the minister can say what he thinks but there is not much doubt that these illnesses are increasing because of air pollution,” he stated./The minister also said in his reply that Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBHI) has no information on the number of cases and deaths due to air pollution in India. As for action to deal with air pollution-related diseases he said, “The government is implementing National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) for prevention and control of various diseases.”/Experts like Sarath Guttikunda, director, urbanemissions.info said he wouldn’t take the minister’s comment seriously. “There are plenty of studies both international and Indian that suggest that respiratory illnesses because of air pollution are increasing. Impact of air pollution in the form of respiratory illnesses, cardiac conditions on pregnant women and children is well documented. In the late 2000’s for instance Public Health and Air Pollution in Asia (PAPA) program conducted studies on impact of air pollution in Delhi and Chennai,” he said./Shreekant Gupta, an academic also said that there is inconvertible evidence that air pollution impacts health. “CPCB’s own data shows PM 2.5 (fine, respirable particles) to be way higher than the safe standard for breathing,” he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Britain’s monarch breathing the country’s most polluted air,"LONDON: Britain’s monarch is exposed to the worst air pollution in Britain. Days after the European Commission dragged UK to Court over high pollution levels it has been found that the traffic ridden road that runs alongside the Queen’s London home Buckingham Palace has the country’s highest levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a toxic gas that comes mostly from traffic fumes./Eighty-seven-year-old Queen Elizabeth II is living in a palace where NO2 levels were almost four times the European legal limit./Air pollution causes 29,000 early deaths a year in the UK–more than twice as many per year as were caused by passive smoking before the ban. The World Health Organization has confirmed that air pollution causes cancer. Poor air quality also causes heart attacks and children living near busy roads in the UK have been shown to grow up with underdeveloped lungs./EU says that levels of nitrogen dioxide, mainly from diesel engines, are excessive in many British cities./The UK Supreme Court has already declared that air pollution limits are regularly exceeded in 16 zones across the UK./The areas affected are Greater London, the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, Teesside, the Potteries, Hull, Southampton, Glasgow, the East, the South East, the East Midlands, Merseyside, Yorkshire & Humberside, the West Midlands, and the North East. The Court also noted that air quality improvement plans estimate that for London compliance with EU standards will only be achieved by 2025, 15 years after the original deadline, and in 2020 for the other 15 zones./The latest figures, released by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), show some of London’s top tourist attractions are also blighted by some of the country’s most polluted roads./A section of Oxford Street near Marble Arch registered an annual average NO2 reading of 150 micrograms per cubic metre of air, the second-highest in the country./Four sections of Marylebone Road, including near Madame Tussauds, were among the 50 locations in the UK—all of them in London—with the highest NO2 readings, along with Regent Street outside Hamleys, the toy shop./Nitrogen dioxide is the main pre-cursor for ground-level ozone causing major respiratory problems and leading to premature death./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
BMC to foot gas bills of Mumbai's private crematoriums,"MUMBAI: To promote eco-friendly measures, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to foot gas bills of private Hindu crematoriums in the city./The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has taken a policy decision to replace all crematoriums in the city into CNG or PNG crematoriums, as these fuels are cleaner, eco-friendly and cheaper. On the lines of free of cost supply of wood, the civic body will also bear the cost of CNG or PNG supply at these crematoriums./According to the civic officials, using wood to burn bodies adds to deforestation. Moreover, smoke emitting from pyres is a big cause of pollution. The residents living in the vicinity of the crematorium have complained that the smoke generated due to burning of wood polluted the air and caused respiratory problems. The CNG or PNG crematorium will be effective in reducing the air pollution./The standing committee on Wednesday cleared a proposal to reimburse gas supply bills of three private Hindu crematoriums – Ghatkopar (East) Rs 3.50 lakh, Mulund (West) Rs seven lakh and Banganga Rs 3.50 lakh./According to the civic officials, the BMC spends Rs 2000 per every funeral for funeral in the private crematoriums by using firewood. However, the use of CNG will drastically bring down this expenditure as the funeral needs only Rs 630./A senior civic official said, ""The private crematoriums should fulfil certain conditions to avail free gas supply from the BMC. The trust running the private Hindu crematoriums should install and maintain gas pyres on their own. There should be a separate gas connection for the pyre.""/There are total 182 crematoriums in the city, of which 125 belongs to the civic body, while 46 are private.

How technology can fix 6 big problems of India,"Over the next three decades, assuming business as-usual situations, some of our most intractable problems will gradually worsen and become extremely difficult to handle, causing severe disruptions to life and business. For example, climate change and population increase will stretch thin our natural resources. Rising pollution and increasing waste will affect the health of people and the liveability of our cities. Other global problems will cross borders and aggravate an already-serious situation. All our big problems are global in nature, but they will be seen at their worst behaviour in a tropical country like India./There are many different waysto reduce the impact of big problems. Using advanced technology is the most powerful of these methods, as most big problems are not solvable within reasonable time periods and costs without technology inputs. Some of our problems are so difficult that we would need major technology breakthroughs for their solution within a generation or two. Here's a list of six problems that will disrupt life and economic growth of the country, and some ideas on how they can be tackled./Networked healthcare/The innovation: Healthcare technology is undergoing a big revolution. On one side, genomics is revolutionising our understanding of disease. On the other, the delivery of healthcare is getting a substantial makeover due to technology. We can hope that our improved understanding of biology will result in new drugs for killer diseases over the next decade, much of it tailored to specific individuals. But new healthcare delivery technologies will have a big impact on our lives even if we do not get many new drugs in the near future./Companies around the world are developing networked devices for continuous monitoring of health. Driven partly by individuals and partly by hospitals, new networked devices are set to bring about a revolution in the treatment of chronic diseases by catching them early. Hospitals, which were built for acute care, are keen to use this technology and extend their reach into the home. Networked devices will let hospitals monitor patients when they are away, and recommend interventions when a serious problem is imminent. Indian hospitals are already preparing for this change, which will be one of the biggest in the last century./Providing food for everybody/The innovations: As our crop yields decline due to frequent extreme weather, genomics technologies can help increase yield by 20-30%. Genetic engineering can produce crops that can tolerate extreme temperatures. Extensive use of information technology can reduce water and fertiliser use in farms, and robots - called farmbots - can reduce back-breaking work. Smart technologies - driven by sensor networks - can fine tune our food supply chains and cut down waste significantly./There are a few potential game changers on the horizon. One of them is urban farming, involving techniques like hydroponics or aeroponics, which anchor plants in water or air and not in the soil. An extreme form of urban farming is the so-called vertical farm, which grows plants in controlled environments inside buildings./Clean water for all/The innovations: Water shortage is primarily caused by human activity, and so it is natural to assume that humans can solve it without much difficulty. Some of our purported technology solutions — like big dams and linking of rivers — have serious environmental impact. For example, it can help improve efficiency by monitoring our usage closely. Toilets of tomorrow will use considerably less or even no water (40% of water in homes is used for flushing). Newer technologies in industry will use dramatically less water. And so on./While all these things will reduce per capita water use substantially, they will not increase its availability. Desalination is being proposed as a good way to increase availability. This technique has some way to go before becoming environment friendly and energy efficient. The best method now seems to be storage, especially underground storage, either by recharging aquifers or underground dams. Underground water storage has its own problems like contamination and toxic metal leakage, but these are solvable. In the long run, it will work well along with desalination and water conservation./Generating energy at low costs/The innovations: Among all our problems, our inability to produce energy in a sustainable way seems to be the most intractable. Although it is possible on paper to produce all our energy from renewable sources, the costs are prohibitive. A big switch to renewables would also need substantial re-engineering of our industries. Which is why most projections posit only small and gradual increases in the share of renewables in our energy mix. Big technology breakthroughs over the decade can change this./Solar energy will get better, and emerging grid storage technologies will let us use it at night, too. In the long-run, the only low-carbon energy source seems to be nuclear energy. Third and fourth generation nuclear energy technologies are safer and far more environment friendly than the current second generation ones. However, the number of nuclear plants around the world is predicted to decrease in future. By mid-century, perhaps, fusion energy would solve the energy problem forever./Giving quality education/The innovations: For over a millennium, till the end of the 20th century, the education sector has not changed much from a technology point of view. The big technology revolutions of the last few centuries have passed by the education sector, with only printing making a significant impact. Technology is now remaking the education sector and causing disruptions to business models globally. It is difficult to predict how things will change over a decade or two, but most experts are of the view that education will go through a disruptive change within a decade./Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are only part of the story. In the near future, technology and attitudinal changes will force major universities to open new campuses — physical or virtual — around the world. Technology will allow universities to identify candidates remotely with as much accuracy as in a proctored examination. Students will learn from anywhere at any time, with highly-individualised curriculum and low costs. This will improve access to higher education. In some areas, motivated students can work around lack of adequate access to world-class institutions of higher learning./Make our cities liveable/The innovations: Improvements in technology can solve some of city problems gradually. Traffic pollution, for example, can be controlled only through better public transport and emission standards. Over several decades, cleaner fuel and an increasing proportion of electric vehicles can bring down air pollution gradually. Modern waste management techniques allow the disposal of solid waste with minimal use of landfills./Although these work gradually over time, smart technologies will add an edge to managing cities. Sensor networks and analytics will combine to provide information about water usage, traffic patterns, accidents, fires and so on. They can be used even to improve education and healthcare or prevent crime. Over the years, smart technologies will make one big difference to the city: it will let us understand how our cities work./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Major hair issues men face,"Let's accept it, even men need hair care and they also need to address their hair issues. Here are three main issues and how to handle them./Here are the main issues men can face when it comes to hair and how to best handle the issues./Thinning:/Thinning hair can be a serious issue as it would mean not all hairstyles will work for you. Go to a good stylist as they usually know what works best for thinning hair. The best is to keep your hair short. This will ensure there is no further hair loss. Due to air pollution, hair can take a beating, so use a good shampoo to them in good health. It always helps./Dandruff:/Dandruff is yet another major problem area. This could be because of bad hair care or over doing hair grooming products. Try to strike the right balance and oil your hair regularly, but make sure you do not go overboard with the hair oil as oily scalp can also lead to dandruff. Your diet also plays an important role in keep a good scalp. So make sure you are eating healthy./Hair loss:/While hair loss is a natural phenomenon and it happens as you age, but losing hair before time is one thing a lot of urban males face these days. And one of the major reason is unhealthy lifestyle, smoking, and pollution. Apart from that carelessness in taking care of hair can also lead to untimely hair loss.

"Air pollution biggest health risk, says WHO","LONDON: Air pollution has emerged as the world’s single largest environmental health risk, having caused seven million deaths in 2012 — 80% of which were from heart attacks and stroke./The WHO announced on Tuesday that 1 in 8 global deaths were linked with air pollution. It recently categorized outdoor air pollution — caused by car exhausts, power stations, emissions from agriculture and industry as well as heating in people’s homes — as a Group 1 carcinogenic, a cancer causing agent in the same category as tobacco smoke, UV radiation and plutonium. World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) said there was “sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans”./Six per cent of these deaths were due to lung cancer caused by both outdoor and indoor air pollution. This is the first time that WHO has directly suggested a link between air pollution and heart disease, respiratory problems and cancer. This finding more than doubles previous estimates of deaths caused by air pollution./Regionally, low- and middle-income countries in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions had the largest air pollution-related burden in 2012, with a total of 3.3 million deaths linked to indoor air pollution and 2.6 million deaths related to outdoor air pollution. “Cleaning up the air we breathe prevents non communicable diseases as well as reduces disease risks among women and vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly,” says Dr Flavia Bustreo, WHO assistant director-general family, women and children’s health. “Poor women and children pay a heavy price from indoor air pollution since they spend more time at home breathing in smoke and soot from leaky coal and wood cook stoves.” After analysing the risk factors, WHO estimated that indoor air pollution was linked to 4.3 million deaths in 2012 in households cooking over coal, wood and biomass stoves. The new estimate is explained by better information about pollution exposures among the estimated 2.9 billion people living in homes using wood, coal or dung as their primary cooking fuel, as well as evidence about air pollution’s role in the development of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and cancers./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Ludhiana worries over its PM,"LUDHIANA: The price of being a prosperous, industrial city could be a few years of residents' lives, so says a paper by a Harvard professor./According to Rohini Pande, professor of public policy and author of the paper, the data is based on ambient air quality measured by SPM (suspended particulate matter) in 180 Indian cities. She said the level of pollution in Ludhiana is twice the national standard and more than six times the standard recommended by World Health Organization. Ludhiana has 60 micrograms per cubic metre of SPM as compared to WHO recommendation of 25 micrograms per cubic metre./According to WHO figures of 2011, Ludhiana was the most polluted city in India with 251 micrograms per cubic metre of particulate matter (PM10) followed by Kanpur (209) and Delhi (198)./""According to the data with us, Ludhiana looks pretty polluted. Our data isn't good enough to provide city-specific estimates of life expectancy loss but it is relevant to note that pollution in Ludhiana is double the national average, which gave us life loss of 3.3 years. According to the Pollution Control Board report for the city, it seems like a case of pollution largely from stationary small and medium industries"", Pande told The Times of India. Pande suggests public private Initiatives and installation of continuous pollution monitoring devices to improve air quality./For doctors in the city, Pande's paper does not come as a surprise. ""High level of air pollution is leading to respiratory problems among city residents, including COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease), asthma and lung cancer, which do lead to death. During the last 10 years, the number of patients with respiratory problems has risen three times. As air pollution affects the respiratory system, immunity suffers, which makes a person prone to diseases. Ailments also have an impact on life expectancy"", said Dr Gurpreet Singh, senior consultant in pulmonary medicine, SPS Apollo Hospital. As for residents, the downward slide in health is evident. Take the case of Vineet Kumar, 28, a software professional from Civil Lines, who worked in Bangalore for a few years. He did not have any respiratory problem in the southern city. But months after he arrived in Ludhiana, he had respiratory problems, including coughing, shortness of breath and watery eyes./Surjeet Singh, a 45-year-old businessman from BRS Nagar started having frequent attacks of asthma about a decade ago. A pulmonary specialist told him high pollution levels triggered asthma. Although Singh has been taking precautions, his condition has not improved much./According to specialists, while no study has been conducted on the impact of high pollution level on life expectancy in the study, but the fact is that high level of pollution does affect life expectancy if preventive steps are not taken./Dr Jagdeep Whig, a city-based chest specialist said minute particles in the air enter the lungs and cause respiratory diseases, decreasing lung capacity and affecting immunity in the long run. ""As high level of air pollution results in frequent health problems, we expect life expectancy to come down"", he said./Talking about the cases being reported in hospitals, Dr Gurpreet Singh of SPS Apollo Hospital said, ""We are frequently getting cases of intractable cough even among young patients. Although X-Ray and other tests suggest that chest is clear, even then the patient coughs a lot. This is the result of high pollution level, which has led to asthma, COPD and other problems even among young patients""./For environmental activists, this is cause for serious concern. They want the PPCB to act against industrial units pumping pollutants into the air. ""Many studies suggest that our city is one of the most polluted in the world. In the absence of proper checks, industries are spewing huge quantities of suspended particles in the air. Corrective steps need to be taken before the quality of life in the city deteriorates further"", Amandeep Singh Bains, an environmental activist of the city./MC estimates suggests there are around 10 lakh plants and trees in the city, which has a population of around 16 lakh, as recorded in the 2011 census./Harbeen Singh, senior environmental engineer (SEE), PPCB, said, ""A human with a life span of 50 to 60 years needs 50 to 100 plants and trees for healthy living. If the number of trees for 16 persons is just 10 in the city, it is very less.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Wrong notions weakening fight against asthma,"NAGPUR: Misconceptions always have a way of restricting the benefits of science. This is true in case of people's belief regarding the chronic respiratory disease asthma. One thought process which is widely prevalent in the country is 'Dama dum ke saath hi jata hai' or 'Asthma ends with life'./Such notions only lead to cases of the disease being under diagnosed or undertreated. It is estimated that asthma accounts for about one in every 250 deaths worldwide. Many of the deaths - that take place due to low quality long-term medical care and delay in obtaining help during the final attack - are preventable, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO)./""Sometimes, people with the above kind of thought process believe that medicines would not help them much. Some believe that if not developed during childhood, one can never have asthma, or even that if developed during childhood it would get healed on its own during the child's adolescence,"" said pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat, the president of Vidarbha Chest Association. He said sometimes overprotective, urban parents tend to think of a child with asthma as being handicapped so often that the doctors tell them the scientific names of the disease and not referring to it as asthma./Among the many misbelieves about the disease and its treatment is that inhalers are addictive. ""It is partly because of ideas like these as well as the apparent awkwardness of using them in front of others that make so many patients hesitant to use inhalers. Many even ask us whether they can do without it, not realizing that it is an important part of the primary treatment,"" said chest physician Dr Rajesh Ballal. He also said that patients often put dietary restrictions on themselves that end up doing more harm than good./Chest physician Dr Rajesh Swarnakar said though it is true that asthma has no permanent cure and as such is a chronic ailment, its symptoms can be largely alleviated with proper medication and treatment. ""If this is done, an asthmatic patient can lead a normal, active and healthy life. Suffering from the symptoms of a disease without doing anything about it is not normal. It is also dangerous to use medication that provides only short term relief,"" he said. He added that patients need to be made aware that present day treatment ensures that 'dama ke karan dum aur kham nahi jayega'./Curious case of asthma/Misconceptions and facts -/M: Dama dum ke saath hi jata hai/F: The disease can be managed through medication and care/M: Asthma only starts in childhood/F: Asthma symptoms can appear at any time in life.

The dose of medicine (steroids) in an inhaler is low so that even if taken when not having an attack, no side effects are experienced. Also, such low doses can hardly be habit forming./M: Sour foodstuff or dairy products must not be consumed by asthmatic patients, since it is a respiratory disease/F: Such dietary restrictions don't affect the patients usually. However, low intake of sour foods can mean lower consumption of vitamin C which may aggravate allergies.

"'Right treatment saves asthmatics', say experts","TRICHY: Respiratory diseases like asthma are on the rise due to rising air pollution. And, experts say that even if prevention is not possible, judicious treatment can extend the lifespan of the asthmatics./""Prevention of asthma is difficult due to increasing air pollution, industrial activities and indiscriminate burning of wastes. Smokers are prone to allergic disorders,"" Dr Mathwesh, chief medical superintendent of the Railway Hospital said ./The hospital on Tuesday conducted a programme at the Trichy railway station to promote awareness about the precautions to be taken to ward off asthma on the occasion of World Asthma Day. Dr Mathwesh also said that drug therapy and use of equipment can make life comfortable for patients./A paediatric pulmonologist at the Tamil Nadu Ashthma Allergy Research Centre said regular breathing exercise can prevent asthma. ""People who are constantly exposed to air pollution are prone to asthma. A breathing exercise comprising slow and deep breathing can strengthen the lungs to resist asthma,"" said Dr G Kamal at the centre./Dr Kamal added that the mortality rate of asthmatics is on the rise in India. ""Around 57,000 patients succumb to asthma in our country due to discontinuation of treatment and unavailability of emergency care. At present, around 300 million people are affected by asthma world over. It is estimated that the number will rise further if the present situation continues,"" said Dr Kamal, while urging asthma patients to follow the treatment course without fail./The Child Rights Commission also played a role in raising awareness about the respiratory problem. ""Children ape others. We should teach them cleanliness and ensure that they maintain self-cleanliness for good health. Moreover, children can contract respiratory diseases due to unhygienic eating practices,"" said Dr T Jayanthirani, a member of the State Commission for Protection for Child Rights.

Delhi air worst in the world,"NEW DELHI: Delhi has the most polluted air in the world. A World Health Organization (WHO) air quality database of 1,600 cities and 91 countries released on Wednesday shows that the concentration of PM2.5 (fine, respirable particles) is the highest in Delhi at 153 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) when the WHO standard is just about 10µg/m³. The fine, particulate pollution which is considered most dangerous for health is way higher in Delhi compared with many other crowded Asian cities, including Beijing which has a PM2.5 level of 56µg/m³, Karachi (117µg/m³) and Shanghai (36µg/m³)./The concentration of PM10 (coarse particles) in Delhi is about 286µg/m³, more than 14 times higher than the WHO annual mean standard of 20. Peshawar (540µg/m³) and Rawalpindi (448µg/m³) in Pakistan fare worse on this parameter. Indian cities with a very high PM10 level include Gwalior, Raipur and Lucknow./This is not the first time Delhi has earned the dubious distinction of having extremely polluted air. In January, Yale University's Environmental Performance Index 2014 had ranked India among the bottom five in a list of 178 countries for various parameters, including air pollution. A controversy erupted when the Yale data was interpreted to mean that Delhi's air quality is worse than Beijing's. The Delhi government and the ministry of earth sciences, which monitors air pollution data for the city, had vehemently denied this. But the latest WHO database suggests that Beijing probably has better control systems in place to deal with air pollution./""WHO has not ranked cities but its database gives us an idea of where we stand. Delhi is more polluted than others. WHO has compared our annual mean levels with its standards, which are far lower than Indian standards. The database highlights what a major public health issue air pollution is and how aggressive our policies need to be,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, air pollution expert with Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). India's annual mean standard for PM10 is 60µg/m³ and for PM2.5 it is about 40µg/m³./High PM2.5 levels are associated with major health effects. WHO in its statement said: ""High concentrations of small and fine particulate pollution is particularly associated with high numbers of deaths from heart disease and stroke, as well as respiratory illnesses and cancers. Measurement of fine particulate matter of 2.5 micrometres or less in diameter (PM2.5) is considered to be the best indicator of the level of health risks from air pollution""./Dr Maria Neira, WHO director for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health said, ""Cities such as Copenhagen and Bogotà have improved air quality by promoting 'active transport' and prioritizing dedicated networks of urban public transport, walking and cycling""./Only 12% of the people living in cities get air quality conforming to WHO guidelines.

Rajasthan's five cities have poor air quality: Report,"JAIPUR: The World Health Organization's (WHO) air quality database of 1,600 cities in different countries shows Delhi as most polluted city, however, the situation in five big cities of Rajasthan is also not very encouraging. The WHO’s air quality database of 1,600 cities in 91 countries also covered Rajasthan’s five prominent cities — Jaipur, Jodhpur, Alwar, Udaipur and Kota./Among the five cities of Rajasthan, Jodhpur has the most polluted air. The WHO measured the concentration of PM2.5, which are quite fine and respirable particles. In comparison to Delhi, Jodhpur has relatively low concentration of PM2.5, which is measured in micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³). Delhi has 153 µg/m³, while Jodhpur has µg/m³ of PM2.5 concentration, but still it is well above the WHO’s standard, which is about µg/m³./However, the concentration of PM2.5 in Jaipur is µg/m³, it is second most air polluted city in the state, which were included in WHO’s air quality database./The cities in the state have concentration of industries and vehicles. SMS medical college’s former professor of medicine and former head division of allergy and pulmonary medicine Dr Virendra Singh said, “PM2.5 particles are very minute, as they easily enter the windpipe and lodge at the periphery of the windpipe. Such particles cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among the persons who are continuously exposed to such particles.”/According to the WHO report, the annual mean of concentration of PM2.5 is 59µg/m³ is in India. Jodhpur, Jaipur and Kota have concentration well above the annual mean in India, whereas Alwar has less concentration in comparison to annual mean of India. Alwar has 38µg/m³, while Kota and Udaipur have 64µg/m³ and 62µg/m³, respectively./As far as the concentration of PM10 (coarse particles) is concerned, Jodhpur has the highest concentration. It has 196µg/m³, while Jaipur 155 µg/m³, Kota 146 µg/m³, Udaipur 143 µg/m³ and Alwar has the lowest air pollution in comparison to other Rajasthan’s cities examined at 86 µg/m³./The particulate matter of less than 10 microns of diameter are (PM10), while of less than 2.5 microns are (PM2.5)./The WHO pointed out that air pollution consists of many pollutants, among other particulate matter. These particles are able to penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract and therefore constitute a risk for health by increasing mortality from respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and selected cardiovascular diseases./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Respiratory ailments spiral in Delhi,"NEW DELHI: World Health Organisation's data that indicates Delhi has the most polluted air in the world has confirmed what they have anecdotally known all along, say doctors in the city. They claim the deterioration in air quality has clearly been reflected in the number of patients with respiratory ailments and poor lung function, which has gone up several times over the past few years./In 2012, the statistical handbook released by the state government said that an average of 23 people die every day due to respiratory diseases in the capital. The number of cases, data showed, had doubled in the past four years. Doctors say worsening air quality, a major trigger for respiratory conditions such as chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and infections, may cause more fatalities in the coming years if appropriate measures are not taken./""The response to medicines has changed. Inhalers and nebulisers are proving ineffective in controlling symptoms of respiratory ailments. The number of emergency admissions, particularly among the elderly, has gone up too,"" says Dr Arup Basu, vice-chairman of pulmonology department at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. He says illnesses such as chronic bronchitis, cough and aggravation of asthma symptoms seen during change of season -onset of winter and summer season- are now observed throughout the year./""Usually, these infections go away in a week or two but due to environmental changes we are seeing a lot of patients complaining about these symptoms continuing for over a month despite medications ,"" adds the doctor. Dr A B Dey, professor and head of geriatric medicine at AIIMS, says exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pneumonia infections are reported throughout the year./It's not just respiratory diseases, but the decline in air quality is causing increase in the incidence of other health ailments, including rheumatic arthritis, heart failure and depression./""Incidence of autoimmune diseases, for example rheumatoid arthritis, has increased significantly which cannot be explained merely by citing genetic changes. The role of ambient air pollution, which is a known cause of aberration in the immune status of genetically predisposed individuals and even healthy ones, is being investigated,"" says Dr Uma Kumar, head of clinical immunology and rheumatology department at AIIMS.

India ranks among the world's worst for its polluted air: WHO,"LUCKNOW: The latest urban air quality database released by the World Health Organization (WHO) says that India ranks among the world’s worst for its polluted air. Out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world, 13 are in India. The report reconfirms that most Indian cities are soon becoming death traps because of very high air pollution levels./India appears among the group of countries with highest particulate matter (PM) levels. Also, its cities have the highest levels of PM10 and PM2.5 (particles with diameter of 10 microns and 2.5 microns) when compared to other cities. Delhi is among the most polluted cities in the world today./Director general, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), Sunita Narain says: “This database confirms our worst fears about how hazardous air pollution is in our region. Last year, the Global Burden of Disease study pinned outdoor air pollution as the fifth largest killer in India after high blood pressure, indoor air pollution, tobacco smoking, and poor nutrition. About 620,000 early deaths occurred in India due to air pollution-related diseases in 2010.”/Narain added that 18 million years of healthy lives are lost due to illness burden that enhances the economic cost of pollution. Half of these deaths have been caused by heart disease triggered by exposure to air pollution and the rest due to stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory track infection and lung cancer./Experts claim that Indian cities are witnessing a rapid increase in air pollution and untamed motorization. Cities need to curb pollution from all sources, but vehicles need special attention as they emit toxic fumes within our breathing zone. India needs urgent action to leapfrog vehicle technology and fuel quality, scale up public transport, reduce dependence on cars, and promote walking and cycling./India is waiting for a decision on the emissions standards roadmap for vehicles and fuel quality from the Auto Fuel Policy Committee under the chairmanship of Saumitra Chaudhury, member, Planning Commission. This is expected to be announced soon, before the UPA II government is dissolved. The committee must respond effectively to the mounting evidences on worsening air quality and health damages associated with vehicular fumes./CSE suggests that the entire country should leapfrog to Euro VI standards by 2020-21. All cities need to implement clean air action plan to curb pollution from all sources to meet clean air standards in a time bound manner. Also, government must inform people about the air quality on a daily basis and issue health alerts for especially children, elderly, and those suffering from respiratory and cardiac problems./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

WHO finds Nagpur air quality worsening,"NAGPUR: Nagpur is considered one of the greenest and cleanest cities in the country but the World Health Organization (WHO) points out all is not hunky-dory with the city's air quality. WHO's latest report on ambient (outdoor) air pollution in 1,600 cities it monitors worldwide shows significant and growing level of air pollution in Nagpur./WHO 2014 report released on Wednesday contains data from 1,600 cities in 91 countries. The report covers the period from 2008 to 2013, with a majority of values from 2011 & 2012. Air quality is represented by annual mean concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5 & PM10 - particles between 2.5 and 10 microns). WHO does not rank these cities or countries according to pollution levels but the report reflects the monitoring efforts undertaken in these countries. The report found that PM10 level in Nagpur was 118 micrograms per cubic metre in 2012-13. It is a cause of concern as the same levels in 2008 was 98. The consolation is that it is still below the acceptable level of 140 as per national ambient air quality standards./Nagpur still compares favourably with most other Indian cities.The PM10 level in other major cities are Gwalior (329), Raipur (305), Delhi (286), Kanpur (212), Lucknow (219), Ludhiana (207), Chandrapur (174), Patna (164), Mumbai (136), and Pune (134). Only Amravati (97) has lower level than Nagpur. Though the levels may look alarming, WHO says the database primarily captures measurements from monitoring stations located in urban background, residential, commercial and mixed areas. The primary sources of data include publicly available national/sub-national reports and websites, regional networks and selected publications./The WHO report has attracted divergent views from green activists. Tushar Mandlekar of International Society for Road Transport and Saftey (ISRTS) said air pollution was a major factor with 14 lakh vehicles on city roads and 300 new vehicles hitting the streets daily. ""The authorities have no mechanism to check pollution from vehicles nor there is any action against polluting vehicles. This has worsened air pollution,"" said Mandlekar./Founder of Green Vigil Kaustubh Chatterjee said he wouldn't dismiss the report but it related to suspended particulate matter (SPM) only which was not the only air pollutant. ""It is an indicator of long-term air quality and health risks,"" Chatterjee said. He said the report had not taken into consideration other aspects like greenhouse gases, noise and water pollution, e-waste and solid waste. It also did not include industries./However, Shrikant Deshpande, who has filed a PIL against tree felling, said if current level of pollution is measured, the report would be more alarming. ""With greenery fading owing to large-scale tree felling for urbanization, air pollution levels in the city have gone up. You can feel it while moving on city roads. People are being exposed to increased risks of respiratory diseases,"" he claimed./Vidarbha Environment Action Group (VEAG) convener Sudhir Paliwal too warned that increasing air pollution levels were due to emissions from vehicles, burning of garbage and more due to power plants near the city. ""There is total neglect by various agencies on checking air pollution. People are exposed to health risks,"" Paliwal said./How was the study done/* The database contains measured outdoor air pollution levels relevant for estimating mean annual exposures of the urban population to fine particulate matter/* The database is of global scope, and aims to provide data at national and city levels/* Air quality that is largely representative for human exposure, urban measurement characterized as urban background, urban traffic, residential areas, commercial and mixed areas were used/* Stations characterized as particular 'hot spots' or exclusively industrial areas not included/* It was not possible to retrieve or use all publicly available data of interest owing to language barriers, or incomplete information on the data/* Search strategy included screening of websites and statistics/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Karnataka State Pollution Control Board fails to give sound solutions,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) was tasked with the job of finding solutions to the city's soaring decibel levels. In response to a high court directive, the board asked three departments — police, BBMP and transport — to deal with the issue. However, KSPCB's approach shows it has at best consulted rulebooks formulated decades ago, falling back on dated ways to a deal with a present-day concern./According to KSPCB directions, the police department just needs to stick to its job — regulate traffic to avoid jams and thus reduce sound and air pollution, take action against drivers honking unnecessarily, regulate use of loudspeakers, and so on./Similarly, BBMP has been directed to declare traffic junctions as no-honking zones and display signage, among other things. The transport department has been told to ensure vehicles are fitted only with authorized horn and silencers./Ironically, the solutions have been floated after three meetings of an inter-departmental committee comprising members from the three departments and the pollution control board. But what new came out of all the brainstorming? Nothing, really. The departments though say they have various plans in the pipeline to beat sound pollution./However, even before addressing the issue, the departments are ensuring they underline the efforts they've made to this end. While BBMP is browbeating about multi-level parking facilities at Freedom Park and Russell Market, a 250-km road network in the city, newer grade separators, skywalks et al, the police department points to its newly built traffic management centre and its awareness drives. The transport department, on its part, said it has booked 56,303 cases for defective silencers, shrill horn and black smoke emission during 2012-14./THE BACKGROUND/The Malleswaram Resident Welfare Association had filed a writ petition (WP No. 45881/2012) in the high court on sound pollution in Malleswaram.

They said animal skin, fur and secretions such as saliva, perfumes, cosmetics and eye make up may also cause conjunctivitis. Construction dust was also a major cause of allergic conjunctivitis. The perennial form persists throughout the year and is usually triggered by dust mites. In some cases, use of mosquito-repellent liquids used in a closed room throughout the night can cause allergies and puffy eyelids./They said it was very important to manage conjunctivitis in a person because it spreads rapidly from eyes to fingers of an infected person. From fingers it is transferred to any other object one touches such as door knobs, computer keyboard, cell-phone, or any object at all. Subsequently, when someone else touches the same object, the virus is transferred to the fingers and it goes on to infect his eyes when he touches them./City based ophthalmologist Dr V B Pratap said prevention is simple. ""All one needs to do is refrain from touching one's eye,"" he said, adding ""if you avoid touching eyes, you won't get this infection, no matter how widespread it may be in the city. We need to create awareness among people that it is very simple to keep it away. Just avoid touching your eyes.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Heat, emissions raise Delhi's ozone levels","NEW DELHI: Air pollution is once again at worrying levels in the capital. But this time it is not particulate matter but ground-level ozone, associated with severe health impacts, that has breached the safe limit./On Friday, the average ozone level went over 71 parts per billion in Lodhi Road and Delhi University, compared to the standard of 50ppb. Interestingly, ozone levels are way higher around certain monitoring stations than others. Scientists say these spots could be experiencing the urban heat island effect where a mix of soaring temperatures, built-up area and emissions from various sources like traffic cause ozone levels to go up./This ozone is different from stratospheric ozone that protects the earth from harmful ultra-violet rays. The ground-level ozone that's currently wreaking havoc in certain parts of Delhi is created due to chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOX), volatile organic compounds (VOC) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the presence of sunlight and heat./Sources of NOX and VOCs are usually industrial facilities, motor vehicle exhausts, power plants and others. Ozone levels are usually measured in eight-hourly averages (during daylight) and hourly averages. When Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology under ministry of earth sciences calculated the average for eight-hourly averages from May 11 to May 20, ozone levels were significantly high around Delhi University and Lodhi road. The temperature during this phase has been hovering around 40-43 degrees. Hourly average of ozone at 2 pm at these two spots peaked to about 103ppb on Thursday and Friday when the standard for hourly average is 90ppb./""The variability of ozone levels is very high in Delhi. Certain areas are more affected than others which is why we are calling them urban heat islands. The temperature in these areas is also possibly higher than other parts of the city,"" said Gufran Beig, chief project scientist at System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), IITM./Every summer between April and June, ozone levels go up in Delhi. ""We see a clear trend of ozone levels rising around this time every year. Ozone has an immediate effect on people suffering from asthma. Which is why ozone levels are always given as part of smog alerts as school children and vulnerable population need to aware of it and stay indoors if required. Ozone is the only gas which has two sets of standards-hourly and eight hourly because high levels of ozone can have very serious health impacts,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, head of the clean air programme at Centre for Science and Environment./Last year the eight-hourly average for ozone had peaked to 80-85ppb according to records with IITM. This year, too, ozone levels may increase next month./This toxic gas which is ""temperature dependent"" according to scientists can have a slew of health impacts. It is associated with breathing difficulty, coughing, and sore throat, aggravate lung disease like chronic bronchitis, increased frequency of asthma attacks, damage lungs says environment protection agency./Many urbanized parts of US and Europe are known to suffer due to high ozone levels. While PM2.5 (fine, respirable particles) levels go up in Delhi during winter, the city is now experiencing high ozone levels every summer making the population vulnerable in both seasons./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Raipur to hold national conference on alternate uses of fly ash,"RAIPUR: In an effort to find ways to reduce pollution caused by fly ash, generated at the thermal power stations in Chhattisgarh, by using it for constructive purposes, the Corporate Social Services India (CSRINDIA) is organising a national conference in Raipur on June 11./Leading industrialists and entrepreneurs from the country and experts in alternative uses of fly ash are likely to participate in the conference. According to Rusen Kumar, Director CSR India, the aim of organising the conference is to provide a forum for fly ash producers and prospective consumers along with policy makers and stakeholders to discuss opportunities for maximum utilisation of fly ash./The conference is also likely to focus on the thermal power plants in the state, where there is an urgent need to tackle fly ash, a major cause of air pollution. It is widely perceived that if the state fails to use and effectively manage the fly ash generated at these projects, it's only a matter of time theta the Chhattisgarh would be a ""fly ash hub""./The consequences for such a scenario could be disastrous, as the entire atmosphere would be filled with black smoke, leading to the occurrence of numerous fatal diseases & water scarcity./It is widely known that the residue generated at the thermal power stations create major environmental hazards. Experts' say that it is not only causing air pollution, but also contaminate the groundwater. However, it's effective management not only reduces environmental pollution, but also recycles and reuses the same to recover some valuable resources./According to information, about Rs 2 lakh crore is likely to be invested in Chhattisgarh in various thermal plants in the next five years to generate approximately 40,000 MW of additional power. Experts estimate that that these projects, once fully functional, could generate a total of 4 crore tonnes of ash, besides emitting 11 crore tonnes of carbon dioxide. Managing the same effectively thus becomes a huge task, say experts./Fly ash can be used to manufacture fly ash bricks, mosaic tiles and hollow blocks, besides other usages."

Increasing number of vehicles behind pollution,"JAIPUR: The number of vehicles has increased considerably in the city in the past five years, which is one of the sources of pollution. In the recently released World Health Organization (WHO) report on pollution, the situation of the city is not so encouraging in terms of pollution in the air./Though the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board is encouraging people to use bicycles to cover the distance for their work, increasing number of people are using four-wheelers./According to regional transport office (RTO), every day 500 new non-commercial vehicles in Jaipur get registered including two wheelers and four wheelers. ""It is estimated that in the past five years, 1.25 lakh new non-commercial vehicles hit the road,"" RTO (Jaipur) VP Singh said./Due to increase in number of vehicles over the years, the city roads witness frequent traffic congestions, but above all, the vehicles emitting pollutants are affecting environment badly. The recently-released WHO report shows that Jaipur has 2.5 microns of diameter (PM2.5) concentration of 68 micrograms particulate matter per meter cube. However, the WHO guideline values for particulate matter is 10 microgram per meter cube for PM2.5./""The air pollution consists of many pollutants, among other particulate matter. These particles are able to penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract and therefore constitute a risk for health by increasing mortality from respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and selected cardiovascular diseases,"" says the WHO report./New patients with respiratory problems are constantly being reported in hospitals. Recently, the city is witnessing a flow of traffic on city roads consisting high end cars too. Moreover, as far as public transport is concerned, the government-owned low floor buses could be seen plying on the road emitting black smoke causing problems for pedestrians, bikers and other roadside vendors. JK Lon hospital superintendent Dr SD Sharma, who took out a rally of schoolchildren at Statue Circle on the eve of World Environment Day said, ""Men's health is determined by his environment. He is greatest enemy of his own health. Environmental pollution is one of the reasons of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and diabetes.""/The RSPCB will encourage the people of the city to use bicycles as it will organize a bicycle rally from Ramniwas Bagh to Saras Dairy. Moreover, a run for environment will also be organized in the city from Ramniwas Bagh to zoo covering major parts of the Walled City area. It will be flagged off at 6.30 am on Thursday in which government officials, Army, NCC cadets and school children would take part."
Air we breathe is dense with pollutants,"LUCKNOW: Level of air pollution in the city is higher than it was in previous pre-monsoon assessments. Ambient air quality prior to onset of rains, according to report released by the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research on World Environment Day, does not bode well for health of Lucknowites./""Pollutant concentrations in terms of respirable particulate matter (RSPM), including heavy metal (traces) nickel, in urban atmosphere of Lucknow has been found to be two to three times higher than national standards, while on the other hand, concentration of gaseous pollutants sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen (SO2 & NOx) were well below the prescribed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) at all the locations,"" said the study report./Talking to TOI, Dr Shyamal Chandra Barman head of environment monitoring division of IITR said, ""continuous rise of population and growing urban activities, along with lack of suitable measures for air pollution control, are primary reasons for increase in air pollution.""/He said ""densely populated areas leave hardly any space in the city for air to circulate. Air pollution is caused by construction activities which contribute fine particles to the air. Diesel operated automobiles and metals used in making batteries like lead and nickel don't get dispersed in the air, raising the level of pollution.""/""Contrarily, gaseous pollutants like SO2 and NOx have not increased because of technological upgrading and scientific knowhow to control them. Most vehicles are now fitted with scrubbers and eco-friendly devices,"" he added./The assessment of ambient air quality in the city was carried out in Aliganj, Vikasnagar, Indiranagar, Gomtinagar, Charbagh, Alambagh, Aminabad, Chowk and Amausi, during April-May 2014 with respect to RSPM, SO2 and NOx."" All locations recorded air pollution levels higher than prescribed national standards./Ssenior cardiovascular surgeon at SGPGI Dr Nirmal Gupta said ""Presence of lead and nickel will severely affect pregnant women, children and patients of asthma and cardiovascular problems and may even lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Chances of lung cancer rise with increase in air pollution."""
"With more vehicles in Kolhapur, air pollution levels rise","KOLHAPUR: The increasing use of vehicles has led to consistent rise in air pollution levels, affecting the environment and health of the city. For the last six months, the suspended particulate matter (SPM) and the respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) levels have been much higher than the acceptable standards./According to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the concentration of SPM in air should not exceed 150 micro gram per cubic metre and that of RSPM should not exceed 80 micro gram per cubic metre./However, data from the pollution monitoring units installed at Dabholkar Corner and Mahadwar Road showed that since the last six months, the SPM level has reached 415 micro gram per cubic metre and the RSPM level has reached 132 micro gram per cubic metre./The increasing concentration of the particulate matter in the air has significant impact on environment and local biodiversity./City-based environmentalist Uday Gaikwad said, ""The process of food formation among the plants stops when the concentration of carbon monoxide in the air increases. Also, it affects the process of pollination. Migration of birds has also been affected by rising air pollution. The city is witnessing continuous rise in temperature due to increase in carbon dioxide concentration caused by excess burning of fuel.""/A major source of high RSPM levels is vehicles and an estimated 26,000 new vehicles are added to the city every year. Experts recommend lesser use of private vehicles, especially for short distance travel./Anand Kamat, city-based physician and president of Kolhapur Medical Association, said, ""Carbon monoxide released from vehicles causes depletion in oxygen concentration of the air and thereby causes difficulties in breathing. The people with bronchial arthritis and heart ailments are much susceptible to the smoke released from these vehicles especially at the signal stops.""/He added, ""Using public transport reduces the amount of fuel consumed by the private vehicles. Also, it increases human efficiency by resorting to walking for short distance travel.""/Environmentalists and health experts said that the city needs a good public transport to encourage its use, there have hardly been any initiatives by the local authorities to promote the system./Sanjay Bhosale, additional manager of Kolhapur Municipal Transport, said, ""The public transport system in the city is being revamped and soon new buses will be added to the fleet. This will ensure comfortable and safer to travel. Also, we are going to change the bus routes so that people can use the service easily and frequently.""/Along with increasing the potential of the public transport, the civic administration has plans to make major market and tourist places as no-vehicle zone. ""We are thinking to make the road from Shivaji Putala to Bhavani Mandap near Mahalaxmi Temple as a no-vehicle zone. Also, some roads will be made one-way routes to reduce the traffic congestion at important junctions in the city,"" Bhosale added."
Eco day alert on air pollution,"GURGAON: A deadly pollutant, respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), has been found to be almost double the permissible limits in the city./According to a scientist at the Pollution Control Board, the permissible limit of RSPM is 50 micrograms per cubic metre. However, it has been recorded above 100 micrograms per cubic metre in Gurgaon. The major causes of high RSPM are increasing usage of diesel generators, rapid construction and vehicular pollution. High RSPM can lead to respiratory diseases like asthma. Continuous exposure to it can also cause lung cancer and increases the risk of cardiac attack. ""We receive at least 30 to 40 % cases of respiratory complaints in the OPD every day. Five to six patients come with chronic cough which persists for more than three weeks and does not respond to normal anti-allergens. This is definitely a matter of worry,"" said Dr Satish Koul of Columbia Asia Hospital./Dr Tapan Ghosh, cardiologist at Paras Hospital said, ""Compared to Delhi, cases of high blood pressure, respiratory and cardiac diseases are higher in Gurgaon. The main reason is that half of the city is under construction. Vehicular pollution is increasing. Besides, people don't step out as there are no good parks here. This has resulted in the limited exposure to Vitamin D which causes several diseases,"" he said./Calling for more attention to the environment, Vivek Kamboj, who runs NGO Haryali, said, ""Delhi has more parks than land for residential and commercial use. But in Gurgaon, we have more land which unfortunately is always sold to the builders."""
