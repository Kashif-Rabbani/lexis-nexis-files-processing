Crematorium smoke pollutes Kolkata,"KOLKATA: Crematoriums in the city seem to have become a major source of air pollution with the anti-pollution devices there lying almost defunct, triggering a blame-game between two key departments of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC)./In spite of spending Rs 21 lakh to install a pollution control device at the Garia crematorium, the civic body is flooded with complaints that it has stopped functioning resulting in massive pollution in and around the area. Some residents are even complaining that fly ash is entering their dining rooms./Sensing the gravity of the problem, municipal commissioner Khalil Ahmed visited some crematoriums in the city, along with senior KMC officials, recently. Ahmed has formed a committee to suggest steps to modernize the crematoriums./While KMC's electricity department officials are blaming the health department for not acting against the 'doms' - the caretakers of the crematoriums - 'responsible' for the malfunctioning of the devices, the latter has taken pot shots at the electricity section on maintenance ground./""We were expecting a respite from the thick black smoke, that billows out of the furnaces, when the KMC had installed the anti pollution device here six years ago. Within a couple of years, it developed snags and we started suffering again,"" said Pradip Roy, a Garia resident working in a government hospital at Barasat./""We don't even know how effective these devices are, since they have not undergone a rigorous test by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board,"" said a KMC health department official. Gautam Pattanaik, the director general, lighting department, however, said the state PCB had cleared the newly-installed anti pollution device at Garia subject to certain checks and modifications./Mousumi Pahari, a teacher and a resident of nearby Ramkrishnanagar, alleged that more than the black smoke and dust particles, the smell from the furnaces makes it difficult for her to live in the locality. ""The smell from the furnace Nasty smell which comes out of the furnace makes it difficult for us to stay in the locality,"" Pahari said./Similarly, those living adjacent to crematoriums like Keoratala, Birjunala in Garden Reach, Kashi Mitra, Nimtala and Siriti have been experiencing the same problem. They have registered complaints with the respective KMC borough offices seeking their immediate intervention./The municipal commissioner has asked an executive of the KMC electrical department and a sub-register of the crematoriums in the city to visit these polluting burning ghats and submit a report twice a month./Officials of the KMC electricity department blamed the civic body's health department for the mess./A report submitted to the municipal commissioner by Pattanaik alleged that the 'doms' were to be blamed for the defunct pollution devices. ""They let bodies enter the furnaces with clothes on, in lieu of money from the families of the deceased. They also put pressure on the KMC electric department staffers at the crematoriums to stop the furnace even before the bodies are completely burnt,"" the report said./Rubbishing the allegations, KMC's member, mayor-in-council (health) Atin Ghosh held the officials of the electricity department responsible. ""The furnaces are maintained by the electricity department. If the engineers fail to do their duty, what will we do?"" he asked./Crematoria in the city have become a major source of air pollution. Pollution control devices installed in a majority of Kolkata crematoria are malfunctioning, polluting localities adjoining them./Consider, for instance, the Garia Adi Mahasashan. This crematorium located in Boral is used by people in South 24 Parganas. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) headquarters has been flooded with complaints from local residents alleging major air pollution. Though the KMC health department had spent Rs 21 lakh to install a pollution control device there, it isn't working. The result is obvious. Some residents complained that fly ash from the crematoria are entering their dining rooms too./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
500MT of polluting carbon ash seized in Baleswar,"SURAT: A two-member vigilance team of Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) along with members of environment committee of Baleswar village in Palsana taluka of Surat district seized nearly 500 metric tonnes of carbon dust used as illegal fuel./The carbon dust was causing huge air pollution from industrial units located at Gujarat Eco Textile park and New Palsana industrial estate./GPCB will soon issue closure notices to these units/Following the initial non-action by GPCB, villagers of Baleswar who suffered health hazards due to air pollution took the matter in their own hands and formed a committee to take these industrial units head on. They called teams from GPCB and took them to these units in presence of local police officials and caught some of these units using this illegal fuel./Anil Patel, officer in-charge of Surat GPCB said, ""Many of these units were found using carbon powder or ash as fuel in their boilers, thus emitting large amount of black smoke. We have booked them under air pollution norm violation acts.""/Hemant Patel, a member of the environment committee said, ""We can't tolerate this pollution anymore. We will see to that all these industrial unit owners comply with the norms and stop polluting the air and water in the area.""/GPCB officials CC Patel and SK Vasava, along with villagers seized 25 MT of carbon ash from Radhekrishna Dyeing and Printing mill of Gujarat Eco Textile park, 100 MT from Khatushyam Dyeing and Printing mill, 21 MT from May Enterprise of Salim Fashion, 30 MT from Ravat-Kedia Dyeing mill, 50 MT from RatnaPriya Dyeing and 200 MT from Saumya Dyeing and Printing mills on Sunday evening./A huge amount of ash was stored in 19 rooms located near Palsana cross roads on national highway 8. The rooms were owned by one Damodar Poddar who is said to be a trader of carbon ash for these industrial units./""This carbon ash is by-product of illegal oil extractions from rubber tyres. We had taken action against 46 such units in the district some time ago. We feel Poddar is trading them to these units at Rs three per kg. It could also be coming to the area from places in Maharashtra,"" said a GPCB official./Pramod Chaudhary, president of South Gujarat Textile Processors Association, said, ""We will be calling a meeting and form a committee consisting of representatives of all the industrial areas and villagers to sort out all environmental issues in future.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Discharge of effluents polluting Meghalaya',"SHILLONG: The Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board has revealed that about 80 per cent of the pollution in Meghalaya is caused by ""indiscriminate discharge"" or disposal of domestic sewage, trade effluents, urban solid wastes, bio-medical wastes and burning of domestic fuel and vehicular exhaust emissions./Since industrial development in the state has been slow, pollution from industrial sources has not been ""that significant"", the latest report of the board said, adding in recent years, the growth of industries has increased to a certain extent from small-scale stone crushing units to large-scale cement plants, leading to ecological imbalance./The report cited rapid population growth and fast urbanization as other reasons for increase in pollution. ""Exhaust emissions from vehicles are the major contributors to air pollution since road transport is the only mode of transport in the state,"" the report tabled in the state assembly read./""Mining activities are mostly in private hands and as such coal and limestone are being exploited in an unscientific and unplanned manner without any measures for reclamation of mined areas,"" the report noted. ""Such mining activities have been causing severe water pollution and environmental degradation in the mining areas,"" it pointed out./The board has identified 1,181 polluting industrial units and establishments in the state, most of which are small units. However, the report said 11 of these are cement plants under large-scale industrial sector, which also fall under the 17 categories of ""highly polluting"" industries./The report brought to light that most of the lime calcinations units in the state are coal-fired and kilns are of ""traditional type"", which do not have hoods and chimneys venting out smoke. ""So far, no cost effective pollution control system could be suggested for such units due to the peculiar nature of the kiln structures, type of coal used and climatic condition at places where these are located,"" it said. The report said the board was regulating discharge of effluents and air emissions from industries through issuance of 'consents to establish/operate' under Water and Air Acts/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
A cracker of a celebration,"PANAJI: From the whizzing of chakras to the mighty explosion of dada bombs, firecrackers in all forms add pomp to all festivals./With the start of Ganesh Chaturthi, these explosive devices are being sold a dime a dozen./Firework stall-owners in the Panaji market were swamped with requests on the festival eve. Sanjay Mehta, a former government employee said, ""What celebration is complete without firecrackers? But we are learning slowly about their harmful effects, so we will try to limit the quantity of crackers.""/Traditionally, firecrackers are of seven types; flowerpots or fountains, sparklers, chakras, cylinders, rockets, crackers and bombs. People can also be seen splurging as much as 3,000 on different firecrackers. Flowerpots, chakras and rockets seemed to be the hottest items among buyers. A single jumbo-sized box of any type of cylinders or rockets can cost as much as 1,300, while a box of regular crackers are priced between 350 and 400./Prices have risen over the last few days. Shop owner Shanu Pankar explained, ""Prices have risen this year by 10 to 15 percent, mostly due to rise in diesel and labour prices. There has also been a decline in demand. Not because of the environment but because of the price.""/Following growing awareness about noise and air pollution caused due to firecrackers, Chinese firecrackers were banned some time ago due to smoke issues. Shops which still stocked them could only sell them, as one stall owner put it, 'under the table'. Indian firecrackers cannot be sold by anyone in India without obtaining a special licence and firecrackers which have passed inspection under the Explosives Act are assigned a class. Any material considered to be above class seven cannot be sold./There were still some who were firmly against the use of crackers. Timothy Gracias, a law student in Panaji said, ""People buy firecrackers due to unawareness. It's normal for them to burst crackers. Even if every person burst just one cracker, the overall result would be uncontrollable. To get people to stop would mean having to educate the general masses.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Shifting wind conditions, sheer volume of garbage, water shortage and power outages add to the woes of fire fighters","COIMBATORE: Efforts are on to tame the raging flames at the Municipal Corporation's 24 acre sanitary landfill facility in Vellalore which became a burning inferno on Saturday evening./A team of fire-fighters, corporation officials and employees has been working hard to put out the flames but is facing some difficulties due to shifting wind conditions and the sheer volume of garbage dumped in the landfill without proper segregation and mandatory precautionary measures. A team of officials from the district pollution control board office also visited the site and installed four air sampling devices in neighbouring residential areas to detect the level of air pollution./""With 40 men on the ground and six fire tenders, we are still in the process of putting out the fire. It will take a minimum of two to three days for the fire to be brought under control. There is some improvement in the situation although the smoke is still very thick,"" said N Subramanian, Divisional Fire Officer, Coimbatore./The major issue the fire fighters are facing is the shortage of water and the delay by corporation authorities in arranging for water tankers to refill the fire tenders deployed. The fire department has been asking for 10 water tankers at the dump yard but only six tankers are available. More than 5 lakh litres of water has already been sprayed on the burning heap of garbage. The 12,600 litre capacity overhead water tank and an open well have been the primary sources of water. On Sunday, a public utility well in Konavaikkalpalayam was also made available to the fire fighters./Power outages are also adding to the delay in getting the situation under control, as energy is essential to pump water. A single water tanker with a capacity of 9000 litres takes about 45 minutes to get completely full. The tankers are also drawing water from Puliyakulam overhead water tank./""Dump yard fires can only be controlled using a combination of water and red soil. We are dumping construction debris on the garbage heaps to reduce the smoke,"" said Dinesh Patel, General Manager, Projects, UPL Environmental Engineers Ltd, the firm that has been entrusted with the Rs 96.5 crore municipal solid waste management project./Earth removers and bulldozers are also being deployed to create pathways so that the firemen and vehicles can approach the burning waster to spray water from close proximity. Minor showers occurred in the evening at Vellalore but it subsided within a few minutes and was of no major help claimed fire rescue personnel./Senior corporation officials visited the spot and took stock of the situation. Heavy police presence has been deployed in Konavaikkalpalayam and neighbouring areas since Saturday, after residents came out on the streets demanding the immediate shifting of the dump yard to an alternate site away from residential areas./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Report raises alarm over Jaipur’s air quality,"JAIPUR: With nearly 400 vehicles being added to the city’s burgeoning fleet of private cars and commercial vehicles, the level of air population has sharply gone up along with a corresponding rise in the number of people suffering from respiratory problems./In an alarming report prepared by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), the air pollution in Jaipur has reached a critical level. The report also highlighted the deteriorating air quality of Jaipur, and stated that the pollution level is 2.8 times higher than the normal. A citizen’s survey conducted by CSE found out that nearly 88% residents of Jaipur believe that the city’s air pollution levels have increased. Nearly 94% said the cases of respiratory diseases are on the rise./The data was part of the CSE survey report which was released on Tuesday at a meet to address the city’s rising air pollution level and transportation challenges. The session was conducted in association with the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA)./“It has been found that PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 micron in size) levels have been consistently rising in the city – these are now about 2.8 times higher than the standard,” pointed out the survey report./Maximum pollution is generated by motor vehicles as per the air quality classification of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). “The city already has about 1.8 million vehicles and adds nearly 400 vehicles a day to its existing fleet,” it noted./The rise in number of private vehicles has also affected the traffic speed with the average speed plummeting to 21kmph or even slower at certain stretches./The city also witnesses an annual 10% increase in the number of vehicles, with cars outnumbering two-wheelers. Despite being a tier-2 city, the number of vehicles per 1,000 people in Jaipur is way above Delhi. While the National Capital has 332 cars per 1,000 persons, Jaipur has 551 cars./Talking to TOI, Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director- research and advocacy at CSE said, “In Delhi, the rate at which the traffic is increasing, a space of 310 footfall fields is required every year to accommodate it. The state government in Jaipur should make a policy to discourage buying private vehicles as required space is not available in the city.”/The report also highlighted that road availability in city is on the decline. Between 2007 and 20111, the road capacity has increased by 33% against a 58% increase in vehicle ownership. Such unequal development of infrastructure has led to massive congestion problems. The session stressed on less use of private vehicles and encouraged Jaipurites to reduce their carbon footprint. “Despite growing dependence on cars, the walking and cycling share – 27% and 13% respectively—is the highest compared to all other modes of transport in the city,” the report stated./A closely-built city, most trips in Jaipur are made on an average distance of less than 4km. This provides scope for residents to explore walking, cycling or using public transport to reach their destinations./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Students connect to science with their models,"MANGALORE: A smart security robot made by students of Delhi Public School (DPS) was in the spotlight at ""ENGIConnect,"" a science exhibition and competition for school students organized by the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK), Surathkal on Sunday./This robot grabbed the attention of engineering students at NITK as the robot had an adjustable camera, FM transmitter, wind speed detector and also an adjustable arm, which works through a remote./""This robot was created by referring the internet and it can diffuse bombs and can be helpful for the Army,"" Glenitta, a student of DPS, said./ENGIConnect was organized as part of Engineer-12, a five-day tech fest of NITK, which will kick start from October 24.Over 300 students from 50 schools from different parts of undivided Dakshina Kannada district participated in ENGIConnect. During this event, students presented various working and non-working science models on sustainable energy, solar energy, water conservation and other models./Another innovative model of DPS students - 'electrostatic smoke precipitator' also caught the attention of visitors. According to students, this model is a solution to prevent air pollution caused by industries. The smoke precipitator filters harmful particles from smoke particles and lets out clean air./Students of Ramakrishna School explained different methods of producing energy using windmill, hydro electric project, solar power plant, biogas and nuclear plant models. During the programme, school students were exposed to the latest trends in technology like RC Aircraft, android application development and web designing at a workshop. ENGIConnect convenor Parushya said the objective is to generate interest about science among students and to make them to think about science and technology which are not covered in academic syllabus./The winners/Students of Little Rock Indian School, Brahmawar, and Canara High School, Ramakrishna School, Prestige International School in Mangalore and NITK English Medium School, Srinivasnagar emerged winners of the science competition./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Sesa Goa Limited given nod for coke plant operation,"PANAJI: The Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) on Saturday granted permission to Sesa Goa Limited to begin operating its coke oven plant on a trial basis for three months at Navelim in Bicholim taluka./The plant was ordered to be shut August-end this year following complaints of air pollution caused by soot emerging from it./Speaking to STOI, member secretary of the GSPCB Levinson Martins said, ""Permission has been given for a trial operation of three months under the strict supervision of the inspectorate of factories and boilers.""/The board, after the incident, had directed the chief inspector of the inspectorate of factories and boilers to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the incident and to submit a report to the GSPCB with its findings and recommendations. Martins said the inspectorate submitted the report with a recommendation, and after Sesa Goa complied with the recommendation, it was allowed to operate./""There are technical recommendations and Sesa Goa has been asked to adhere to them,"" said Martins./On August 28, Sesa Goa was directed to stop all activities at its coke oven plant by the GSPCB. The directions had been issued under Section 31(A) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Section 33(A) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974./This was a few days after black dust powder entered people's houses triggering protests from the locals in the following week.

"Keep walking to keep obesity at bay, study says","NEW DELHI: More and more Indians are using cars to travel distances which are short enough to walk. A survey of 13 countries have found that 13% Indian men and 15% women use vehicles for trips that could be covered by foot./In countries like the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Saudi Arabia, this figure, however, rises to around one-in-five. Globally, the number of people walking is in decline./The study says that rising car ownership in India is discouraging walking, while in China the reduction in walking has seen an increase in obesity levels among drivers./The proportion of children walking or cycling to school fell from 48% to 13% between 1969 and 2009 in the US, and from 62% to 50% between 1989 and 2004 among primary-school children in the UK./Doctors say walking just an extra 15 minutes a day can extend human life by up to three years. A recent study of 400,000 people found that every additional 15 minutes of daily exercise such as brisk walking reduced premature death rates by a further 4%./Even slow walking burns around 114 calories per mile for someone weighing 91kg. Researchers in US have found that each extra km walked per day was associated with a 4.8% reduction in an individual’s probability of becoming obese, whereas each hour spent driving was linked to a 6% increase in an individual’s probability of becoming obese./The study by Max Bupa says, “Cars are often used for very short journeys that could be walked. In the US, cars are used for 55% of trips of one-third of a mile (half a km) in length and 85% of trips that are two-thirds of a mile (1 km) in length. A car journey of one mile (1.6 km) emits around 574g of carbon dioxide – twice as much as the average emission of 287g of carbon dioxide per mile on longer journeys.”/Reducing motor vehicle use decreases air pollution levels, which can have significant benefits for health. The study says that pollution can be particularly harmful to the health of children and older adults, and a strong relationship has been shown between levels of airborne particles, sulphur dioxide and other fossil-fuel emissions, and risk of early death from heart disease and respiratory illnesses such as allergies, asthma and lung cancer. Adults usually walk between 4,000 and 18,000 steps per day. Children aged between the ages of six and 12 typically average between 10,000 and 16,000 steps per day, while adolescents only average 8,000–9,000 steps per day. Moderate-intensity walking is at least 100 steps per minute, equivalent to approximately 3,000 steps per half hour. The health benefits of physical activity begin to be seen at levels well below that of 30 minutes a day or 10,000 steps a day. A person walking at 3 mph (5kph) uses around 30% of their maximum energy consumption when they are 25, but this increases by 10% a decade, so that someone aged 75 walking at 3mph uses up 60% of their maximum energy. Lack of walking also explains the obesity epidemic gripping India./Data shows that the burden of overweight citizens increased by 20% in India between 1998 and 2005. Currently, almost one in five men and over one in six women are overweight. In some urban areas, the rates are as high as 40%, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Obesity is the root for several non-communicable diseases (NCDs). By 2030, nearly 70% of all global deaths will be from NCDs./A number of studies have shown that using pedometers – and counting steps – can help to encourage greater walking. The majority of pedometer-based projects result in an increase of 2,000–2,500 steps per day; while among older adults and individuals suffering from chronic conditions and disabilities they have shown an average increase of 775 and 2,215 steps per day, respectively./Cardiology society of India president Dr Ashok Seth says brisk walking of 5-6 km per hour is healthiest./“Physical activity is the single most important determinant of energy expenditure. Around 40 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity five days a week, including five minutes of warm up and five minutes of cool down is a must. All risk factors of diabetes, cholesterol, obesity, stress and hypertension are controlled by a single activity, exercise,” Dr Seth said./He added, “If one can just about speak a single sentence, he is walking at the right pace. If he is able to talk comfortably, he is walking slowly. And if he cannot speak a single sentence, he is walking too fast.”/Indians aren’t sweating it out enough./The Planning Commission says a quarter of men (24%) and one-third of women (34%) of women report inadequate physical activity (defined as 1-149 minutes of activity in seven days). The proportion with inadequate physical activity is 39% and 27% in urban and rural areas, respectively. High income group is by and large more physically inactive (28.6% vs. 24.7%) as compared to low-income group./The Indian Council for Medical Research says work-related sedentary pattern is high in urban (64.1%) and peri-urban areas (44.8%) as compared to rural areas (39.0%). Leisure time physical inactivity was as high as 84.3% in urban, 87.9% in peri-urban/slum and 86% in rural areas./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Climate change adding sting to mosquito bite, says WHO report","NEW DELHI: The warning is ominous — climate change and global warming will make vector-borne diseases like dengue and malaria – already causing havoc in the country more lethal./A landmark report on climate change and health, published by the World Health Organization on Monday, said that in the last 100 years, the world has warmed by approximately 0.75 degree Celsius. Over the last 25 years, the rate of global warming has accelerated, at over 0.18 degree Celsius per decade./Global health will suffer a loss of $2 billion-$4 billion per year by 2030 due to climate change./Global warming, which has occurred since the 1970s, caused over 1.4 lakh excess deaths annually by 2004./“Many of the major killers such as diarrhoeal diseases, malnutrition, malaria and dengue are highly climate-sensitive and are expected to worsen as the climate changes,” said WHO./It added, “Malaria is strongly influenced by climate. Transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes, malaria kills almost one million people every year. The Aedes mosquito vector of dengue is also highly sensitive to climate conditions. Studies suggest that climate change could expose an additional 2 billion people to dengue transmission by the 2080s.”/WHO said over the last century, the surface area on which malaria remains a risk has been reduced from half to a quarter of the earth’s landmass, but due to demographic changes the number of people exposed to malaria has increased substantially over the same period./Estimates of cases and deaths differ greatly: the number of cases stands between 200 million and 500 million, while the death estimate is around one million per year./Dengue has become the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world./It is estimated to cause over 50 million infections and around 15,000 deaths annually in around 100 countries./“Infection could range from a mild flu-like fever to the potentially fatal severe dengue, which particularly affects individuals who are exposed to one of the four different strains of the virus as a secondary infection. Heavy rainfall can cause standing water, while drought can encourage people to store more water around the home, both providing breeding sites for Aedes mosquitoes. Warm temperatures increase the development rates of both the mosquito vector and the virus, fuelling more intense transmission,” the report said./Extreme high air temperatures contribute directly to deaths from cardiovascular and respiratory disease, particularly among senior citizens./High temperatures also raise the levels of ozone and other pollutants in the air that exacerbate cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Urban air pollution causes about 1.2 million deaths every year./Pollen and other aeroallergen levels are also higher in extreme heat./These can trigger asthma, which affects around 300 million people. Ongoing temperature increases are expected to increase this burden./WHO added that globally, the number of reported weather-related natural disasters has more than tripled since the 1960s./Every year, these disasters result in over 60,000 deaths, mainly in developing countries, it says./In 2011, 332 disasters from natural hazards were recorded in 101 countries, causing more than 30,770 deaths, and affecting over 244 million people./Recorded damages amounted to more than $ 366.1 billion. “Over the past 30 years the proportion of the world’s popu­lation living in flood-prone river basins has increased by 114% and those living on cyclone-exposed coastlines by 192%. Reports of extreme weather events and disasters have more than tripled since the 1960s,” it added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Buses aren't polluting city: Police,"KOLKATA: If you always blamed the smoke-belching, ramshackle buses for your breathing trouble, you have a supporter in the pollution control board, but not the city police. The latter claims that taxis and goods vehicles are the most polluting in Kolkata, not buses./Of the 950 vehicles prosecuted by Kolkata Traffic Police for pollution in 2011, 906 were either taxis or goods vehicles while only two were buses. If the police are to be believed, not one minibus, government bus or chartered bus was found violating pollution control norms./Air pollution figures recorded by the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB), however, reveal a contradiction. The figures hint that buses are the most polluting vehicles in the city. PCB officials primarily base their vehicular pollution report on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) emissions./On September 17 and 18 this year, when most buses were off the roads due to a bus strike, PCB recorded 10.62 microgram/cubic metre of NO2 near Rabindra Bharati University and the PM reading was 27.23 microgram/cubic metre./On weekdays, with most buses plying, the NO2 reading varies between 45-65 microgram/cubic metre and the PM reading is also up to 170 microgram/cubic metre. The same increase in NO2 and PM were recorded in other parts of the city on weekdays./""The reading is sufficient to prove that buses are the most polluting vehicles in the city,"" a PCB officer said. PCB statistics also refuse to accept that taxis are the worst offenders./But during a taxi strike on July 25, when more than 22,000 cabs went off the roads, the NO2 and PM readings did not record reduced figures in either, unlike the day of the bus strike./The contradiction, however, raises questions on the efficiency of the Kolkata Police in implementing pollution norms. Sources said the loophole lies in the system. ""We have a dedicated anti-pollution wing, which conducts raids to spot the polluting vehicles,"" said Dilip Adak, deputy commissioner (traffic)./Traffic police sources, however, claim that the wing conducts raids late at night when buses go off the roads and they never face the checks. The officers of the anti-pollution cell also allege that most of their equipment is defunct./So for years, despite being the most polluting vehicles, buses remain untouched. Perhaps government buses are the most privileged. For the past three years not one government bus was found to be a pollution offender./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Pollution level up, visibility dips","NEW DELHI: The city experienced shallow fog for the third consecutive day on Wednesday as still air and high moisture levels arising from Cyclone Nilam resulted in low visibility conditions almost through the day. Between 11am and 4pm, the average visibility was 600m at Palam and 500m at Safdarjung. The environment department also officially announced winter after pollution levels showed a rise due to low temperatures./The rise in air pollution, which is most severely felt in the winter months, is a significant contributor to the increase in fog hours. Met officials say the average fog duration per day has increased by eight hours since 1989, and Delhi is especially affected as high pollution/and aerosol levels impact visibility./“The concentration of particulate matter (PM) went up at several places between 8pm and 9 this morning. This is an annual affair in Delhi during winter,” said a government official. The pollutant category called PM10, which is acceptable up to 100mg/cubic metre, touched 1,460mg/cum between 10pm on Tuesday and 3am on Wednesday at Anand Vihar. At Mandir Marg, the hourly average from 11am to 7pm ranged between 317mg/cum and 637mg/cum./Humidity levels have been around 92-96% in Delhi for the past three days due to moisture inflow from the south. Wednesday’s maximum temperature was 28.7 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal, while the minimum was 15.2 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal./“The runway visual range at IGI airport on Wednesday morning was 800-900m while general visibility was 600m. Between 6am and 8am, we declared fog at the airport since moisture levels were quite high but later downgraded it to smog and haze. There was haze even during the afternoon as the air was still. Cyclone Nilam will cross over into Tamil Nadu by Wednesday night, bringing some respite over north India by Thursday afternoon,” said RK Jenamani, director in-charge, IGI Met. A ‘western disturbance’ around November 2-4 is expected to cause strong winds and lift the fog, he added./In 2007, Jenamani published a paper titled ‘Alarming Rise in Fog and Pollution Causing a Fall in Maximum Temperature over Delhi’ that stated that pollutants like PM and aerosol act as “additional sources of cloud condensation nuclei necessary for fog formation”./“Pollution is not the only reason for fog formation but it plays some role, especially in moderate fog formation. More significantly, it is responsible for a fall in visibility under smoggy conditions. In 2011, Delhi saw fog set in around mid-November largely due to high levels of pollution,” said Jenamani./Experts say pollution levels rise during winter as cold air is heavy and does not rise much. In such a situation, especially in the absence of wind, pollutants do not get space to disperse and tend to accumulate in the atmosphere. This is the reason for the increase in smog over the last few years. “The pollution levels that we are seeing right now will rise much more as the temperature falls. Delhi’s fixation with diesel vehicles will pose a greater threat as diesel is responsible for PM and NOx emissions. The number of vehicles has only risen in the past few years, so unless the government has some remedy in line, we can expect another poor winter,” said Anumita Roychoudhury, associate director, Centre for Science and Environment./Delhi has recorded an 81% increase in the number of registered vehicles in the last decade. From 3.6 million registered vehicles in 2001, the number went up to 6.5 million in 2011. In 1996, the city had only 2.5 million registered vehicles./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Delhi enveloped in smog, back to pre-CNG levels","NEW DELHI: Delhi's air pollution has reached alarming levels. For proof, just look out of the window. The grey-white 'haze' that has been covering the city since October 28, say experts, is actually smog that is linked to the rapid rise in particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide levels./The smog got thicker on Friday and blotted out the sun through the day. It was described by one expert as a ""toxic cocktail of poisonous gases"". Not coincidentally, Friday's air pollution levels were actually worse than the air quality recorded on Diwali last year (see graphic)./In 2001, alarmed by Delhi's rapidly deteriorating air quality, the judiciary had ordered the conversion of all public transport vehicles to the cleaner CNG. It can now be officially said - based on government data on nitrogen oxide and particulate matter (see graphic) - that gains in air quality made due to the CNG switch have now been squandered away./“This is a clear case of haze and smog due to high pollution levels,” said R K Jenamani, director incharge of IGI Met./Fog screen over city: Blame it on high pollution levels/Since October 28, when smoggy conditions descended over the city, Delhi has already recorded 91 hours of below 1,000 m visibility. The weatherman said similar conditions would prevail till Sunday./""The city has been having fog in the morning because of very high level of moisture as a remnant of cyclone Nilam. There is also no wind. However, what develops later in the day cannot be fog since the temperatures by then are too high.""/Delhi's current PM10 and NO2 levels are the worst ever. On Diwali last year, PM10 touched a high of 597 mg/cu m while on Friday, it ranged between 448 mg/cu m and 1,440 mg/cu m. Similarly, NO2, the highest level of which during last Diwali was 133 mg/cu m, ranged between 47 mg/cu m and 394 mg/cu m on Friday./Says a fact sheet by the Centre for Science and Environment, ""(Delhi's) rising nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels signal a looming problem. This pollutant strongly correlates with motorization and is held responsible for a range of respiratory ailments and sudden death syndrome in infants and so on. PM10 levels are unacceptably high and continue to be substantially above the national ambient air quality standards. After initial stabilization, particulate levels have begun to rise again""./Anumita Roychowdhury, associate director at CSE says the rise in PM10 and NO2 levels can be directly attributed to the growing number of vehicles on the city roads, since Delhi has added no other source of pollution. ""The gains from switching over to CNG have been frittered away completely. Over the past few years, we have been recording steadily rising levels of pollutants like PM10, PM2.5, oxides of nitrogen and ozone. All of these, except ozone, come from vehicular emissions,"" she said./Delhi adds more than 1,000 vehicles to its roads daily. The total number of registered vehicles currently is over 65 lakh. ""Its effects are visible in our air right now, which is nothing more than a toxic cocktail of poisonous gases,"" said Roychowdhury./In a paper published in 2007, IGI Met director in-charge Jenamani argued that rising pollution levels in the city had led to a greater number of fog and smog hours over the years as pollutants like PM and aerosols act as ""additional sources of cloud condensation nuclei necessary for fog formation"". The paper said alarming rise in fog and pollution was causing a fall in maximum temperature over Delhi./Smog is the name given to a mixture of fog and particulate matter, or smoke, arising out of polluting. A rise in pollution levels during winter months is a common phenomenon. This occurs as cold air stays close to the ground, giving pollutants smaller area for dispersal. Absence of wind, as is the case these days, also aids in higher pollution levels as the pollutants remain suspended in air. However, the early onset of smog this time is also because levels of particulate matter have scaled new heights, crossing 1,000 mg/cu m at some locations against the standard 100./Met officials say that the low visibility conditions will remain till at least November 4 and even then, will dissipate quite slowly. ""A fresh western disturbance is coming around November 5-6 which will result in west/northwesterly winds over northern India. By then, the moisture left behind by the cyclone would have dissipated. Things should start clearing up by then,"" said a Met official./The last time such low visibility conditions prevailed over Delhi in November was in 2008 when a spate of three cyclones in the month led to 245 hours of below 1,000m visibility. ""Normally when cyclones come towards the earlier part of winter, they lead to smog and not fog as temperatures are still not quite low. We are not expecting dense fog for another couple of weeks at least,"" said Jenamani./Asthma cases on the rise/The elderly and children are bearing the brunt of the smoggy weather, say doctors, as cases of asthma and chronic bronchitis rise sharply. ""We are seeing many patients who are not able to walk at home due to breathing difficulty,"" said Dr Aroop Basu of Gangaram Hospital. The gloomy skies and fall in temperatures are also leading to a surge in headaches, mood swings and depression./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Punjab on fire: NASA captures stubble burning,"LUDHIANA: Stubble burning in lakhs of agricultural fields by Punjab farmers has finally caught the eye of NASA. The Aqua satellite of NASA has sent images of the state's agri farms in which entire Punjab appears to be literally on fire, from the low Earth orbit. There is a ban on stubble burning in Punjab but it goes up in smoke every year as paddy and wheat fields are ignited by farmers once the harvest season is over./The images of the burning of paddy straw were captured by the satellite on October 31. The fields appear as little red dots of fire. NASA has commented on its website - ""What is striking about the images is the large number of fires. Smoke from hundreds of fires obscures most of the Punjab region of India.""/Without commenting on the harmful effects of stubble burning on soil fertility and environment, NASA has observed that ""this area is a major source of agriculture for India, producing approximately two-thirds of the country's food"". Ban on stubble burning has not been implemented properly and there have hardly been any police case against farmers who flout the law./Reacting to NASA pictures, Mukhtar Singh Gill, a professor at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, said, ""This is a big problem as it not only kills microbes in the soil but also causes air pollution. We have been creating awareness among farmers not to burn the stubble."" Most farmers prefer to burn the stubble instead of taking it to five biomass plants due to high transportation cost./In every district of the state, deputy commissioners issue prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC banning stubble burning but the ritual largely remains confined to paper. ""Government does not want to annoy farmers and action is taken only when fire causes some major damage,"" said an official of the agriculture department./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Smog thickens, to clear from Thursday","NEW DELHI: Belying expectations, the smog intensified in the capital on Tuesday afternoon and Met officials say that it will now only start clearing from Thursday. Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has said that though Delhi is used to such winter smog, this year’s haze has been particularly severe because pollution levels in the city have gone up manifold – particulate matter (PM10) levels have increased by 47% between 2000 and 2011, while nitrogen dioxide has gone up by 57%./The smog set in on October 28 and has managed to stump everyone. Initially the Met department had said that it would last for no longer than a week but for reasons not identified, it has persisted and in fact worsened over the days./“The condition had started improving in the morning and general visibility improved to around 1,200m by 2 pm. However, there was a sudden change in the situation and dense smog settled over the city once again. With no change in climatic conditions, we are expecting the smog to remain on Wednesday too but model show that winds of speed 20-25 kmph will pick up by Thursday that will help in moving the settled pollution particles and clear the air,” said R K Jenamani, director in-charge, IGI Met./CSE, which studied the current smog condition, said that such smog is common is Delhi during winter months “but this year’s haze has been particularly severe because pollution levels in the city have gone up manifold”. It has shared data that shows levels of PM10 have gone up from 191 mg/cu m in 2000 to 281 mg/cu m in 2011. In the same period, nitrogen dioxide levels increased from 41.8 mg/cu m to 66 mg/cu m./Arguing that it is Delhi’s massive vehicular number that is leading to its worsening environmental levels, CSE says: “Data from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee in different localities shows that pollution levels go up significantly during peak traffic hours compared to off-peak hours. For instance, in RK Puram, Mandir Marg and Civil Lines, both PM2.5 and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) concentrations are high during peak hours. Pollution levels are extremely high in Anand Vihar which witnesses very heavy traffic due to a lot of inter-state movement of vehicles and in Civil Lines, PM2.5 levels are very high even during night, possibly due to the movement of goods traffic.”/Dr Milap Punia, associate professor at JNU’s Centre for the Study of Regional Development says other than Delhi’s in situ pollution, the SCIAMACHY satellite sensor on board Envisat found very high levels of NO2 which are also a result of industrial activity in NCR towns like Ghaziabad, Noida and Faridabad./Anumita Roychowdhury, associate director of CSE said that it was time for Delhi to implement its second generation reforms for air pollution. “The market share of diesel cars is close to 60%. Even the so-called ‘clean’ diesel running on fuel with 50 ppm of sulphur allows higher limits for NOx and particulate emissions compared to petrol cars. Delhi is also taking a long time to scale up its public transport system,” she said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Sheila Dikshit puts haze onus on errant neighbours,"NEW DELHI: With the capital’s skyline disappearing under the thick smog cover leaving many breathless under the weight of the pollutant-laden air, Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit made it out to be the result of mass burning of straw by farmers in neighboring Punjab, UP and Haryana. In-charge of the environment portfolio, Dikshit maintained that the smog was not because of vehicular pollution./On Tuesday, the Supreme Court had expressed concern over the rising pollution and smog in the capital and decided to deal with it. “We are concerned with the level of smog in the city. Everyday we are hearing about the rising level of pollution in the city. We will deal with the matter,” a bench headed by Chief Justice Altamas Kabir observed./The smog emerged as a major cause of concern at the Delhi cabinet meeting on Wednesday. But Dikshit put the onus on neighboring states. “The haze has not been formed because of vehicular pollution in Delhi. Experts have found out that burning of paddy straw in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana has triggered it as the smoke has found its way to the National Capital Territory,” Dikshit said./The CM said her government will soon write to the Union environment ministry to impress upon the two states not to allow their farmers to resort to mass burning of their paddy stubbles. Apprehending further drop in air quality, Dikshit, appealed to the citizens not to burst firecrackers while celebrating Diwali next week./Dikshit will also write to her Haryana and Punjab counterparts seeking immediate intervention. “We will also write to Union urban development ministry to take up the issue with the two states as they are members of the National Capital Region Planning Board,” Dikshit said./The CM reiterated that there is no increase in pollution load from sources of air emission in Delhi as compared to previous years. “Delhi has stringent air pollution norms. Further, with improvement in the power situation, the emission from the DG sets is also under control; hence there does not appear to be any immediate contributing factors from Delhi due to which air quality here has deteriorated. There are no polluting industries in the capital as these have been moved to the NCR,” Dikshit argued./Meanwhile, the environment department has decided to get a comprehensive source appointment study done by IIT Kanpur on various air pollutants and measures to improve quality of air. The cabinet directed the environment department to take up the matter with the Union ministry of environment & forest and the NCR Planning Board to commission a study to seek out the sources of pollution./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Lyucknow wakes up to hazy morning due to smog,"LUCKNOW: The Supreme Court has expressed concern over the thick smog in Delhi due to high air pollution. The situation in Lucknow is not so severe but it is witnessing smog for last few days, obstructing sunrays and leading to drop in temperatures. On Wednesday, visibility during early hours was reduced to around 500 metres. Weather office has predicted some relief from smog in next 2-3 days but concern remains as air pollution is rising due to increase in vehicles. It will increase further with Diwali round the corner./Smog is a combination of fog and smoke or air pollutants. After winter sets in, thick dense fog hovers over North India in December and January. November normally witnesses mist or a thin layer of fog early in the morning. But this year, there has been heavy moisture incursion due to Nilam cyclone which hit the southern states six days ago. The speed of wind is also very low, hence water particles carrying pollutants are hanging in the atmosphere, resulting in hazy conditions./State Met director JP Gupta said though density of the smog decreased as the day progressed, it resulted in drop in temperatures. The maximum temperature was 28 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal, while minimum was 11.7 degrees Celsius, also two degrees below normal. Currently, northwesterly coming from snowfed winds are blowing. However, the velocity is very low, which is expected to increase in next 2-3 days. It will help in dissipating of smog but at the same time will also bring `chill’./A recent study of Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR), Lucknow, shows that air pollution has increased in the city due to growing number of vehicles and diesel generators. The amount of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in Gomtinagar was recorded at 194.8 microgram per cubic metre, almost double of permissible 100 microgram per cubic metre, followed by Indiranagar -- 161.4 microgram per cubic metre, Vikasnagar -- 157.2 microgram per cubic metre and Aliganj -- 154.8 microgram per cubic metre./In commercial areas, RSPM level was the highest in Alambagh with 260.5 microgram per cubic metre followed by Chowk -- 244.7 micro gram per cubic metre, Charbagh -- 241.2 microgram per cubic metre and Aminabad 177.3 microgram per cubic metre. Rising pollution level is also responsible for increase in density and duration of fog/smog in winters in last few years. Smog causes breathing problems and is dangerous for those suffering from lung problems. The air pollution will go up next week due to bursting of crackers during Diwali./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Don't blame Punjab for haze in Delhi: Harsimrat Badal,"ATTARI: Bathinda MP and Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Badal's wife Harsimrat Badal on Thursday asked Delhi government not to defame Punjab and blame stubble-burning in the state for the smog./Talking to mediapersons at Attari border before crossing over to Pakistan to pay obeisance at Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, Harsimrat said pollution was behind the hazy sky in Delhi and not the stubble-burning. The MP said Punjab is unnecessarily being held responsible for poor quality of air in Delhi and added that smog level could be high in Delhi due to vehicular pollution./""Maybe Delhi government has not taken adequate steps to check pollution levels. Blaming Punjab is an attempt to defame the state,"" Harsimrat said, adding that stubble burning was not new in Punjab, but an annual phenomenon./""I was also surprised to know that even the visiting Canadian delegation was holding Punjab and Haryana responsible for thick layer of haze over Delhi during dinner hosted by Prime Minister in Delhi,"" said Harsimrat./On Wednesday, Delhi government had blamed Punjab and Haryana for the smog saying the stubble-burning was increasing to the air pollution and causing the haze./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Govt to act against air pollution soon,"NEW DELHI: Delhi's action plan to curb air pollution is ready and will be presented to the cabinet in the coming week. The environment department has prepared a list of actions that will be taken immediately to avoid another case of smog, like the one that had the city enveloped for over a week recently./""The large scale smog and haze that set in over the capital on October 28 has had the government worried, even though they seem to be pointing fingers at other states for its pollution levels. The Clean Air Agenda will look at various aspects of air pollution and measures to control them under 10 major points,"" said sources./In its list of immediate actions, the government will come down strongly on open burning of leaves and garbage. It has also been suggested that discoms install temporary pre-paid electricity meters for power supply to baraat ghars and marriage halls in a bid to discourage use of diesel generator sets, especially in light of the marriage season. Battery-operated LED lights may also end up replacing the traditional ones and chandeliers used for such processions./According to Sanji Kumar, Delhi environment secretary, action will also be taken against visibly polluting vehicles moving within the city and also against those entering the city from other states. Around 121 entry points will be monitored by the corporations, traffic police and transport department./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'No Haryana role in Delhi smog',"GURGAON: The Delhi-Haryana rivalry is never more clearly on show than when the issue being addressed has anything to do with pollution. Not long ago, water pollution in the Yamuna river was the bone of contention, with the two states blaming each other for having caused it. And now, after the Delhi chief minister, Shiela Dikshit, held the neighbouring states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh - and their farm fires - responsible for the capital's daily thickening smog cover, the blame-game has begun anew./Officials of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) have said that Delhi is blaming other states for a mess that is its own creation. ""They can't blame other states for it. Delhi's pollution levels are high because municipal solid waste is burned openly there. Besides, air pollution caused by the huge number of cars and other vehicles in the capital is on the rise. That's why, this season, the smog cover is so thick there,"" said Balraj Ahlawat, district pollution officer, HSPCB, Gurgaon./Ahlawat said that an official report - making the same points and blaming the smog blanket on, among other things, high humidity levels - has also been prepared by the pollution department. ""We have a meeting on Saturday with the Central Pollution Control Board officials in Delhi, and this report will be submitted there,"" he said. Officials from the states of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab are also expected to be present at Saturday's meeting./The 'farm fires' that the Delhi government has referred to, were indeed prevalent in Haryana's rural parts, and still are a major cause for concern. Around Diwali time, farmers here carry out mass burnings of their paddy straw, causing heavy smoke emanating harmful pollutants. Even though the practice was banned in 2003, the pollution board still finds dousing these farm fires something of a challenge./""The pollution board is running awareness campaigns in 119 blocks across the state, where farmers are told about the harmful effect burning stalks has on the environment,"" said an HSPCB spokesperson. To encourage better popular participation in this drive against farm fires, the board has also announced cash prizes for the agricultural blocks that stay off this ritual this year. ""Prizes of up to Rs 50,000 are being offered to the blocks where the mass burning of paddy straw is not taking place,"" the spokesperson added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Prevent yourself from allergic reaction during Diwali,"MUMBAI: Diwali is the time for joy, fun and revelry. On this occasion bursting crackers is considered a significant part of festive celebration. As result Pollution level on Diwali gets increase very high. Heavy metals like potassium chlorate, sulphur, arsenic sulphite, aluminium and copper are spread abundantly in the air post-Diwali. The high levels of residual particulate matter (RPM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) emanates from firecrackers cause sudden spurt in health complaints mainly skin problems./The resultant air pollution triggers a train of allergies and their hazardous impact. Therefore the first and foremost precaution is to be preparing adequately for it. Allergic people should try to avoid coming in contact with firecrackers./Dr. Sachin Dhawan, Director and Consultant Dermatologist, skin n smiles, Dermatology and orthodontic centre, Gurgaon says, ""The firecrackers emit a lot of pollutants in the air and these can be troublesome for those who have an allergy condition. Severe cases of skin allergy are also noticed after Diwali."" Due to the increase in pollutant levels, symptoms like eye burns, running nose, skin allergy and skin rashes are often seen."" adds Dr. Sachin Dhawan./Dust and pollutants from the firecrackers take 3 days to settle and causes harmful effect on diseases such as allergic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, bronchial asthma, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, pneumonia and common cold./Dr. Dhawan informs, ""There are different types of allergies trigger by various chemical emit from bursting of firecrackers. The most common pollutant released from firecrackers Nitrogen Oxide trigger skin irritations, eye problems and respiratory problems in children.""/Whereas Sulphur Dioxide released from crackers, has a drastically damaging effect to the lungs it also causes wheezing & shortness of breath./The dust particles in pollution due to firecrackers are also a concern for many people those who are allergic to dust particles. People with heart, lung and problems of the central nervous system are more affected by dust./Bronchitis and Asthma patients should increase their medicine intake during this period of the year as heavy metals such as lead and cadmium in the firecrackers make breathing even more troublesome for them./Dr. Dhawan says, ""The patients with a medical condition which is prone to deteriorate in this festival should take special precaution and be prepared beforehand to deal with the situation. If you are suffering from a medical condition, it is advised that you stay away from places where the concentration of fumes from firecrackers is at its highest.""/Tips to make skin healthy while enjoying the festivities/Dr. Sachin Dhawan, Director and Consultant Dermatologist, skin n smiles, Dermatology and orthodontic centre suggest./· In festival season the skin becomes sagged, dry and dull.

Pollution audit work begins a day before Diwali,"GURGAON: The festival of lights brings with it heightened concerns over air and noise pollution levels. Around this time, Gurgaon's pollution department begins its three-day monitoring work that is carried out throughout the city, and is conducted only once a year. Special monitoring units for the programme - that begins on Monday and ends a day after Diwali on Wednesday - have been installed at five prominent points in both new and old Gurgaon. And the results, which will be announced later this week, will tell how environment-friendly was this Diwali./""We have set up monitoring stations throughout the city. We will be preparing a noise and air pollution report this Diwali after the three-day work ends,"" said Balraj Ahlawat, district pollution officer, Gurgaon, Haryana State Pollution Control Board. The MG Road mall mile, and old Gurgaon's Sadar Bazaar are among the chosen spots for the monitoring systems./Levels of suspended particulate matter, and pollutants like sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide are all gauged separately by the monitoring systems. ""We will also measure the decibel levels, which usually rise on Diwali. We are hoping that most people will stay off fire crackers this year, which add to both kinds of pollution,"" he added./The fact that this official data-collection programme is annual makes it all the more significant. Citizen groups and environmentalists campaigning against pollution here are often hard-pressed to come up with numbers and figures depicting the evident slump in air quality. And the pollution board, over all these years, has done little to streamline either the monitoring or record-keeping process. ""Pollution in Gurgaon have gone up like anything. And the evening haze, the thick smog, are all crucial indicators of how bad things have become.

It is that time when my entire family gets together first for the dhanteras puja and then the main Diwali puja. We have a family dinner on our terrace where we all get together to burst crackers and eat sweetmeats under the starry sky. My favorite part of the night is sitting on the terrace with a sparker (phool jhaddi) in my hand, craning my neck to see which rocket goes the highest, or which one bursts as the brightest in the sky. Here’s wishing you all a happy and safe Diwali./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pollution level during Diwali goes up by 30%,"LUCKNOW: Smog continued to prevail in Lucknow for the 11th consecutive day on Sunday, and is likely to intensify in the next few days due to bursting of fire crackers during Diwali festivities. Already, the air pollution level of the city is more than twice the permissible limit. The air pollution is rising because of increase in the number of vehicles and diesel generators as well as increase in the dust particles due to rise in construction activities and bad conditions of roads./Experts say that during Diwali, the air pollution level is likely to increase by 30%, which will not only be dangerous for those suffering from pulmonary diseases, but also cause breathing problem to others./The smog is a combination of fog and smoke or other air pollutants. It is created when moisture level is high in the atmosphere. It does not allow the tiny particles of pollutants to dissipate, and instead tiny water droplets carrying fine particles of pollutants and dust remain suspended in the atmosphere. At present the speed of the wind is very low. As a result, the smog is virtually hanging in the atmosphere, resulting in hazy conditions. The authorities are aware of the fact that the pollution level are alarming in the city and the fire crackers will increase it further, but no action has been taken so far./A recent survey conducted by Indian Institute of Toxicology Research reveals that the average values of PM10 in residential, commercial and industrial areas in the city are above the prescribed National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 100 µg/m3. Particulate Matter (PM) is the term for solid and liquid particles in the air. The survey found that the average value of PM was 167.1µg/m3, 230.9 µg/m3 and 217.9 µg/m3 respectively in residential, commercial and industrial areas. The noise levels during day and night in the residential and commercial areas were also found to be above the prescribed limit./Regional Officer, UP Pollution Control Board, SK Mishra said that data shows that pollution level during Diwali increases at least by 30%. Experts also said that the crackers contain elements like copper, cadmium, sulphur, aluminium, barium and various others that help in releasing vibrant colours after it is ignited. Once a cracker is burnt, it releases toxic chemicals that remain suspended for long time causing serious health aliments./The heavy metals remain in the atmosphere for long and then get oxidised before entering the food chain through vegetables./City-based chest physician Dr Ashutosh Dubey said, ""Gaseous air pollutants along with other toxic gases emitted due to burning of firecrackers aggravates the chance of attack among asthma Patients. The patients with heart disease, chronic bronchitis and low immune system are also at high risk."" He added that while harmful smoke increase the chance of conjunctivitis, loud noise makes people's behaviour irritating. Besides, burn injuries are most common on the hands, eyes and face./Similarly, ears, nose and throat specialist, Dr PP Chopra said that loud noise of crackers can damage eardrums. After a loud noise, most people feel numbness in ears for few seconds. Even loud and continuous noise can make a person deaf./Dos and Don'ts:/Light firecrackers in an open area/Remove all inflammable articles before lighting firecrackers/Wear cotton clothes that fit close/Keep doors and windows closed to prevent stray firecrackers from entering/Always ensure the supervision of an adult around children playing with firecrackers/Maintain safe distance from the firecrackers while lighting them and dispose them safely to prevent burn accidents/Keep a bucket of water or sand and a blanket neat to extinguish fire/Pour water to douse fire/In case of minor burn, pour water till the sensation subsides/Do not hold firecrackers in hand while lighting them/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Dial 108 to reach anti-burn facility,"LUCKNOW: Playing with crackers carelessly may spoil your Diwali. But one doesn't need to panic in case of injuries or accidents caused by crackers, and can dial 108 from any cell phone or fixed line phone for medical aid. Officials at the Samajwadi Ambulance Service or the 108 ambulance service have informed that burn injury is one of the many emergencies they attend. ""Our call centre would be working as usual on Diwali, so anyone who needs help can call us,"" said Rajesh Waghmare, chief executive officer of GVK EMRI, the service provider for the 108 ambulance service./Call centre head of 108 services, Sarabjit informed that asthmatic attacks and sudden fainting are also considered as emergency and would be attended by them. However, they would take patient from the point of accident to the government hospital only. It may be noted that the air pollution levels increase dramatically on the night of Diwali and this tends to trigger breathing problems in patients suffering from lung diseases. Asthma attacks can be fatal at times. Besides this, emergency units in all the government hospitals and King George's Medical University (KGMU) have been put on alert in view of anticipated burn injury cases during the festival./Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Hospital at Park Road is the only government hospital in the city with a special burn unit. A team of doctors including a plastic surgeon, an orthopaedic surgeon, a general surgeon and an ophthalmologist have been deputed to attend patients in their 24X7 burn unit. Medical superintendent, Dr Ashutosh Dubey informed that 15 beds have been reserved for Diwali patients. ""The stock of medicines and the ambulances have been put on alert. People may contact the hospital emergency helpline at 2239007 in case of need,"" he stated./In KGMU's Trauma Centre, a 25-bedded temporary burn unit has been raised. ""Instructions have been issued to the doctors of different specialties to stay alert and report to the hospital if needed. The stock of medicines is also in place,"" said Prof SN Shankhwar, chief medical superintendent, KGMU. He added that patients may alert the trauma centre at 9453004209 in case of an emergency./Similar arrangements have been made for the community health centres. Orders to this effect were given by chief medical officer, Dr SNS Yadav. ""Doctors would be available at the CHCs. To ensure that the order to this effect is implemented, we have posted a non-Hindu doctor on duty. The network of primary ambulances is also in place. People may contact our control room number 2622080, in case they need our help,"" he stated./Doctors have advised that in case of burn injury, water should be poured on the infected part before rushing the patient to the hospital. In a separate order, the chief fire officer has also put his staff on high alert./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"National capital celebrates Diwali with less noise, more smoke","NEW DELHI: Diwali celebrations across the city this year were more quiet in comparison to last year but produced more air pollution due to weather conditions and use of more smoke-producing crackers./Environmentalists attribute the reduced noise pollution this year due to usage of fewer firecrackers but raised concern over rising air pollution, saying it would impact public health especially as it comes in the wake of a spell of dense smog over the city./“Air pollutant levels during 2012 Diwali were found to be higher as compared to Diwali 2011, which can be attributed to adverse meteorological conditions or bursting of less noisy but more smoke-producing crackers,” a Central Pollution Control Board official said./CPCB monitored air quality at seven locations. The level of particulate matter (PM10) showed an increase at all locations (compared with last year’s Diwali), RSPM values too were significantly higher -- ranging between 748 and 951ug/m3 as compared to 416 and 635ug/m3 last year. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations increased at all locations. Only sulphur dioxide (SO2) levels showed a decrease from last year at three locations./On noise pollution, CPCB data showed a decreasing trend from last year. While Mayur Vihar was the noisiest area last Diwali, this year it was Lajpat Nagar which recorded 81 dBA, the same as in 2011. This was followed by Kamla Nagar (80 dBA). Mayur Vihar’s noise level went down from 91 dBA in 2011 to 73 dBA./Last year, Diwali was celebrated on October 26 during which the 24-hourly average temperatures was recorded at 26.4 degrees Celsius. This year, CPCB recorded the 24-hourly average temperature at 20.2 degrees Celsius./DPCC, the agency that monitors ambient air quality in five locations — IGI airport, Civil Lines, Mandir Marg, RK Puram and Punjabi Bagh — too showed higher air pollution. It said carbon monoxide (CO) level ranged from 1.9 to 7.5 mg/m. It was the least at IGI airport and the highest at Civil Lines. Last year, the CO range was much lower at 1.2 to 2.05 mg/m2./Similarly, nitrogen oxide levels too increased –– the highest being recorded at Mandir Marg and the minimum at R K Puram. Levels this year ranged between 65 to 117 ug/m while last year it was 59.64 to 114 ug/m. SO2 this year ranged from 20 to 88 ug/m and was the highest at Civil Lines and lowest at Mandir Marg. Last year, it ranged from 34.58 to 42.9 ug/m. Particulate matter ranged from 363 to 663 ug/m and was the highest at IGI airport and the lowest at Civil Lines. Last year, it was recorded at 104.6 to 421.4 ug/m./“It’s evident that overall pollution has increased this Diwali. While noise pollution has shown a decrease due to use of less noisy crackers, silent as well as noisy crackers both contribute to air pollution which has increased,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury from Centre for Science and Environment. “This is alarming for Delhi as we have just gone through a severe smog episode.”/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
‘Risk of COPD increases during festivals like Diwali’,"VARANASI: Just a day after Diwali, the World COPD Day was observed across the globe on Wednesday (November 14) with the theme ‘It’s Not Too Late’ emphasizing the meaningful actions people can take to improve their respiratory health./“The risk of COPD or chest diseases increases during festivals like Diwali when the level of suspended particulate matter becomes high in the ambient air,” said Prof SK Agrawal of the department of chest diseases, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University (BHU)./The main risk factors for COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) include smoking, indoor air pollution (such as biomass fuel used for cooking and heating), outdoor air pollution, occupational dusts and chemicals (vapors, irritants, and fumes)./According to the WHO report, the World COPD Day is a global effort to expand understanding of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and advocate better care for patients. Organized by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), the day is marked by activities implemented by health care professionals and groups of patients throughout the world. WHO predicts that COPD will become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030./The COPD is different from asthma. It is characterized by prolonged cough with excess sputum production and breathlessness./The breathlessness caused due to asthma can be cured after proper medication, but unfortunately, same is not the case with COPD. The patient of COPD is not cured completely. However, proper education and awareness about the disease can help reduce its occurrence./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Post-Diwali blues: High levels of air pollution choke Pink City,"JAIPUR: Call it post-Diwali blues as number of people with respiratory problems queuing outside city hospitals saw a sharp rise over the last two days. The level of air pollution increased significantly during Diwali compared to previous year. At certain places, it was two times the figures recorded for 2011./According to the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) which measured the air quality at its monitoring stations, in almost every part of the city, except one place, the pollution level went up during the festival./Road number 5 on the Sikar Road was the most polluted part in the city. Against the standard RSPM (Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter) of 100 (measured in per microgram of cubic area) for 24 hours, the RSPM for Sikar Road was recorded at 434 on Diwali./RSPM are the minute particles, which increase in number due to bursting of firecrackers and other types of polluting agents like emission from industries. An increase in RSPM spells trouble for those suffering from respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic bronchitis. These tiny particles enter the respiratory tract aggravating the respiratory problems./On Tuesday and Wednesday, nearly 50 patients suffering from respiratory diseases rushed to the Sawai Man Singh (SMS) hospital’s emergency ward for immediate medical attention. They were given oxygen therapy, a SMS hospital administration official said./An RSPCB official said, “It was observed that the concentration of RSPM increased on Diwali at all our air quality monitoring stations.” Except Malviya Industrial Area (MIA), which registered an RSPM of 105, the pollution levels shot up in all other parts of the city during the festivity./In residential areas, the air pollution was much higher than the standard level. Places like Jhalana, Ajmeri Gate, Chandpole and Sikar Road recorded high levels of pollution./Ajmeri Gate emerged as one of the most polluted areas in the city, in terms of air and noise. On Diwali, RSPM level in 2011 at Ajmeri Gate was 121, which increased to 330 this time. Noise pollution too increased from 71.2 decibel to 76.5 decibel./Being a commercial zone, the noise level standard for Ajmeri Gate is 65 decibel during the day and 55 decibel at night. Chandpole fared worse where the RSPM level touched 360 compared to 206 in 2011./In Jhalana industrial area, the air pollution level increased by two times. In 2011, the RSPM level in Jhalana was 119, which rose to 286 this year./Besides RSPM, the level of suspended particulate matter (SPM) also increased considerably. SPMs are bigger in size and less harmful./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Central Coalfield Limited fails to control smoke from washery,"BERMO (BOKARO): Sawang washery, which belongs to Central Coalfield Limited (CCL), and its adjoining areas have been shrouded by thick clouds of smoke for the past four months. About 50,000 tonnes of burning coal stock is the origin of the suffocating smoke that is raising concerns of heavy air pollution and health hazards in the neighbourhood on one hand, and the company's pollution control measures on the other./CCL, which is a subsidiary of state-run Coal India Limited, unloaded the stock a year ago. About four months ago, CCL officials management came to know about the fire when they started using the inventory, which then had 1 lakh tonnes of coal. By the time, fire had reached the upper layer of the stock./""As we removed the upper layer of the coal, flames and smoke started coming out from the layer beneath. We tried to douse the flames but in vain. Fire has spread widely underneath. We have started supplying by mixing this coal with fresh stock,"" said J S Srivastava, project officer, Sawang Coal Washery./Srivastava said the stock must have caught fire from another burning coal dump in the colliery during the blasting process, which is not unusual. ""However, water is being sprinkled through tankers and other measures are being taken to control the fire,"" he added. The reporter, however, did not find any sprinkler on the site./Srivastava further said the only solution is removing the entire stock. But the company did not make any such move. Instead, CCL is planning to exhaust the inventory by supplying the burnt coal along with the fresh stock. While the company is incurring no loss owing to the fire, the delay in action is definitely aggravating environment hazards./If CCL officials are to be believed, the situation will continue to be like this for a few more months until the entire stock is removed. ""CCL has already supplied about 50,000 tonnes to its customers in the past four months. CCL is not suffering any revenue loss,"" said Shrivastava./He added that the coal comes to the washery from different collieries of CCL situated in Bermo area. The coal after reaching here are processed and then supplied to the customers. One tonne coal is being sold at a rate of Rs 5800 while they usually get coal at a cost of Rs 1600 per tonne. The coal which is under fire is termed as Washery Grade-IV coal, and was unloaded here around a year ago./The employees working there said it is suffocating working in such an environment. A guard at the washery, Lalji Paswan, said it was hot there because of the fire. ""Heavy smoke coming out from the stock has made our lives miserable./Several senior CCL officials had came to assess the condition but nothing turned positive,"" he said./Gridhari, a resident said, that the smoke is polluting the area and creating health hazards to the people here. It is badly affecting the environment and CCL is not taking any serious step to control it.a/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
23 Delhiites die every day due to respiratory ailments,"NEW DELHI: The city seems to be paying an increasingly heavy price for its deteriorating air quality. An average of 23 people die every day due to respiratory diseases in the capital, a number that has doubled in the past four years, data released by the Delhi government reveals./Doctors warn that worsening air quality, a major trigger for respiratory conditions such as chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and infections, may cause more fatalities in the coming years if appropriate measures are not taken./The latest statistical handbook, released by Delhi government on Tuesday, shows respiratory diseases to be the fastest growing killer in a city where fatalities from most other ailments were declining. The total numbers of deaths annually have also declined significantly, which is being attributed to better access to healthcare facilities and treatment./""Among respiratory diseases, chronic bronchitis causes maximum deaths. Air pollution certainly leads to aggravation of the condition and also early onset of the symptoms. At our hospital, 20-30% of emergency admissions include such patients,"" said Dr Randeep Guleria, professor and head, department of pulmonary medicine and sleep disorders at AIIMS./On the other hand, the handbook shows a decline in many other causes of death, such as injuries (including suicides), fever, dysentery, diarrhoea and cholera, among others. According to Dr Arup Basu, senior consultant and vice-chairperson of the chest medicine department at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, most deaths due to respiratory disease occur during winter. ""In cold weather, the particulate matters hang lower in the air. When a person suffering from bronchitis inhales those pollutants, it aggravates the inflammation of the airways,"" Basu said. Severe asthma is another common respiratory illness which can turn fatal if timely medication is not available. ""Many times, we advise asthma patients to shift to less polluted parts of the country or abroad, if possible,"" he added./Vehicular emissions, say experts, is a major contributor to high levels of pollution in the city. In a drastic measure to clean the capital's air, the city's public transport switched to CNG in 2002 on the orders of the SC. Ten years later, the gains of that move have been neutralized./""An increase in the number of vehicles and inappropriate disposal of municipal solid waste are some of the factors causing increased pollution in the city,"" said A K Walia, the Delhi's health minister./Times View/The data on increasing rates of respiratory diseases in Delhi only confirms what we anecdotally knew. What it does do though is to highlight for the government the urgent need for getting its act together in controlling air pollution. The huge and rapidly growing population of vehicles in the national capital is clearly one of the major reasons for this pollution. The government frequently bemoans this and talks about ways of providing disincentives for private vehicle ownership. If it really does want to encourage people to shift from private transport to public transport, its best bet would be to enhance the scale and quality of public transport services to a level where they become the preferred option. No amount of preaching can substitute for that action./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Winter sees spurt in respiratory tract infections, skin problems","PUNE: With the onset of winter and sudden drop in temperature, scores of people are falling ill with upper respiratory tract infections, asthma and skin-related problems. The number of cases have increased by 20 to 40% in hospitals./Apart from the high air pollution in city, climate change has aggravated blood pressure and heart problems. Doctors warn that people with rheumatoid arthritis and neurological problems who have muscle spasticity (stiffness) should take additional precaution./Sanjay Agarwal, head of the department of medicine at Ruby Hall Clinic, and senior consultant, medicine, Jehangir hospital, told TOI that patients with chest infections, respiratory problems and asthmatic problems are on the rise during this winter period. There is an increase in bronchitis cases too. ""Climate change triggers these cases and we are experiencing weather-related problems. One should report early with the onset of symptoms,'' he said./Chandrashekhar Phansalkar, consulting physician, Ratna Memorial Hospital, said when the body is exposed to cold weather, we produce more heat and the energy is spend overcoming this cold. Thus, immunity drops. Persons with less immunity, such as elderly people and diabetics, are more prone to diseases. The dry cold weather in Pune aggravates asthma problems./The other common problems are skin-related problems, such as infections, allergy, itching and rashes. Dry skin has less resistance when compared to healthy skin, he said./Phansalkar said that because of the high air pollution in the city, the polluted air remain stagnated at the lower level. As repiratory problems increase, people come with complaints such as cold, sore throat, cough and sneezing, among others. When the weather is cold, the blood vessels get constricted. If a patient is already suffering from blood pressure and heart diseases, the sudden exposure to cold weather can lead to complications./Phansalkar said that patients with rheumatoid arthritis should take care. Lack of movement in joint and cold weather can aggravate the problem. One should do good exercise of joints and keep themselves warm. Also, people with neurological problems, who have muscle spasticity or stiffness, should take similar additional precaution during this period./On similar lines, Mahendra Dhadke, senior consultant medicine, Aditya Birla memorial hospital, said there has been an increase in about 30-40% increase in cases during this period./There is a spurt in airborne infections. ""The drop in temperature aggravates pneumonia and acute bronchitis. One who is prone to arthritis can get infections too. So people with arthritis should keep themselves warm and consult the doctor early. Patients with pneumonia, diabetes and heart diseases should also get vaccinated,'' he said./Abhijeet P Joshi, consultant physician, Joshi Hospital, said the incidences of cold and cough, allergy and viral infections have gone up. ""In the last three weeks, there has been an increase in around 20% such cases. We usually ask the patients to keep themselves hydrated throughout the day, rest and, if needed, give anti-histamines that specifically prevent allergic reactions,'' he said./This winter season, pediatricians are also seeing an increase in cough and cold among children. Jayant Joshi, consultant pediatrician, Gupte Hospital, said, ""over the last 4-5 days, there has been a rise in cold and cough incidences among children. But it is not significant and rarely is associated with fever or infection. Also, these cases were reported after one week of Diwali because of change in eating pattern and inhalation of smoke from firecrackers. The elders should follow the change in weather and keep their children warm,'' he said./Doctors have advised citizens to take precautions such as avoiding cold food, keeping warm, exercising regularly, staying hydrated, maintaining moisture in the skin and maintaining personal hygiene./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Ludhiana chokes as rain plays truant,"LUDHIANA: With smog still hanging thick over the city, looks like residents won't be able to breathe easy for some time. Weather experts have ruled out the possibility of rain for the next four to five days and showers are the only way to wash away the pollutants from the air./According to Surinderpal, director, Meteorological Department, Chandigarh, ""There are no chances of rain at present. The forecast suggests that weather will remain clear till November 24. We can expect clouds around that date but not rain. Ludhiana continues to be hazy in the morning and at night.""/Absence of rainfall over a few months has worsened conditions. Kulwinder Kaur Gill, Assistant Agrometeorologist at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), said, ""Smog has aggravated because there has been no rainfall after the third week of September. It will settle only after a western disturbance blows it off or the rain settles it down.""/MET Department director Surinderpal said light rain is expected in October or November. While rain is not heavy at this time, it serves the purpose of washing away pollutants. Now that the crucial spell of rain has been delayed, pollutants are present./PPCB experts said while the sharp rise in pollution during Diwali has come down, levels remain too high for routine days./Scientific officer at Punjab Pollution Control Board, Ludhiana Dr S P Verma said, ""The RSPM value remains high at around 328 micro grams per metric cube (for commercial area) and 258 micrograms per metric cube for residential areas. Normally, the values are expected to be around 250 and 200 micrograms per metric cube. Nitrogen dioxide (NOX) and Sulphur dioxide values stand at around 28 to 37 micrograms per metric cube and 12 to 16.

The number of such patients has increased by two to three times than on routine days.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Need curbs on the killer fuel: Environmentalists,"NEW DELHI: Since 2000, the levels of two key pollutants have risen sharply in Delhi’s air — respirable particulate matter (PM10) has gone up by 47% and nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 57%. Both are higher than safe levels and pose a danger to public health. They’re linked to respiratory diseases and, in the case of NOx, aggravation of heart ailments. Both are emitted mainly in diesel fumes./Reason, the Supreme Court asked for the government’s view on a proposal to tax diesel cars at the rate of 25% as a possible means of curbing Delhi’s pollution. Carmakers oppose the proposal insisting diesel isn’t used just to run cars. Generator sets, pumps to irrigate fields use diesel. Industrial pollution and the construction boom play a role./Environmentalists agree there are multiple sources of diesel emissions and all need to be tackled. But, they say, private diesel cars are a major source. The rise in PM10 and NOx levels corresponds with the growth of diesel vehicles in Delhi. The share of diesel vehicles in the Capital’s car sales has risen from 4-5 % in 2000 to almost 60% today, driven by the widening petrol-diesel price gap./But as the number of private diesel vehicles has grown, so has the myth that modern diesel technology has made the fuel clean. Experts say that’s hardly true in India. “The BharatIV norms are in force in 20 cities (including Delhi). These are 12 years behind Europe’s current norms,” Anumita Roychowdhury, who tracks air pollution at the Centre for Science and Environment, says. She has a point. NOx emission values of diesel in Bharat IV remain almost three times higher than that of petrol. Diesel norms allow significant amounts of PM while these emissions are close to zero in petrol. That apart, diesel fumes contain another class of carcinogens called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)./Earlier this year, WHO reclassified diesel exhaust as a class 1 carcinogen, placing it in the same toxic bracket as tobacco smoke. A recent AIIMS study found growing incidence of lung cancer among non-smokers in Delhi. “Exposure to diesel exhaust fumes certainly appears to be one of the factors behind this rise,” Dr Randeep Guleria, professor and HoD, pulmonary medicine at AIIMS, said./A Boston-based Health Effects Institute study in 2010 showed the zone where maximum exposure to vehicular emission takes place is up to 500 metres from major roads. Says Roychowdhury, this puts more than 55% of Delhi in the highrisk zone where pollution concentration is three-four times higher./Seen in this light, the galloping sales of diesel cars is a public health hazard that must be checked with legal disincentives. The growing demand for diesel has also meant mounting losses for oil companies. ""It's immoral of the auto industry to create demand for a fuel that makes oil refineries bleed and our lungs explode,"" said CSE chief Sunita Narain, arguing that diesel was always meant to be a fuel for public utilities./Narain said a green tax on private diesel vehicles would not only be in public interest, but should've been imposed years ago. ""We would also support an annual tax on diesel cars which should be the equivalent of the cost difference between petrol and diesel, plus a little extra as disincentive,"" she added. While both petrol and diesel vehicles pollute, going with the lesser evil may prove to be less costly for India in the long run./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Modern day fuel alternatives for nations keen on becoming energy independent,"NEW DELHI: With the surge in interest in alternative fuels for vehicles, the US Energy Policy Act of 1992 has identified, in all, eight alternative fuels. Contemporary life is closely associated with the need to reduce risk and enhance dependability. Concern for a swiftly-depleting environment has also triggered a parallel interest in the emergence of alternative fuels. The aim is to notch fewer vehicle emissions that contribute to smog, air pollution and, concurrently, global warming. Procuring alternative fuels is preferred by most nations keen on becoming energy independent./The eight alternative fuels suggested are:/Propane (Liquefied Petroleum Gas)/Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is predominantly a byproduct of natural gas processing and crude oil refining. In its naturalised state, it is a colourless, non-toxic gas that comprises 90 per cent propane, 2.5 per cent butane and higher hydrocarbons and a remaining balance of ethane and propylene. To this, in order to enhance safety, an odorant is added to help detection. Propane, in comparison to petrol / gasoline, can lower carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and other toxic emissions. It has been used in the United States as a fuel for transportation since the '40s. Of late, vehicle manufacturers offer a range of light and medium-duty propane-powered vehicles with two separate fuel systems permitting them to run on either propane or gasoline. Automobiles can also be converted from gasoline to dual fuel modes and use propane to help lower carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and non-methane hydrocarbon emissions./Methanol/Methanol has a host of benefits that drivers derive from its high performance and safety benefits. Vehicles tend to employ M85, a mixture of 85 per cent methanol and 15 per cent unleaded petrol. Even used as a substitute for diesel, Methanol is available as M100./Interestingly, most vehicles opting for methanol are fuel-flexible which means they can use 100 per cent petrol instead of methanol if needed. Methanol is a toxic, colourless, tasteless liquid with a very faint odour and is stored and handled like petrol. Though it is presently being made from natural gas, it can also be made from a range of renewable sources such as wood, coal and biomass./Methanol's advantages include lower emissions, higher performance and lower risk of flammability than petrol. There is a downside to the use of methanol though. It produces a high amount of formaldehyde in emissions. However, since methanol can easily be made into hydrogen, attempts are afoot to overcome barriers in using methanol as a hydrogen fuel source. California, being the largest energy user in the world, has clearly displayed its preference in favour of methanol as the best candidate for replacement of petroleum-based fuels./Alcohol-based ethanol/Alcohol-based ethanol, made by fermenting and distilling crops such as corn, barley or wheat, can be blended with petrol in order to increase octane levels and boost the quality of emission./Electricity/Electricity is used as a transportation alternative fuel for battery-powered electric and fuel-cell vehicles. Battery-charged electric vehicles store power in batteries that are recharged by plugging the vehicle into a standard electrical source. Vehicles that are fuel-cell run on power produced through an electrochemical reaction triggered by a combination of hydrogen and oxygen. Fuel cells are known to produce electricity without combustion or pollution, thereby cutting down on environmental damage./Hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles can have significant emissions benefits over conventional vehicles. The emissions benefits depend on the model of vehicle and type of hybrid power system being used. Where electric vehicles are concerned, there are zero tailpipe emissions and where plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are concerned, they produce no tailpipe emissions but only when in all-electric mode./The vehicles have the benefit of flexible fueling: They can be charged overnight at one's home, the workplace or at public charging stations. Hybrid electric vehicles have added flexibility, because they can also refuel with petrol or diesel as and when necessary. In the future, both the types can take advantage through solar panels on a rooftop./Hydrogen/There's an alternative in Hydrogen which when mixed with natural gas, helps create fuel for vehicles using a certain kind of internal combustion engines. Fuel-cell vehicles that run on electricity produced by a petrochemical reaction also use hydrogen and oxygen combined in the fuel 'stack.'/Biodiesel/And then, there's biodiesel created out of vegetable oils or animal fats even out of those recycled after cooking. While vehicle engines can be converted to burn biodiesel in a pure form, it can also be blended with petroleum and used in unmodified engines. Besides being safe, biodegradable, the fuel helps reduce the quantum of air pollutants associated with vehicle emissions. So, there's little particulate matter, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons./The use of biodiesel ensures a reduction in smoke due to soot free and complete combustion; hydrocarbon emission and the emission of carbon monoxide. Biodiesel is safe for transport owing to its high flash point and is bio-degradable and non-toxic. Being a renewable energy source, biodiesel is a preferred option that also helps promote rural development./P-Series fuels/P-Series Fuels are, predominantly, a blend of ethanol, natural gas liquids and methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF), a co-solvent derived from biomass. They are clear, high-octane alternative fuels used in flexible fuel vehicles which can be used either by themselves or mixed with petrol by simply adding to the tank./Natural gas/And then, there's Natural Gas which is already available to countries across the world. When used in vehicles, those with specially designed engines produce far lesser emissions as compared to petrol or diesel. Natural Gas drawbacks include high maintenance costs of pipelines, element of combustibility, issues of extraction and the levels of toxicity./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Chandrapur faces threat of groundwater pollution,"CHANDRAPUR : Chandrapur, already infamous for air pollution, is now faced with the serious threat of pollution from below the grounds. The latest report of Groundwater Survey and Development Agency (GSDA) has revealed alarming rise in nitrates level in the underground water in the district./According to the GSDA report for groundwater analysis for 2011-12, almost 60% of tested samples of groundwater in district have been found positive for alarmingly high content of nitrates. The department had collected a total of 6,339 water samples from all 15 tehsils. Of these, 5,904 samples were tested for nitrate, fluoride, chloride, iron and TDS contents in its laboratory and as many as 3,510 samples were found positive for alarmingly high nitrate contents./""Natural content of nitrates in groundwater should be 10 - 20mg per litre. America and Europe have standards of 10 mg/lit for nitrate content in water, while India holds safety standards of 45 mg/ lit for nitrates. However, the latest GSDA report states that majority of tested water sample have nitrate content between 200 mg and 300 mg per litre,"" said president of NGO Green Planet Society, Suresh Chopne./He claimed that at places like Yerkheda in Warora tehsil, nitrate content is as high as 1,218 mg/lit, while at Khadsangi, nitrate content in groundwater is at alarming level of 1,092 and 1,008 mg/ lit. As many as 660 samples from Chandrapur tehsil have been tested positive for high contamination of nitrates in the report. Other tehsils with high nitrate contamination are Nagbhid, Rajura, Korpana, Warora, Bhadrawati, Bramhapuri and Gondpipri, he said./""High industrialization in Chandrapur has led to higher emission of nitrogen in the air from coal burned in furnaces. Atmospheric nitrogen reacts with water vapour and falls in the form of acid rains on the ground adding nitrates to the underground water,"" Chopne said. Other major source of nitrate contamination is high use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides rich with nitrates./Human and animal faeces flushed into rivers and nullahs without processing also adds nitrates in the groundwater, he claimed./""Intake of nitrate contaminated water leads to 'Blue Baby Syndrome' in infants aged less than six months. This ailment decreases the oxygen carrying capacity of blood vessels leading to infant death. High nitrate contents in drinking water could also lead to deformities in unborn babies and diseases like dermatitis, gastric and intestine cancer, kidney ailment and other skin diseases,"" Chopne warned./Chopne has filed a complaint in this regard with the Central Pollution Control Board, chief minister, health minister, environment minister, local MLAs, collector, ZP CEO, district health officer and regional office of MPCB. He has urged the government and administration to take immediate steps to curb the nitrate pollution in groundwater and ensure supply of clean drinking water free of pollutants to the citizens./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Chulha smoke choking Indian women, kids","NEW DELHI: High blood pressure (BP) has become the world's deadliest disease-causing risk factor./But for Indians, indoor air pollution (IAP) — emanating from chulhas burning wood, coal and animal dung as fuel — has been found to be a bigger health hazard for Indians./The first-ever estimates of the contribution of different risk factors to the global burden of disease between 1990 and 2010 has found that household air pollution from solid fuels have risen from being the second highest risk factor for Indians./Published in the British medical journal, The Lancet, on Thursday, the study, which took five years and involved nearly 500 researchers from 50 countries, including India, found that globally high BP jumped four spots since 1990 to become the worst risk factor for disease, followed by smoking including second-hand smoke, alcohol, low fruit consumption and high body fat./However for Indians, high BP is the third worst threat after IAP and smoking, including second-hand smoke./The World Health Organization (WHO) had said that IAP was claiming 500,000 lives in India every year, most of whom were women and children. According to WHO, India accounted for 80% of the 600,000 premature deaths that occur in south-east Asia annually due to exposure to IAP. Nearly 70% of rural households in India don't even have ventilation./More than three billion people rely on the burning of solid fuels to prepare their meals. Burning solid fuels emits carbon monoxide, particulates, benzene and formaldehyde which can result in pneumonia, asthma, blindness, lung cancer, tuberculosis and low birth weight./WHO estimates that pollution levels in rural Indian kitchens are 30 times higher than recommended levels and six times higher than air pollution levels found in the national Capital./Speaking to TOI from London, the study's lead author professor Majid Ezzati of the Imperial College, London, said, ""South Asia, where India makes up the largest share of population, really shows the global risk factor transition. The leading risks are both those associated with poverty, such as under-nutrition and not having clean fuels, and those that largely affect chronic disease like high blood pressure and smoking. This mix is unique among regions.""/He added, ""Aggressive actions against smoking and other forms of tobacco use, actions that reduce blood pressure, mass media campaigns to encourage lower use of salt, or improving primary care for diagnosing and treating high blood pressure besides preventing the rise in overweight and diabetes will greatly help India.""/According to Prof Ezzati, with India economically developing, ""gas and kerosene for cooking is more affordable. What India needs to look into is how to make it available in rural India. Checking for high BP has to be made mandatory across primary health centers and medication against high BP must be encouraged besides lifestyle changes. Generic drugs manufactured by Indian companies itself are very cheap.""/Dr Ezzati finds it a strange dichotomy that while majority of Indians are vegetarians, the intake of fruit is very low./Sharing the top 10 threats for Asia, mainly India, Prof Ezzati said they include high childhood underweight, diet low in fruits, high blood glucose levels, alcohol use, iron deficiency, sub-optimal breast feeding, low physical activity and occupational injuries./According to the study, in 2010, globally the two most important risk factors were high BP — estimated to be responsible for 9.4 million deaths — and tobacco smoking (accounted for 6.3 million deaths)./Alcohol use was the third most important risk factor that believed to have claimed 5 million deaths./Collectively, dietary factors and physical inactivity were responsible for 12.5 million deaths with the most prominent dietary risks found to be diets low in fruit and diets high in sodium)./Strikingly, childhood underweight, which was ranked as the most important contributor to global disease burden in 1990 and responsible for 2.3 million deaths in that year, dropped to eighth place in 2010, and was estimated to have caused 86,0000 mortalities./In 1990, the second ranked risk factor was household air pollution from solid fuel use — responsible for 4.4 million deaths in 1990 — and although this had dropped to fourth place in 2010, it was still responsible for 3.5 million mortalities./High body-mass index caused 3.4 million deaths, high fasting plasma glucose caused another 3·4 million, high total cholesterol caused 2 million fatalities and low bone mineral density caused 0.2 million mortalities./Of the individual dietary risk factors, the largest attributable burden in 2010 was associated with diets low in fruits (4.9 million deaths) followed by diets high in sodium (4 million deaths), low in nuts and seeds (2.5 million), low in whole grains (1.7 million), low in vegetables (1.8 million) and low in seafood omega-3 fatty acids (1.4 million deaths)./The burdens of disease attributable to tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke were 6.3 million deaths./Occupational risk factors accounted for 0.9 million deaths followed by sexual abuse and violence (0.2 million deaths), unimproved water and sanitation (0.3 million deaths)/With the exception of house hold air pollution, which is a significant contributor to childhood lower respiratory tract infections, the five leading risk factors in 2010 (high blood pressure, tobacco smoking including secondhand smoke, alcohol use, household air pollution, and diets low in fruits) are mainly causes of adult chronic disease, especially cardio vascular ailments and cancers./Child and maternal under-nutrition was responsible for the next largest attributable burden of the risk factor clusters (1.4 million deaths) with childhood underweight the largest individual contributor (0.9 million), followed by iron deficiency (0.1 million) and suboptimal breast feeding (0.5 million)./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Bokaro duo wins innovation meet,"BOKARO: Two innovative minds of Pentecostal School Assembly (PAS) have bagged a free trip to Oxford Brookes University, UK, for sharing their thoughts on reduction of air pollution which has become the biggest threat leading to global warming./Two class XII students, Mayank Kumar and Kishore Kumar, have brought huge honour to their school by winning the first prize in the Innovation Challenge 2012 organized by Oxford Brookes University and IIMT, Gurgaon at Radisson Hotel, New Delhi on Friday. For these two school boys residing in Bokaro, the smoke coming out of the chimneys installed in factories is a major cause for concern. When they were given the topic 'Deploying technology for the improvement of the earth', to prove their innovation at the competition, they shared their thoughts on curbing air pollution which occurs because of the smoke coming out from factory chimneys, a common scenario in Bokaro. They came out with the solution to reduce air pollution and it included purifying chimney exhausts. They displayed it at the competition./The task was not easy for the duo as they had to compete with 1,500 participants from all over India. Mayank and Kishore outshone other students in both the rounds organized to assess the potential of the participants./""The second round which had submission of their papers was tough. Of all the participants in this round, only the top 17 students were invited to present their ideas at New Delhi. The partnership between Mayank and Kishore, who were selected among those 17 students, proved that their simple but effective ideas can make a real impact in reducing air pollution. They got huge applause from the distinguished panel of judges,"" said Daniel Michael Prasad, project guide. The young boys displayed their innovative ideas of purifying chimney exhausts so as to reduce air pollution and other related global concerns. ""We have designed an apparatus which can be connected to any industrial chimney and it will perform the task of not only reducing the temperature of the exhaust but also filtering the soot and unburnt carbon along with treating the harmful toxins like SO2, CO, NO2 and NO,"" said Kishore./Both the boys belong to middle-class backgrounds; Kishore's father runs a small business while Mayank is the son of a private tutor.

65 % of the air pollution deaths occur in Asia and close to quarter of this in India,"INDORE: According to Global Burden of Disease (GBD) count, a global initiative involving the World Health Organisation, in South Asia, air pollution is ranked as the sixth most dangerous killer. Around 65 per cent of the air pollution deaths occur in Asia and close to quarter of this in India./Reacting to the findings Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) says air pollution has become one of the top 10 killers in the world./Anumita Roychowdhury, CSE's executive director-research and advocacy and head of its air pollution unit said, ""This GBD count on air pollution and its health risks must trigger urgent, aggressive and most stringent action in India to curb air pollution to protect public health. India cannot afford to enhance health risk at a time when much of its economic growth and motorization are yet to happen.""/The latest GBD results have been produced by a rigorous scientific process involving over 450 global experts and partner institutions including the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, the World Health Organization, the University of Queensland, Australia, Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University and the Health Effects Institute./Elaborating about the findings she said death due to outdoor air pollution has increased significantly. According to the latest tally, air pollution causes 3.2 million deaths worldwide. This has increased from 800,000, last estimated by GBD in the year 2000 - a whopping 300 per cent increase. In the year 2000, GBD assessments had reported a much smaller air pollution-related burden of disease. The new estimates of particulate air pollution are based on ground-level measurements, satellite remote sensing and global chemical transport models to capture population exposure./In South Asia, air pollution has been ranked just below blood pressure, tobacco smoking, indoor air pollution, poor intake of fruits and diabetes. This is scary as outdoor air pollution is a leveler that makes everyone - rich and the poor -- vulnerable./Two-thirds of the death burden from outdoor air pollution occurs in developing Asia including India: The new GBD estimates over 2.1 million premature deaths and 52 million years of healthy life lost in 2010 due to fine particle air pollution in Asia, which is two-thirds of the burden worldwide. Killer outdoor air contributes to 1.2 million deaths in East Asia which is in throes of high level of economic growth and motorization and 712,000 deaths in South Asia (including India) which is at the take-off stage. This is much higher than the combined toll of 400,000 in EU 27, Eastern Europe, and Russia./Roychowdhury said, ""Days of doubts and complacency are over. There is hard enough evidence now to act urgently to reduce the public health risks to all, particularly the children, elderly, and poor. No one can escape toxic air. India will have to take aggressive action to reverse the trend of short term respiratory and cardiac effects as well as the long term cancer and other metabolic and cellular effects.

The new tax system is more friendly to those going for bigger cars./In real terms, the tax implication was harsher for those who buy cars costing less than Rs 5 lakh as their tax rate went up 3-fold from 2% to 6%. Two per cent additional tax is now being paid by two-wheeler buyers as they will pay now 6% instead of 4%. As a result, the cash-strapped state government has added another Rs 150 crore in its kitty by way of these taxes./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Smog poses serious hazard to Chinese cities,"BEIJING: China’s environmental authorities have come up with a shocking piece of statistic about smog. The haze choking many Chinese cities covers a total area of 1.3 million square kilometers, the Ministry of Environmental Protection said Tuesday./The area under heavy smog accounts for 13.5% of China’s total area of 9.6 million square kilometers suggesting that almost the entire industry covered areas have uncontrollable levels of air pollution that pose serious health risk to millions./The MEP said air quality across China has “notably worsened” because of the fog and haze covering several cities in recent days. The harried ministry also admitted in a report that the country’s 163 environmental assessment agencies are below standard and lack professional assessment abilities./The US Embassy, which monitors Beijing’s floating particulate matter that can percolate into lungs, said the smog on Tuesday had jumped the scales at 500 and reached 526. “I have even stopped walking the dog. Outdoor exercises do more harm than good,” Wu Min, a 40-year old health worker connected to a local hospital said./The Chinese capital presented an atmosphere filled with a grey white mass a week after the government ordered closure of several polluting industries around the capital. Thousands of people are believed to have sought medical help for respiratory problems during the recent days of heavy smog./The environment ministry, which had earlier resorted to artificial rain to reduce pollution levels, is not able to counter the combination of pollution and fog. The airport in Qingdao in Shandong province was shut down this morning due to smog, leading to the cancellation of 20 flights that left 2,000 passengers stranded. Visibility has been reduced to just 100 meters and some of the major highways have been closed, official sources said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Cancer not a death sentence: Experts,"PUNE: Cancer remains one of the most feared diseases largely because of ignorance and misconceptions, say experts./The focus of World Cancer Day this year is on dispelling damaging myths and misconceptions about cancer, which kills more people than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.

The website says that new applications are coming in every day, but no consent certificates have yet been issued. Consent fees for polluting industries here can vary from Rs 25,000 to Rs 150,000 for a year, depending on the pollution category and the investment scale of the industries. tnn/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution leads mothers to have smaller babies across the world,"MUMBAI: A worldwide study has shown that pregnant mothers exposed to air pollution emitted by vehicles and coal power plants, are significantly more likely to have smaller babies./The study, the largest of its kind ever performed, analyzed data from more than three million births in nine nations at 14 sites in the UK, Europe, North America, South America, Asia and Australia./Publishing today in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, the researchers found the higher the level of pollution, the greater the rate of low birth weight./Low birth weight is associated with serious health consequences, including increased risk of prenatal death, as well as ill health and chronic health problems in later life./Professor Tanja Pless-Mulloli, who led the UK study at Newcastle University, said: ""As air pollution increases we can see that more babies are smaller at birth which in turn puts them at risk of poor health later in life./""These microscopic particles, five times smaller than the width of a human hair, are part of the air we breathe every day. What we have shown definitively is that these levels are already having an effect on pregnant mothers.""/In the UK, Newcastle University researchers used records from the city going back over 50 years. Allowing for socio-economic status and occupation, they were able to correlate the amount of particles in the outdoor air to the birth weight of children. Low birth weight is defined as less than 2,500 grams or 5lbs 8oz./Professor Pless-Mulloli added: ""The particles which are affecting pregnant mothers mainly come from the burning of fossil fuels. In the past the culprit may have been coal fires, now it is primarily vehicle fumes./""Currently in some parts of London we see around 40 units of particulate air pollution and in Newcastle it is around 20 units but going back to the 1960’s we saw around 700 units of air pollution. While much has been done to improve air quality, this study shows we can’t be complacent as we’ve shown that clean air is really important for the health of our newborns.""/The international study was led by co-principal investigator Tracey J. Woodruff, PhD, MPH, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco along with Jennifer Parker, PhD, of the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control, USA./In the study the researchers noted that nations with tighter regulations on particulate air pollution have lower levels of these air pollutants. Particulate matter (PM) found in air pollution is measured in size (microns) and weight (micrograms per cubic meter). In the European Union, England and Wales the limit is 25 µg/m3 of particles measuring less than 2.5 microns, and regulatory agencies in Europe are currently debating whether to lower it./In the United States and Scotland, regulations require that there be no more than 12.0 µg/m3 of particles measuring less than 2.5 microns annually./The researchers observed that particulate air pollution in Beijing, China recently measured over 700 µg/m3./""We would like policy makers to use the results of this study to inform decisions on whether the permitted levels of air pollution should be changed,"" said Professor Pless-Mulloli. ""We would urge countries considering reviewing their air pollution standards to include estimates of the growth of newborns as a measure of air quality standards.""/Judith Rankin, Professor of Maternal and Perinatal Epidemiology at Newcastle University added: ""This should not deter mothers-to-be from taking exercise outdoors as the benefits of keeping active in pregnancy are well known. This is not something that individuals can address but that policy makers need to be considering.""/Reacting to the study Frank Kelly, Professor of Environmental Health at King’s College London said: ""The study by Dadvand and colleagues removes any doubt that poor air quality, in the form of particulate pollution, has detrimental effects on the unborn child. Increasing numbers of studies had suggested this to be the case but, to date, the evidence had been insufficient to infer a causal association.

Air pollution fifth leading cause of death in India: Study,"NEW DELHI: Air pollution is the fifth leading cause of death in India after high blood pressure, indoor air pollution, tobacco smoking and poor nutrition, with about 620,000 premature deaths occurring from air pollution-related diseases. Like China, India faces an unprecedented public health crisis due to air pollution, the Centre for Science and Environment’s (CSE) analysis of government data and the Global Burden of Disease report’s data on India has shown./The green think tank released its own assessment and the global study’s India specific data on Wednesday warning that the number of premature deaths due to air pollution had increased six fold over the last 10 years./Air pollution is now the seventh leading cause behind the loss of about 18 million healthy years of life in India due to illness. It comes after indoor air pollution, tobacco smoking, high blood pressure, childhood underweight, low nutritional status, and alcohol use./CSE’s own assessment of the air pollution data generated by the government painted the grim facts that are leading to the public health crisis./“Close to half of cities are reeling under severe particulate pollution while newer pollutants like nitrogen oxides, ozone and- air toxics are worsening the public health challenge,” CSE estimates say. Half of the urban population breathes air laced with particulate pollution that has exceeded the safety standards. As much as one third of urban population is exposed to critical level of particulate pollution. Smaller cities are among the most polluted in the country./The data is a damning indictment of India’s supposed growing urban regions. Out of the 180 cities that are monitored for only two towns — Malapuram and Pathanamthitta — in Kerala meet the low pollution norms (pollution levels remaining at 50% below the standard) for all pollutants./About 78% cities (141 cities) exceed the standard set for particulate matter of size below 10 microns (PM10). As many as 90 cities have critical levels of PM10 and of this, 26 cities have most critical levels of PM10, exceed the standard by more than 3 times. Gwalior, West Singbhum, Ghaziabad, Raipur, and Delhi are top five critically polluted cities./The data analysis shows the situation is only getting worse with time. “The PM10 monitoring network has doubled between 2005 and 2010 – it has increased from 96 to 180 cities. During this period the cities with low level of pollution has fallen from 10 to 2 and the number of critically polluted cities have increased from 49 to 89 cities. In 2005 about 75% of cities exceeded the standard. In 2010, a total of 78% of cities are exceeding the standard,” CSE said./Warning that vehicular pollution will continue to be the most important reason for concern in coming years as cities grow and get more densely populated, CSE has advocated that the National Ambient Air Quality Standards should be made legally binding. It has criticized the new Auto Fuel Policy Committee that is to set the benchmarks for up to 2025 for fuel quality used by vehicles. It has warned that the committee is not mandated to link the fuel standards to air pollution levels and keep public health as a parameter when setting the schedule for improvement in technology./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Toxic air stunts babies' growth,"CHENNAI: Baby Vignesh raised many an eyebrow the day he was born. Weighing less than a kg and measuring 40cm, he was unusually small for an infant born after the full gestation period./""It was unusual as babies that small are usually premature ones. He survived and is completely normal,"" said a doctor at the government hospital for women and children in Egmore, where he was born last March. A normal Indian baby weighs between 2.5kg and 3kg and measures 50cm to 80cm in length./City doctors say there has been a substantial rise in the number of smaller and underweight babies born over the last five years. Lifestyle changes, hypertension, diabetes and stress-related ailments are some of the reasons, they say./""There is another emerging factor that is increasingly having an adverse effect on fetuses, resulting in intrauterine growth retardation - air pollution,"" said gynaecologist Sumana Manohar, who is a senior consultant at Apollo Hospitals./Toxins suspended in the air that the mother breathes compromises the quality of air that the baby breathes. ""Carbon monoxide, smoke emitted by vehicles and burning garbage leaves particles suspended in the air,"" she said./Chennai has seen a considerable increase in the number of underweight babies over the years. According to Chennai corporation's birth registry, in 2008, 11.7% of the 1,13,642 babies born were underweight, while in 2012, 15.6% of the 1,17,191 infants born weighed less than normal, with 3% weighing less than a kg./A recent worldwide study done by Newcastle University in UK showed that pregnant mothers exposed to air pollution emitted by vehicles and coal power plants are significantly more likely to have smaller babies. The study analysed data from more than three million births in nine nations in Europe, North America, South America, Asia and Australia./Low birth weight is usually associated with serious health consequences, including increased risk of prenatal death as well as ill health and chronic health problems in later life. ""Many factors stunt the growth of a baby in the womb. Rising levels of air pollution play a role as it restricts oxygen supply to the baby. This includes passive smoking,"" said Meena Lochani, head of the department of obstetrics and gynaecology, Madras Medical College./According to an annual study undertaken by environmental research centres at Yale and Columbia universities in 2012, of the 132 countries surveyed, India stands last in the 'Air (effects on human health)' ranking. The study found that India's high levels of fine particulate matter are one of the major factors contributing to the country's abysmal air quality. Pollution levels were found to be nearly five times above the threshold limit where they become unsafe for human beings./""More steps need to be taken to protect pregnant women from breathing toxic air. Since reducing pollution levels cannot be done immediately, we should protect these women by reducing their stress. In the UK, women work only 29 weeks into their pregnancy. In India, women work up to their 36th week. More stringent norms must be introduced to stop this,"" said Thankam Rama Varma, medical director, Madras Medical Mission./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology to exchange info with health experts,"PUNE: City-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) plans to devise mitigation strategies for respiratory and skin diseases caused by air pollutants and harmful ultraviolet radiation, with help from medical institutions in the city. The institute plans to use the data generated by its system of air quality forecasting and research (SAFAR) for the purpose./IITM will sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with medical institutions in the Pune metropolitan region for the project. It is also in the process of arriving at a base-level understanding with the Lohegaon Air Force Station to provide flight safety as well as take-off and landing advisories if there is smog./SAFAR programme director and IITM scientist Gufran Beig told TOI that SAFAR will facilitate real-time as well as one to three-day advance information on air quality, weather and radiation (ultraviolet index). ""We will facilitate the dissemination and exchange of information with health experts on diverse aspects of the impact of environmental factors on health across different disciplines. With this, SAFAR's data on air quality, UV radiation and other parameters could be inter-related with trends in hospital admissions as well as the in-door and outdoor visits there due to different diseases,"" said Beig./Beig added that a team of dedicated scientists from IITM may play the role of epidemiologists, who are experts concerned with the study of the factors determining and influencing the frequency and distribution of disease in a given population and find their interrelationship with air pollution and climate change. ""Many respiratory diseases are caused and aggravated by air pollution. Doctors are witnessing a sudden increase in the number of patients complaining of respiratory problems. They provide a cure for the illness but may not know of the underlying cause of the sudden spurt in disease cases. With data on air quality at our disposal, we can give them the air quality situation in the city, forewarn them about a prospective increase in respiratory disease cases due to the worsening pollution levels and suggest the precautions to be taken,"" said Beig. He said that upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), among other such diseases, aggravate due to change in temperature and fluctuations in air pollution levels, causing allergic disorders. Beig added that there could be many other causes of some diseases, but inter-linkages with diseases related to air pollution can be identified more accurately./Beig further said that collaboration with medical institutes will help in devising plans that will assist in preventing the spread of a disease or minimize the impact of the spread of the disease. ""Sometimes there is a sudden increase in the number of those visiting hospitals for treatment of skin diseases. We will endeavour to relate such trends with the overall UV radiation quality in the city. The data we have will be co-related to such trends, thus helping us plan mitigation strategies,"" Beig said./IITM is in the process of collaborating with institutes like B J Medical College, Sassoon General Hospital, Ruby Hall Clinic, Chest Research Foundation, among others. ""There is a need for doctors, health experts, climate experts, air pollution experts and agricultural scientists to come together on a single platform to undertake a collective study for the benefit of citizens, which is one of the prime goals of the SAFAR mission,"" said Beig./In addition, IITM will soon provide flight safety advisories to the Lohegaon airbase during smog. ""Haze can be the product of either water molecules in the air or the result of pollution due to increase in particulate matter and other pollutants. We will gauge such factors, informing the air force and airport authority in Pune, who can then decide with their expertise, whether it is safe for planes to take off. For instance, if the haze is the result of water molecules in the air, risk may not be high and with proper safety instruments, planes can safely take off. However, it becomes risky if haze is a result of severe pollution,"" said Beig. However, the role of IITM is just to extend scientific data. As far as implementation is concerned, authorities have to take decisions based on their conclusions./Beig added that the SAFAR-Pune system, which will provide the information on the current status of air quality and its predictions 24 to 72 hours in advance, will be launched by April 2013 for the benefit of citizens. Automatic and highly sensitive optical analyzers for real time monitoring of air quality and weather parameters are already in place at the 10 identified locations namely Bhosari, Nigdi, Alandi, Pashan, Shivajinagar, Bharati Vidyapeeth, Hadapsar, Manjari, Pune Airport and Girinagar. To translate the scientific data to information, 12 giant LED display boards with a 10x6-foot dimension are put up in Swargate, Mandai, Katraj, Alaka Talkies Chowk, PMC building, IITM Pashan, Shimla Office in Shivajinagar, Pune Airport, Chinchwad, Pimpri Chowk, Alandi and Camp./Information:/UV index system in city from April/From April this year, SAFAR's Ultra Violet (UV) radio-meter will gauge the UV intensity levels in Pune on a scale of 1 to 10. Levels ranging between 0-4 will denote 'no risk' to the Indian skin type and colour. Similarly, levels ranging between 4 to 6 will denote 'medium risk', while levels between 7 to 8 will denote 'high risk' to the skin in case of exposure to the radiation. Levels above 8 will mean 'critical' to the Indian skin type./""UV index system is one-of-its-kind in India, and Pune is the first city where we will introduce it. Different colours will also be used to denote the levels of radiation in the city. Citizens can accordingly take precautions to safeguard their skin from sun burns before getting out in the sun,"" said Beig. He added that though the sun may look brighter at times, people have no way of gauging the amount of UV radiation reaching them at that point in time. ""SAFAR may warn the citizens about the severity of the sunlight, but if the UV radiation level is within the permissible limit, one need not worry about sun burns. However, there are days when the brightness of the sun may look the same as any other day, but the UV index crosses the level-8 limit. It is then that they are suggested to take precautions to avoid sun burns,"" he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Mumbai's SPM levels way above norm,"MUMBAI: The study correlating cardiac deaths and air pollution by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is the largest of its kind. It found that an increase in the volume of PM2.5 particles by 10 micrometer per cubic meter of air raises the death rate among heart patients by 20%. The study looked at 1.5 lakh patients hospitalized between 2004 and 2007 and recorded 39,863 deaths./Can this correlation between pollution and death rates be extrapolated to India? Experts said the composition of ultra-fine particulate matter would differ from city to city, making it difficult to say that Mumbai's particulate matter is equally fatal for heart-attack survivors. But they concede that air pollution is generally bad for health./The World Health Organisation-endorsed data on Global Diseases Burden, released last week, said that 6.2 lakh Indians died due to air pollution every year. Cardiologist Brian Pinto from Holy Family Hospital, Bandra, said, ""If smoking increases your risk for heart diseases, then surely air pollution is a bigger threat.''/A closer look at Mumbai's health pollution stats is worrying. Throughout January, Mumbaikars were exposed to an average of 172 micrograms of suspended particulate matter per cubic metre of air. On some days, this figure touched 235 microgram/cubic meter. Doctors said that any level of over 100 micrograms is harmful for health./Dr Rakesh Kumar of NEERI-Mumbai (National Environmental Engineering Research Institute) said, ""Particulate matter has regional background. PM in Mumbai would be different from that in London. Hence we cannot blindly extrapolate the data to Indian cities, but there is no denying that air pollution is always a serious health issue.""/Ongoing studies show that the air in Mumbai contains PM as small as 1 micrometer. Initial studies done at NEERI-Mumbai have shown that PM 1.0 mainly comes from vehicular emissions. Carbon monoxide, a major component of vehicle exhaust, is also known to be dangerous, especially for patients with weakened hearts. Said Dr Amita Athawale, who heads the Parel-based KEM Hospital's chest medicine department and is conducting several studies on the effects of air pollution, ""Ultrafine particles such as PM 2.5 are always a problem. But for heart patients, one would think that high levels of carbon monoxide gas, which is colourless and odourless, would be most dangerous.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pollution making Delhi winter days colder?,"NEW DELHI: Rising air pollution is not just a serious health threat to Delhiites, it may also be playing a part in changing the city's weather. Latest met data shows that the average maximum temperature for January has come down by 2.1 degrees Celsius since 1965, which means peak winter days have become colder in the capital./The decline is sharper from the early 1990s, corresponding with the rise in intensity and duration of fog in the national capital region ./Experts say fog, smog and haze, all linked to atmospheric pollution, cause a dimming of the sun's rays reaching the surface, leading to a drop in day temperatures./IGI met office's director in-charge R K Jenamani, who had written a paper in 2007 on the link between pollution, fog and daytime temperatures in the capital, updated the temperature figures for January at TOI's request. It shows that the falling trend in January's average maximum temperature has not only continued, but has actually accelerated./Since the turn of the century, average maximum temperatures in January have been below the month's normal (20.8 degrees Celsius) in 10 of the 14 years. In keeping with this trend, the occurrence of 'cold day' conditions in January has increased in the past 20 years./Jenamani's paper, published in Current Science in August 2007, had found a strong correlation between low maximum temperatures in Delhi's winter, foggy days and high pollution levels./It said air pollution could be increasing the concentration of aerosols (fine particles) in the air which become the seeds for fog droplets and increase fog formation under the right conditions. Daytime fog, in turn, suppresses maximum temperatures by screening out sunlight./Other experts point out that haze and smog too can depress day temperatures. ""High concentration of aerosols in the air would dim surface temperature by decreasing the intensity of sunlight reaching the surface. This has been seen across the globe,"" said Krishna AchutaRao, associate professor at IIT Delhi's Centre for Atmospheric Sciences./In fact, according to IMD, the frequency of dense fog events in the capital peaked in 2003-04 and has remained more or less at that level since . Air pollution, though, has risen during this period — as is evident from yearly respirable suspended particulate matter (PM10) levels, which are higher still in winter./""Duration of dense fog (visibility below 1,000m) in the capital has not increased since 2003-04, but still remains high. Then there's smog and fog. All these could be playing a part in lowering maximum temperatures. These trends need to be studied in detail,"" an IMD official said./Clean air makes Europe less foggy/Delhi and other north Indian cities aren't alone in facing winter fog, smog and haze due to pollution. Visibility has decreased substantially over south and east Asia, South America, Australia, and Africa, resulting in what is being called 'global dimming'. Europe, however, is an exception. It has become less foggy over the past three decades, say scientists, adding that the change can be put down to reduced air pollution. One study found a 50% drop in 'low visibility' occurrences since the 1970s, which had led to Europe warming by 0.5 degress C a decade./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Prolonged exposure to the air in the city, among the top five 'most critically polluted cities' in the country, can lead to a number of respiratory diseases, most of which directly affect the lungs./Centre of Science Environment's (CSE) analysis of government data and Global Burden of Disease's report has revealed the catastrophic air pollution level in the city./In 2009, Ghaziabad was listed as the third-most polluted industrial city following a study of 88 industrial clusters by the Central Pollution Control Board. On the scale of comprehensive environmental pollution index (CEPI), Ghaziabad had recorded 87.37, which came down to 81.14 in 2011. For recording CEPI scores in excess of 80, Ghaziabad had been put in the category of 'critically polluted areas'./Lax enforcement behind heavy air pollution: Experts/The city has one the highest levels of sulphur oxide and particulate matter in the country, both of which can lead to fatal respiratory disease. ""These pollutants in the air affect the lungs. One can have an acute attack of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Copd). It can also aggravate the conditions of those suffering from asthma,"" said Dr Harnish Vohra, pulmonologist, Columbia Asia Hospital, Ghaziabad./According to WHO, Copd is an umbrella term used to describe a common disease that limits the air flow within the lungs. It gets detected late in life and is a chronic condition which can lead even to death. %""Prolonged exposure to these pollutants can be deadly. It escalates the chances of decline in lung function,"" %Vohra said./Environmentalists at CSE said the treatment of Ghaziabad as a 'second rung' city, with lax environmental norms and enforcement, has resulted in the city's catastrophic air pollution levels. ""The problem lies in the fact that in cities such as Ghaziabad, enforcement is not as strict as in bigger and more metropolitan cities,"" CSE director general Sunita Narain said./According to the environmental think tank, the public health crisis is also because of the presence of newer pollutants in the air - especially in greener areas - that had not been taken into consideration. ""Previously, air pollution levels didn't take into account pollutants such as ozone, found in greener areas,"" Narain said./This January, the National Green Tribunal had ordered the Uttar Pradesh government to shut down 24 polluting units in Ghaziabad, out of which 15 did not meet prescribed air pollution norms.

The high court had also ordered banning of such three-wheelers which did not have pollution clearance or were more than 15 years' old.""/One of the prime reasons of the drastic increase in air pollution is the sudden increase of population in the city, which was once regarded as the summer capital of erstwhile Bihar, with simultaneous increase in number of vehicles./According to available data, the number of vehicles has increased 20 times since 2000 when the state was formed. This has pushed the air pollution to a maximum level adding highly toxic gases in the atmosphere./Environmentalist Nitish Priyadrshi said, ""The vehicles are emitting carbon dioxide which leads to global warming as well as warming the city. Due to continuous deforestation, carbon dioxide is not being absorbed which has hazardous effects on the people's health.""/The ambient quality of air has become poor because of the number of vehicles in the city leading to various dreadful diseases among the residents. Vomiting, nausea, burning of eye, skin diseases along with lung related diseases is common problems which people are facing here./Dermatologists Saroj Rai said, ""A number of cases which are coming to me mostly deal with rashes, acne on forehead, hair fall, burning and sensation in skin which are air-borne diseases.""/Besides this, extreme temperature conditions are also a drawback of the air pollution effecting people largely in the form of heavy and untimely rainfall, extreme heat and cold weather conditions which have become the prime area of concern these days./Ridhima, a resident of Kokar industrial area, said, ""We have been residing in Ranchi for more than three decades now. We used to enjoy the weather conditions of the city in the past but now it is getting worse day by day.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"India in healthcare hall of shame, ranked worst peers and neighbours","NEW DELHI: Among peers and neighbours India is performing the worst when it comes to the health of its citizens. Whether it is life expectancy, mortality due to all causes, under-five mortality or mortality among men and women between 15 and 49 years, on most counts, India ranks way below China, Brazil and Sri Lanka, just below Bangladesh and Nepal and in some cases even Pakistan./This was revealed in the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 2010 Study (GBD 2010), a collaborative project led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington. The study details the causes of death and disability — across age groups and genders — for 187 countries around the world./Sri Lanka and China fight for the top spot in India’s neighbourhood on most parameters followed by Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal. India and Pakistan figure at the bottom with India often beating Pakistan in the race to the bottom, even if marginally so./“Countries like China and Brazil and even our neighbours, who are not as well off, doing well show that India should be able to do a lot better. We are in this situation probably because we only pay lip service to health service and health system development. Our public expenditure on health is among the lowest in the world,” said Lalit Dandona, research professor, Public Health Foundation of India and professor of global health at IHME./In India, the top killer in 1990, diarrhoeal diseases, was replaced by ischemic heart disease by 2010. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) held second position through the two decades. However, lower respiratory infections were displaced by stroke by 2010 as the third most common cause of mortality. Diarrhoeal diseases moved to the fourth place followed by TB which continued at fifth place./For the entire developed world, in fact, for most of the world barring the poorer countries, the biggest killers were ischemic heart disease or stroke. For the poorer countries by 2010, the biggest killers were lower respiratory diseases, malaria and HIV. In the 15-49 age group, i.e. barring children and elderly, suicide and TB were the biggest killers for South Asia while road accidents replaced suicide in the same age group by 2010 in China. In the developed world, suicide and road injury followed by ischemic heart disease seemed to be the biggest killers in this age group. In large swathes of Africa, HIV/AIDS was the biggest killer for the 15-49 age group./In India, “road injury” is the leading killer of men in the 15-49 age group while suicides are the biggest cause of death among women in this age group. Among children in the under-five age group, preterm birth complications was the leading cause of death in India in 2010 replacing diarrhoeal disease, the top killer of 1990. Preterm complications are the biggest killers in most of the developed world too along with congenital anomalies./Lower respiratory infections, malaria and diarrhoeal diseases were the biggest killers in most of the lesser developed countries. Interestingly, the biggest risk factors for Indians were dietary risks, high blood pressure, household air pollution and tobacco smoking, including passive smoking./Dandona pointed out that it was not possible to ignore the fact that shift towards poor quality high-fat food was causing immense damage. “We will suffer as a society if we do not regulate Big Food as the companies selling beverages, snacks etc are called. Tobacco might be a clear killer but this is more insidious and many of us public health experts think we need to be smarter about how these unhealthy foods are allowed into our society,” concluded Dandona./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Polluted Beijing plans against expansion,"BEIJING: Shaken by the high level of air pollution that has sent scores of people to hospitals and attracted negative publicity worldwide, China’s capital city has set about reversing its expansion plans. It would rather be small and less modernized to avoid suffering levels of smog, say city administration officials./“We will make efforts to control Beijing’s scale through economic, legal and administrative means,” Wang Anshun, Beijing mayor said./“The conflict between rapid population growth and limited resources is our city's growing pain,” Wang said at a panel discussion during the annual parliamentary session in Beijing./The city government has also rolled out plans to encourage use of electric vehicles, offering purchase subsidies and licenses without the long waiting period, and steep license charges associated with fuel driven vehicles./There are signs the government will stop giving fresh licenses for industries in areas around the capital city as they contribute nearly one-third of the air pollution in Beijing./Recent weeks have seen smog levels calculated in terms of PM2.5 – particulate matter that includes a mix of solids and liquid droplets – crossing the danger level of 500 against the tolerable level of 20. The government has managed to keep the smog levels low during the ongoing parliament session through climate control measures and because of the reduction of chill in the atmosphere./Beijing has one vehicle for four residents. Its population has reached 20.6 million and is growing by about 600,000 people annually. The capital now has 5.2 million motor vehicles and the number is expected to reach 6.5 million in five years, the mayor said./These have resulted in many “city diseases” such as traffic congestion and air pollution. “The city can not expand in an uncontrolled way,” Wang said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Model to combat air pollution developed,"MADURAI: A final-year-engineering student has come up with a new model to control pollution from industrial smoke./A Vijay Raj, studying mechanical engineering in Kalasalingam University, has also managed to obtain a patent for his model from the controller general of patents./In Vijay's model smoke and water mixes to produce carbonic acid when hydrogen in water reacts with carbon dioxide. The method not only eliminates pollution, but also gives by-products that are useful, he says. “The carbonic acid could be used to generate electricity. The residue carbon could be used in carbon-based industries,'' says Vijay./Smoke emitted from industries could be absorbed through a pipeline and directed to a tank filled with water./To ensure the smooth passage of smoke, pressure is applied to provide velocity to the smoke travelling through the pipe and to ensure that it does not accumulate inside the chimney./The smoke entering the water tank mixes with water by the help of a rotor which is half immersed in water./It continuously rotates and produces a mixture of smoke and water, giving carbonic acid. A lead acid battery based in this solution could be used for generating electric charge./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
It's official; Hydeabad's air isn't fit to breathe,"HYDERABAD: It's official. The air in Hyderabad isn't fit to breathe. Apart from swarming with dust particles and petroleum residues, the air is dangerously laced with carcinogenic agent benzene - 8.4 mg per cubic metre - suggest latest readings available with the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB)./The permissible limit of benzene is just about 5 mg per cubic metre. Shockingly, the annual average of the pollutant, which jumped eight folds in 2012, was a meagre 1.8 in 2011./To add to that is the skyrocketing count of 'particulate matter' (both PM10 and PM2.5). Records indicate that the presence of these particles, mixture of solids and liquid droplets, is close to two times higher in Hyderabad, than the standard levels. If the average PM10 count is found to be 129 (as against 60), the count of PM2.5 is a high 56 (as against 40). Interestingly, PM2.5 was a low 15 in 2011./""The primary reason for this excessive rise in air pollution in the city is the rampant use of adulterated fuel,"" explained S Jeevanand Reddy, convener of Forum for Sustainable Environment, who has been extensively studying the trend (of pollution) since 2000. Elaborating on it further, he said, ""While the shooting benzene presence can be attributed to the burning of waste (wood, coal, etc) in the open, apart from industrial emissions, the jump in count of dust particle is only due to vehicular traffic, especially lorries and other heavy vehicles, that have resorted to the use of adulterated fuel owing to escalating price of oil.""/The readings of the state PCB are seconded by the Central Pollution Control Board in its recently released annual report for 2010-11. Apart from dust particles, the report, though updated only up to 2010, shows an abnormally high rise in the levels of oxides of nitrogen (NO), pointing at the possibility of increasing lung diseases and respiratory tract infections among residents./Analysing the readings, experts at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) too sound a word of caution. Unlike in the past, observers say, the city is now faced with a 'multi-pollutant crisis' that needs to be dealt with both urgently and meticulously./""The city, particularly in the summer months, has seen ozone and benzene (both carcinogenic) levels shoot past the standard count. This trend has been noticed more post 2004, despite the new technologies and multimodal transit systems being introduced,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, CSE, who has even carried out a detailed study in Hyderabad./According to her readings, 47% of the city's air pollution occurs due to vehicular traffic that has been on a consistent rise over the past few years./But it isn't Hyderabad alone that is reeling under the layers of 'smoky air'. Certain districts within Andhra Pradesh too, are fast making its way to the 'critically polluted' list. Among them are Nalgonda, Guntur, Vijayawada and Kurnool./If the latest RSPM (respirable suspended particulate matter) count in Nalgonda is a whopping 154 micrograms per cubic metre (as against the standard 60), the figure has crossed the 100 mark in several parts of Vijayawada. In Guntur and Kurnool too, the count is found hovering around 75 to 85. ""These cities are growing, so the problem of adulterated fuel persists here too. Also, these are high-traffic zones,"" said an APPCB official./(First of a three-part series on air pollution and its effects in Hyderabad)/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Hyderabad records rise in pulmonary diseases,"HYDERABAD: Here's an alarming revelation: Urban Hyderabad has been registering a 20-25% rise in pulmonary ailments every year. While sinus, asthma and allergies continue to take away the 'top honours' (read: most rampant), city physicians observe that acute lung infections like bronchitis too, are fast becoming commonplace among the younger lot of Hyderabadis. If that's not all, doctors also confess to a steady stream of malignant patients to their clinics these days./Ask them for a reason and prompt comes the reply. ""The air pollution levels in the city are rising abnormally. Anybody stepping out of their home is exposed to the toxic air and subsequently develop these health complications,"" said Dr D Raghottam Reddy, chest physician of Yashoda Hospital, echoing the concern of most local medical practitioners. Though Dr Reddy refrained from attributing the jump in malignancy to the presence of carcinogenic elements such as ozone, benzene and toluene in the air, he did sound a word of caution about their sudden rise in count. ""Though we are not sure if these pollutants are resulting in cancer among more and more people, the trend is no less alarming,"" the physician added./The lethal effects of Hyderabad's highly polluted air are distinctly highlighted in a report compiled by the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). Titled 'Citizen's Report: Air Quality and Mobility Challenges in Hyderabad', the survey quotes scientists of having found ""a high level of oxidative stress, lung function impairment, respiratory ailments due to air pollution"", among residents, which has led to an increase in ""drug sales related to respiratory symptoms in key locations of Hyderabad""./Not surprising that the sale of these medicines, as per the CSE study, is found to be the highest in and around Punjagutta and Abids. The two zones, according to latest data available with the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB), register the highest count of RSPM (Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter), between 120 and 140 mg per cubic metre, in the city. These critically-polluted pockets also 'boast' of a significantly high sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen presence - both considered 'killer' pollutants./""Apart from releasing statistics on rising pollution levels, we also need to analyse its impact on public health at regular intervals. Unfortunately, however, it isn't part of the PCB's mandate and is, therefore, completely ignored,"" said an official of the department. In fact, the CSE report indicates that the last such study conducted by the APPCB was over a decade ago, between 1998 and 2000. That the survey even then showed a rise in 'ventilatory defects' in residents near traffic areas and ""high prevalence of heart attacks (among people) in the 30-40 age group"" is another story./But while the composition of pollutants in the city has undergone a fair transformation (there are more life-threatening toxins in the air now), one thing has remained unchanged: the plight of the traffic police. Even now, these men are faced with a higher occupational risk owing to their extensive exposure to air pollution. And the entry of carcinogenic elements has only made matters worse./""Our health check-up records of 2011 showed that about 43% of our men suffered from lung infections. Roughly 25% had developed hearing complications while 12% of the force complained of eye problems,"" rued C V Anand, additional commissioner of police (traffic). While Anand said that several measures, such as distribution of nose masks, goggles and water-glucose kits, have been initiated in the past two years, the concern is far from resolved./""There are 700 new vehicles hitting Hyderabad's streets everyday. Unless we amend our Central Motor Vehicles Act and allow traffic cops to seize 'polluting' automobiles, this health issue will keep affecting our men,"" the city traffic chief said./(Last of a three-part series on air pollution and its effect on Hyderabad)/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Bokaro Steel neglecting green guidelines',"BOKARO: Bokaro Steel (BSL) and other thermal power plants in the district are neglecting pollution control measures, Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (JSPCB) chairman Mani Shanker said after conducting a surprise inspection on Saturday./Shanker who along with senior officials and scientists of the JSPCB also visited the Chandrapura Thermal Power Plant (CTPS) of the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) found that the companies were violating pollution norms. The team members collected samples and take out photographs during the visit./The chairman said the JSPCB had received a number of complaints from the residents related to growing air and water pollution in Bokaro, which forced the board members to conduct surprise inspection here. ""We found that the complaints are genuine as there is sheer negligence on part of the companies related to implementing of pollution norms.""/While inspecting the BSL plant, the JSPCB team found that battery V and VI of coke oven were releasing harmful smoke and fire in the air. ""The BSL management is totally negligent in controlling it. The environment is filled with such a dense smoke and heat that it becomes difficult for the team members to spend sometimes there. How can the BSL employees work in such a polluted environment,"" asked Shanker. The team has taken photographs of the smoke and fire coming out at the spot./Later, the JSPCB team visited 910-bedded Bokaro General Hospital (BGH) which is run by the BSL. The team members were surprised to know that the hospital did not have incinerator for disposal of biomedical wastes. ""This (the absence of the facility) is posing a serious threat to the environment and health of the people,"" the chairman said./However, the BGH management has assured the JSPCB team to install an incinerator by August./Talking to reporters, Shanker said in July 2010 the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had asked the BSL to follow pollution norms strictly. The CPCB team had then found that emission level in battery V of the coke oven was more than double the limit. ""The CPCB in 2012 had charged the BSL Rs 50 lakh as bank guarantee and directed the company to control the pollution level.""/Shanker said they found the BSL had not worked on the earlier direction of the CPCB. ""There is still huge amount of wastes being released by the BSL in rivers and canals of the area, which is polluting the environment. The dust catchers installed inside the BSL plant to control air pollution are ineffective and outdated. We will take necessary action against the BSL,"" said Shanker./The JSPCB team found that the CTPS was polluting the Damodar by releasing liquid ash in to the water.

Vehicles the biggest polluters,"COIMBATORE: The biggest pollutant in key southern cities is transport with increasing vehicles and limited road space, says a study conducted by New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) based on data sourced from Central Pollution Control Board. In Coimbatore and Salem, vehicles contribute a substantial part of particulate and nitrogen oxide levels in the air. Carbon emission and clogged traffic are the two major culprits of reduced air quality./Industrial units, power plants and power generators also add to the pollution. However, the increasing number of vehicles plying the road which do not comply with the emission standards poses the biggest threat. Our studies assume that cities like Chennai are far behind in terms of air pollution because of the availability of higher quality fuel and vehicles with better emission standards. The same companies have different standards for metros and tier two cities,"" says Anumita Roychoudhary of CSE, who supervised the study./Nitrogen dioxide is a serious air pollutant because it contributes to the formation of photochemical smog, which can have significant impact on health. The major source of nitrogen dioxide is the burning of fossil fuels: coal, oil and gas. Most of the nitrogen dioxide in cities comes from motor vehicle exhaust (about 80%). Other sources of nitrogen dioxide are petrol and metal refining, electricity generation from coal-fired power stations, other manufacturing industries and food processing,'' points out Anumita./High levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the likelihood of respiratory diseases. Nitrogen dioxide inflames the lining of the lungs and reduces immunity to lung infections. This can cause problems such as wheezing, coughing, colds, flu and bronchitis. Increased levels of nitrogen dioxide can have significant impacts on people with asthma because it can cause more frequent and intense attacks. Children with asthma and senior citizens with heart disease are most at risk,'' she adds./Encouraging car pools, cycling or walking to work include some measures that will bring down the pollution levels, apart from strengthening the public transport system. ""The government too must play its part. Implementing national fuel quality standards, tighter vehicle emission standards, developing a National Environment Protection Measure for diesel, improving in-service performance of diesel vehicles and developing and promoting alternative fuels can be taken up by the union government,'' she says/Coimbatore and Salem are facing challenges not just from NO2 pollution but also from high particulate pollution (PM 10). To make matters worse, the PM10 levels have risen during the last three years. The contributors to PM10 are combustion of fossil fuels, forest and stubble fires, mechanical wear and tear of vehicle parts, smoke, dirt and dust from factories, farming, and roads./It's high time we implement mass rapid transport system. Only a strong public transport system can bring down number of vehicles on the road which in turn will reduce pollution levels,"" says K Kathirmathiyon of Coimbatore Consumer Cause./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Bogged by smog,"COIMBATORE: A recent study has revealed that Coimbatore, along with Salem and Tuticorin, figure high up in the list of urban conglomerates with high particulate pollution across the four southern states. While the cotton city ranked fifth in a list of 50 towns and cities across Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in terms of high particulate pollution, it ranked third in pollution caused by nitrogen dioxide. Surprisingly, Chennai and Madurai have a lower pollution ranking than Coimbatore in both lists./A close examination of data gathered from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) by New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has found that Salem is neck and neck with Coimbatore in both NO2 pollution and Particulate Matter 10 (PM 10) pollution. Meanwhile, Tuticorin shares the dubious legacy of having critical levels of PM 10 along with Hubli-Dharward in Karanatka and Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh. Half of India's urban population breathes air laced with particulate pollution that exceeds the standards. One-third of our population is exposed to critical levels of particulate pollution. What is surprising is that smaller towns like Tuticorin and Salem are amongst the most polluted,'' says Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director-research and advocacy of CSE./According to experts at CSE, growing air pollution caused by petrochemical smog is the major reason for the high rate of pollution in southern cities. The increasing number of vehicles not in compliance with emission standards also poses a threat. ""In India, there are 6,20,000 premature deaths a year due to air pollution. Air pollution triggers stroke, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and cancer. Air pollution has been ranked among the top 10 killers in the world,'' says Souparno Bannerjee of CSE./While Tuticorin records 119 microgram per cubic metre of PM 10 ambient air concentration, Vijayawada has 93 and Hubli has 92. Salem records 85 and Coimbatore maintains 76. Meanwhile, Kochi has 61 microgram per cubic metre of PM 10 ambient air concentration while Chennai has 59 and Madurai has 47. Palakkad, just 45 km away from Coimbatore, has just 32./Regarding NO2 pollution, Bangalore records 31 microgram per cubic metre while Mysore records 28. Coimbatore comes third with 27 while Salem comes closer with 26. Madurai has 25 and Kochi has 17 while Chennai has only 15./The figures reveal an urgent need for immediate action. Scaling up of public transport, integrated multi-modal transport options, car restraints and walking or cycling for clean air include some of the measures to contain pollution levels,'' said Anumita./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Doctor solves Kolkata's waste riddle,"KOLKATA: Half the terrace of his Beliaghata house is occupied by his lab where he is found obsessed with converting domestic waste into energy. The other half houses an overgrown garden fed by rich manure, a byproduct of his biogas plant. Dr Bijon Bihari Mukhoti is a general physician who these days takes little interest in medicine. ""Even as he checks his patients at Dankuni Hospital, his mind stays in the terrace,"" chuckled his wife Sanjukta./Last September, Dr Mukhoti was struck by a news that KMC was looking for a new dumping ground for the enormous municipal waste. ""Since then, I have been engaged in developing a compact biogas plant that can convert waste into gas with high caloric value. The fuel can cook faster than LPG. After several trials, I have developed the plant which holds the promise of converting the city's waste into huge amount of energy,"" he said./Most biogas plants currently in operation in India and elsewhere are designed for animal waste as their main feedstock, and are therefore used in rural areas. In cities, majority of the people use LPG or kerosene for cooking. The immediate benefit from owning a compact biogas system is savings in cooking cost./""The advantage of this biogas plant is that you only need bio-degradable domestic waste. Before putting the bio-waste in the main processing barrel, I collect the muck of a pond which is home to anaerobic bacteria. Biogas is produced by the anaerobic digestion or fermentation of biodegradable materials like green waste, plant materials and/or other domestic wastes. Biogas comprises primarily methane and Carbon Dioxide (CO{-2}) and may have small amounts of Hydrogen Sulphide, moisture and siloxanes,"" explained Dr Mukhoti, while his wife started brewing tea on a burner fed by biogas./Methane doesn't produce any smoke or soot. The introduction of this environment-friendly cooking system will also help prevent millions of premature deaths in rural households due to indoor air pollution caused by smoke and soot from burning fuel wood. The solid residue produced by the plant makes a good manure that can to a large extent relieve farmers of their over-dependence on chemical fertiliser, Mukhoti elaborated./Chemistry is close to Dr Mukhoti's heart. ""I became a doctor by default. My father was a doctor, so am I,"" he said. But his baptism in chemistry was literary by fire. As a hardcore member of the revolutionary ultra-Left group, the young Mukhoti used to make lethal socket bombs in the turbulent '70s. ""Later, I realised that violence would take us nowhere. The idea of armed revolution left me, but the love of chemistry stayed,"" said the 63-year-old, who is bit of an oddity to his colleagues./Not everybody took Mukhoti's effort in the right spirit. ""Our neighbours and relatives were very upset with the unbearable stench that the biogas plant used to emanate. Even I often thought it was madness. After his round-the-clock duty at Dankuni Hospital for three days, he would come home and straightaway head for the roof. But my ideas changed when I could first brew tea on the gas burner. It cooks faster than LPG,"" admitted Sanjukta./Dr Mukhoti has resolved the issue of stench, too. I used lime to negate the stench and magically the amount of CO{-2} also came down./What does he want to do with this plant? ""This is only a 'pilot project'. I am still working on it so that it becomes highly sustainable and commercially viable. If the state government or any major agency comes up, we can solve the city's waste-dumping issue for the benefit of the citizens. With LPG prices soaring, why wouldn't we look for a cheaper alternative?"" Mukhoti pointed out./Points to note/Biogas can also be cleaned and upgraded to natural gas standards when it becomes bio methane./Normally, biodegradable waste that is left to decompose releases two main gases that cause global climate change: nitrogen oxide and methane. Nitrogen dioxide (NO{-2}) warms the atmosphere 310 times more than carbon dioxide and methane 21 times more than carbon dioxide./By converting bio-waste into methane biogas via anaerobic digestion, West Bengal can produce enough electricity to power hundreds homes across Bengal./Furthermore, by converting bio-waste into methane biogas instead of letting it decompose, global warming gases could be reduced by ninety-nine million metric tons or four percent. In Nepal biogas is being used as a reliable source of rural energy./If concentrated and compressed, it can also be used in vehicle transportation. Compressed biogas is becoming widely used in Sweden, Switzerland, and Germany. A biogas-powered train has been in service in Sweden since 2005./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"​High air pollution in Patna, cardiac ailments’ risk up","PATNA: High air pollution in the state capital is posing a threat of not only respiratory trouble among the city residents but may also spawn cardiac problems. It is also likely to increase mortality rate among heart disease patients./According to the data given by Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), the air pollution situation in the city is really disturbing. The standard annual mean Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) of up to 60 microgram per cubic meter is not harmful, but the RSPM mean is almost triple that level now in Patna./The board’s data reveals that the annual average of RSPM recorded in the year 2006-2007 was 117. The figure touched 122 in 2007-2008 and in the year 2011-2012, RSPM rate grew to 167 microgram per cubic meter. BSPCB’s study on health hazard of air pollution also revealed that with long exposure to RSPM, a person may develop diseases like bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema and thus, consequently, Cor Pulmonale./A recent study correlating cardiac deaths and air pollution by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the largest study of its kind, found that an increase in the volume of PM2.5 particles by 10 micrometer per cubic meter of air raises the death rate among heart patients by 20%./Another recently released World Health Organization-endorsed data on Global Diseases Burden said that 6.2 lakh Indians died due to air pollution every year. According to cardiologist Brian Pinto from Holy Family Hospital, Mumbai, smoking increases the risk for heart diseases, but air pollution can prove to be a bigger threat./Patna’s noted heart surgeon Dr Ajit Pradhan endorsed this view. He said smokers develop a disease called Cor Pulmonale, and those in constant exposure to dust particles too may develop the disease. Cor Pulmonale is enlargement of the right ventricle of the heart as a response to increased resistance or high blood pressure in the lungs, said Pradhan./Where the left ventricle (chamber) of the heart pumps blood throughout the body, the right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs where it is oxygenated and returned to the left heart for distribution. In normal circumstances, the right heart pumps blood into the lungs without any resistance. However, when a person suffers from chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) caused due to accumulation of pollutants in the lungs, the small blood vessels become very stiff and rigid. As time passes, the right ventricle becomes too weak to push blood in the lungs and eventually fails, said Dr Pradhan, explaining the interdependence between pollution, lung disorder and Cor Pulmonale./A cardiologist of the Jeevak Heart Hospital, Dr Alok Kumar told TOI around 10 to 20% patients he attended suffered from COPD./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Ban? MC men love to set leaves on fire,"CHANDIGARH: There seems to be no end to the year-after-year sight of piles of leaves on fire by the roadside, sending swathes of dark smoke into the atmosphere and scarring the earth and surrounding brush. Oblivious to the ban on burning of dry leaves, the cleaning staff of Chandigarh municipal corporation, who are the main violators, carry on with this offence day after day, unmindful of being penalized./In the absence of any deterrent measures by the MC, the violators take the easy way out by disposing of the leaves by setting a match to the piling heaps./The penalty figures bring out the real story. In April 2012, the civic body got over 100 calls from city residents informing the fire and emergency department of dry leaves on fire, but the MC could nab only one offender. He was spotted on the dividing road of Sector 29/30 by a sanitary inspector and handed over to the PCR cops. The department has already received 36 calls this month, but no arrests have been made./Residents allege that it is MC's own sanitary staff which is responsible for flouting the ban in majority of the cases. Hitesh Kumar Puri, president of Sector 43-B RWA said, ""I was shocked to see MC employees burning piles of dry leaves openly some days back. When I questioned them, they claimed they had done it by mistake. They do not clear the dry leaves properly and these end up choking the sewers.'' Despite the tall claims of the civic body to stop this illegal act by making efforts to hire trolleys and manpower to cart away the dry leaves and issuing special instructions to their employees, people continue burning leaves without fear. Faced with the massive violations of the ban, MC officials say they don't have the requisite manpower or a monitoring mechanism to keep a check on public as well as their employees./Leaf burning is banned as it causes air pollution, health problems and is a fire hazard. Leaf smoke may also contain hazardous chemicals such as carbon monoxide, which can bind with haemoglobin in the bloodstream and reduce the amount of oxygen in the blood and lungs./Additional municipal commissioner Sunil Bhatia said, ""We can't cover the entire city and check everywhere, so 100% control on burning is not impossible. We have the powers to challan violators, but I can't remember if we have issued any such challan. We have asked sanitary inspectors to keep surveillance in their respective areas to nail such violators.""/The authority has 10 trolleys for lifting the littered leaves and hired 10 more from April 1, but this doesn't appear to have made a difference. The everyday landscape of heaps of dry leaves, many smouldering away, bear this out./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

If they don't follow the rules we will forfeit the Rs 25 lakh and 50 lakh of CTPS and BSL, respectively, which has to be submitted to the board as bank guarantee,"" said Shankar. BSL and CTPS have been given June 10 and June 15 deadlines, respectively./On March 23, the green board found that BSL plant's batteries V, VI and VIII of coke oven were releasing harmful smoke that was polluting the atmosphere. The surprise inspection was conducted following several complaints from residents of the industrial area here./CTPS, the pollution board further found, was releasing liquid ash into the Damodar, raising the risk of water-borne diseases. ""We found that ash mixed with water was being discharged into the Damodar by the CTPS plant,"" said Shankar./The team had collected water samples from near the plants and test results showed heavy pollution due to discharge of industrial effluent. ""We found that huge amount of waste were being released by BSL into rivers and canals of the area, which is polluting the environment./The dust catchers installed inside the Bokarp Steel Plant Limited plant to control air pollution are ineffective and outdated,"" said Shankar. Despite regular reminders by the board to follow pollution control norms strictly, the two units were found breaching the norms regularly./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Asthmatic need to be careful about pranayam',"NAGPUR: Pranayam has become a big fad and a part of preventive health care among a large section of people. However, doctors warn that some persons, especially those suffering from breathing disorders like asthma, could come to more than harm than good if they adopt wrong and faulty breathing techniques./Hence, as a part of the World Asthma Day (May 7) programme, Dr Sushant Meshram, an asthma and respiratory consultant, who runs the Asthma Allergy Respiratory Clinic in Dhantoli, is organizing a diagnostic-cum-guidance camp for asthma patients from 11am./""Asthma patients already suffer from respiratory problems. If they do breathing exercises that increase their breathing rate suddenly, it can prove extremely harmful. Breathing exercises or pranayam should be done very cautiously. It is very common for patients of asthma in our country to go for self-treatment in the form of pranayam,"" Dr Meshram told reporters here. In fact, Pranayam is not a treatment for asthma but yes it can be used as a supportive therapy./Dr Meshram said normally a person breathed 15 times in a minute or took approximately 21,600 breaths in 24 hours. Breathing in and out was a continuous process without any gap. During various pranayams, the duration of respiration is prolonged like ujjai pranayam and pauses are added between inhaling and exhaling./The respiratory rate is made faster in bhastrika, kapalbhati and person breathes with resistance in anuloma or pratiloma. As patients of asthma already have increased resistance of airway tube due to swelling, air is trapped within the balloon like structures in lungs and their breathing rate increases heavily during pranayam. Any fast breathing pranayam like bhastrika or kapalbhati or locking the breath may prove dangerous for asthma patients, the doctor said./ASTHMA FACTS/Some 4.9% children 2.38% adults are asthmatic/Women using biomass and solid fuels have a significantly higher risk of asthma than those using cleaner fuels/Allergy to pollen, house dust mites or pets also increases chance of developing asthma/Exposure to tobacco smoke, air pollution or other inhaled irritants can cause asthma/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Modern lifestyle leaves urban folk wheezing: Expert,"VARANASI: There is a sharp increase of asthma patients due to environmental pollution and lack of awareness towards the disease and its morbidity. ""There is a need to create awareness among people about asthma, a modern-day disease caused by environmental pollution,"" said Dr JK Samaria, professor and head, department of chest disease, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University (BHU) and national secretary of Indian Chest Society./""Besides, the rapidly increasing modernisation and consequent changes in lifestyle has caused rapid increase in asthma prevalence,"" said Samaria, adding that being concerned about the rapid growth of the disease, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared first Tuesday of May as World Asthma Day. This year the World Asthma Day is being observed on May 7 with the theme 'You can control your asthma'. The WHO has set a target of reducing the asthma disease by 50% in the years to follow, he said./He said asthma and allergic diseases are increasing more rapidly in developed and developing countries as compared to under developed countries. Similarly, the disease is more prevalent in urban areas in comparison to rural areas and more in affluent people in comparison to the poor. In a country like India where rapid developments are taking place and consequently the changes in lifestyle and food habits, asthma is increasing at an alarming pace./According to him, in coming days number of asthma patients will increase manifold due to environmental pollution and lack of awareness about the disease and its morbidity. Day by day pollution levels are increasing everywhere forcing the humanity to the point of suffocation. With decrease in natural forests and increase in urban concrete, the newer spectrum of photochemical pollutants due to combustion of petrol and diesel are on the rise. Today, principal pollutants posing detrimental effects on human lungs are the oxides of Nitrogen (NO2) and particulates, he said, adding that due to modern lifestyle increased consumption of packaged food and fast foods is yet another factor responsible for increase in prevalence of asthma./Samaria said newborn babies, deprived of breast feed, are more susceptible to asthma. In a recent study it was observed that if a newborn baby is adequately protected from harmful smoke exposure and fed by mother in the first four months, the risk of developing asthma reduces significantly, he said./A study conducted by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) also suggests that children are more susceptible to environmental pollutants than adults. The special vulnerability of children to air pollution exposure is related to several differences between children and the adults. Children generally spend more time and are also more active outdoors than adults. They are active outdoors during midday when air pollution levels are higher and have significantly higher oxygen demands so their respiration is higher and they inhale more air per unit of body weight than adults. Because of their smaller stature their breathing zone is lower, so they inhale air loaded with more particles. The diameters of their airways are smaller and therefore more likely to be affected by inflammation produced by air pollution. Their lungs are still developing, hence are more vulnerable to airborne infections. The efficiency of detoxification system of the body develops in time-dependent pattern. This in part accounts for increased susceptibility of children at critical points in time. Children's immune defence is immature and less active against inhaled pathogens./Varanasi witnesses violation of the prescribed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). According to CPCB report on 'Air Quality Trends and Action Plan for Control of Air Pollution from Seventeen Cities', it has been observed that NAAQS (24 hourly average) of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) are violated in Varanasi. As per standards, the concentration of particulate matters should not exceed 60 microbgram/m3 (24 hourly average) in the ambient air. But the trend showed that concentrations of RSPM and SPM were 100-150 microgram/m3 and 300-400 microgram/m3, respectively. However, Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and Oxides of Nitrogen (NO2) standards were not violated./Samaria said obesity also heightens the suffering of asthma patients manifold. With the help of inhalation therapy the disease can be controlled well and patients can lead a normal life. With inhalation therapy the patient gets the effect of the drug in 1/20{+t}{+h} of the dose compared to the normal oral drug, he said, adding that inhalation therapy does not cause any addiction and neither has any toxicity or adverse effect even with long term usage. He said people should adopt some practical measures to avoid asthma and minimise the frequency and severity of acute attack of asthma./Practical measures to avoid asthma and minimise frequency and severity of acute attack of asthma/# Avoid indoor trigger factors especially mite allergens by means of frequent washing of bed sheets, covering the pillow and mattress with covers, regular cleaning of carpets and exposing woolen clothes to sunlight before start of use every year./# Avoid keeping pets especially those with fur such as cats and dogs/# Use face mask to avoid pollution while moving outdoors/# Use fresh, leafy vegetables and avoid packaged and fast food/# Keep obesity under control through regular exercise and balanced diet/# All asthmatic patients should undergo spirometry test every year/# All asthmatic patients should take their inhalation therapy in doses advised by the doctor regularly/(Source: Dr. JK Samaria)/Sources of Air Pollution in Varanasi/# Vehicular air pollution:/The traffic pattern is characterised by intermixing of slow and fast moving vehicles, passing of inter and intra city traffic through the busy portions of city. Typical characteristics are improper road geometries, encroachments, inadequate road widths and road networks. These factors are either singularly or in combination, responsible for frequent and long lasting traffic jams in the city./# Industrial air pollution:/Varanasi, being a place of religious, historical and tourist importance, also enjoys the status of an important place in India in the production of various handicraft items like silk sarees, carpets, zari jamdani, rugs, customary knitting of jamavars.

"'AC, carpeted rooms triggering asthma attacks'","VISAKHAPATNAM: Long hours spent in air-conditioned and carpeted rooms and genetic factors are now being increasingly seen as major causes of asthma, which was earlier attributed mainly to vehicular exhaust and other forms of air pollution./At least 40% of asthma patients are those who have been exposed to indoor pollution, say doctors ahead of World Asthma Day, which falls on May 7./As much as 60% of asthmatic patients had genetic predisposition to asthma, 45% were diabetics, 25% were smokers, 20% consumed alcohol regularly, and in another 20% the asthma was associated with atopic dermatitis or skin allergy, found a joint study on 120 asthmatic patients by the Andhra University department of Human Genetics and Andhra Medical College in Visakhapatnam in 2011-12, which was published in the Journal of Allergy and Asthma Immunology./""The air conditioners and carpets at the offices and homes, soft toys, furry pets and smoking are to be blamed for increase in asthma cases in all age groups,"" said Pradyut Waghray, pulmonologist at Kunal Institute of Medical Specialties and director at Isha Hospital./""We find that around 4-5 asthma patients out of every 10 have been subjected to continuous indoor pollution and hence were getting asthma attacks. These days, most offices and homes are carpeted and air-conditioned. If carpets and AC filters are not cleaned at regular intervals, they give rise to dust mites and certain types of virus and bacteria that make vulnerable people prone to asthma attack,"" said the doctor./""Similarly, hair of furry pets like cats and dogs and fibres in soft toys act as allergens for some and cause asthma attacks. Again, if one of the parents is a smoker, the child is more likely to get asthma as the nicotine in cigarette consists of about 4,000 particles, which can cause damage to the bronchi,"" said the doctor./There's also a 10-15% increase in adult asthma cases, especially due to rise in diabetic cases as there's a link between diabetes and asthma, added Waghray./Pulmonologists also focus on the proper use of inhalers to keep asthma under control in keeping with the World Health Organisation theme 'you can control your asthma.'/""Sadly, in India, hardly 10% of the asthma-affected use inhalers mistaking that they are suffering from temporary respiratory problem or allergy and not asthma. Many use oral medication, which mix with the blood stream and may have side effects unlike the traditional inhalers nor they daily take preventive inhalers,"" averred K Subhakar, senior doctor of Government Chest Hospital and zonal taskforce chairperson for RNTCP (revised National TB control programme), South India./""Asthma patients, even if in good health, should take inhaled steroids as preventer inhalers twice daily and broncho dilators or reliever inhalers during an attack. To be more effective, inhalers should also be used through spacers (a bottle like device) for the medicines to go to the lungs properly instead of remaining in the throat.

Chennai breathless as more vehicles add to pollution,"CHENNAI: Everyone takes the air they breathe for granted, but many city doctors feel the need to focus on respiratory health is more pressing now. The rapid increase in vehicle population in the city has led to ENT and pulmonology clinics seeing a surge in cases of respiratory illnesses caused due to severe air pollution./The allergy and pulmonology clinic at the Madras ENT Research Foundation (MERF), which registered 823 cases of respiratory illnesses in 2011, saw more than 1,472 cases last year with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) topping the list./“With its humid weather acting as a trigger, Chennai seems to choke with respiratory issues and the situation will ease only when the pollution levels come down,” says MERF managing director Dr Mohan Kameswaran. He said 90% of the patients coming to the clinic suffered from dust allergy that stemmed from environmental pollution. “Earlier only adults had such problems. Now, even children are suffering. We see patients who come in with wheezing, nasal bleeding and inflammation where there is a block in the airway, all the result of inhaling soot and carbon particles emitted by vehicles,” he said./The thoracic medicine department at the Government General Hospital registered 53,000 cases of respiratory illness in 2011. The numbers rose to 65,000 last year. “Episodes of difficulty in breathing can be triggered by a variety of factors, most notably allergens, infections and environmental pollutants. A large chunk of patients with asthma and bronchitis suffer from dust allergy,” says chest disease specialist Dr Ranganathan of GH. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has set the permissible limit for respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) at 100 microgram/cubic metre. “But the levels of pollutants are twice the permissible amount in several parts of the city, and with nearly 40 lakh vehicles choking the roads every day, immediate steps have to be taken to control the situation,” said the doctor./Dr G S Vijayachandar, pulmonologist at the Institute of Thoracic Medicine in Chetpet, says 200 of the 300 patients that crowd the institute everyday suffer from block in the airway tract caused by air pollution. While pollution has been the culprit that has children and adults wheezing at every breath, doctors are also worried about smoking habits and changes in eating patterns that have also taken a toll on the lungs. “Lifestyle diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease apart, consuming junk food, rich in preservatives and artificial colours, makes people, especially children, vulnerable to asthma,” said Dr Vijayachandar. The only way to combat the illness is to eat a rich diet of fruits and vegetables to boost immunity, and recognise the symptoms early, he added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

But implementation of smoke-free laws is very poor in UP state. Very low amounts of fines have been collected in very few districts, proper signage is not everywhere, and law-enforcement agencies are not vigilant to implement smoke-free laws. Prof Rama Kant added ""Every person should be able to breathe smoke-free air. Smoke-free laws protect the health of non-smokers, are popular, do not harm business and encourage smokers to quit.""/All people have a fundamental right to breathe clean air. Completely smoke-free indoor environments - with no exceptions - are the only proven way to protect people. 100% smoke-free environments require the elimination of all smoking and tobacco smoke indoors. Ventilation cannot protect against the health risks of tobacco smoke. Smoke-free environments help smokers who want to quit. Teenagers who live in homes where smoking is allowed are nearly twice as likely to start smoking, than those in homes where smoking is prohibited./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Act against conventional pollution, cell tower radiation, experts exhort","Radiation from cellphones and towers is set to become as major a source of pollution as air, water and noise. Skin rashes, hearing problems, sleeplessness, migraines, fatigue, lack of concentration, fearfulness and skin dehydration are among the problems reported by people living in the vicinity of mobile phone towers, which are to be found in every other building in the city. Environmental activists and experts say that citizens and the government must act not only against conventional sources of pollution, but also radiation from cell towers and gadgets./""International studies show that mobile tower radiation may not only be capable of causing cancer, but also neurotic disorders like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s,"" said Manoj Londhe, a member of the Mobile Tower Grievances Forum. ""Worst, prolonged exposure to radiation may cause DNA mutations and so are very dangerous for foetuses."" The forum is part of a growing movement in the city to highlight the risks posed by electromagnetic radiation./Cellphones are a source of distress too. Doctors report receiving cases of up to 50% hearing loss among cellphone users. Dr Divya Prabhat, ENT surgeon with Bhatia and Wadia hospitals, said, ""The most common complaint of patients is that after cellphone use, the ears become hot. Many come with complaints of tinnitus, where there is buzzing in the ears. This results in irritability and lack of concentration.""/That is not to say that hazards by conventional sources of pollution are any less. They have indeed grown. For example, dumping grounds can cause respiratory problems . This was not quite known till KEM Hospital did a study on people living around dumping grounds, especially Deonar, and found that the incidence of respiratory ailments among them was more than among other Mumbaikars./Then, air pollution levels were found to be high in and around Bhuleswar, which has a number of gold-plating units, and suspended particulate matter (SPM) levels in Kurla’s air were found to be high because of construction sites./As for water pollution, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board has said that special studies in Chembur have revealed the presence of copper, chromium, calcium, arsenic and mercury in ground water—an extremely harmful phenomenon. British-era pipes in most areas in the city run parallel to sewage lines and thus are risk of contamination from leaks./Meanwhile, noise pollution has only been increasing. The Central Pollution Control Board has declared Mumbai as the noisiest city in the world. ""Noise over permissible limits is not just about pollution, but also is a health hazard,"" said Sumaira Abduali of the NGO Awaaz. ""Even in non-festival days, noise levels in Mumbai are 117 decibels, whereas as per the WHO, no one should be subjected to more than 80 decibels, that too for eight hours a day.""/Effect of pollution on health/Water: Mumbai’s water is supposedly among the cleanest in the country and conforms to WHO standards at the stage of leaving filtration plants. But by the time it reaches homes, it gathers dirt and pathogens. The city’s water supply gets contaminated especially during the monsoon when it floods in many areas/British-era pipes continue to supply water to most parts of Mumbai. Many of these pipes run parallel to sewage lines. At times there are leaks, which lead to severe contamination and jaundice, typhoid, gastroenteritis and cholera outbreaks/Even mild contamination of water can lead to complications like diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, dryness of skin, excessive thirst, nausea and dehydration/Air: Suspended particulate matter: SPM is a mix of solid and liquid particles, including dust, sand, smoke, lead, nickel and arsenic. It lodges in lung tissues and causes respiratory problems—aggravated asthma and acute respiratory symptoms, including difficult or painful breathing, chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function Sulphur dioxide |/SO2 leads to lung diseases Nitrogen dioxide/NO2 is a reddish-brown toxic gas with a characteristic sharp, biting odour. Its most important sources are internal combustion engines. It makes children susceptible to respiratory diseases, especially in winter, and contributes to the formation of tropospheric ozone, which is a pollutant/Noise: Scientists have conclusively proved that continued exposure to noise pollution not only leads to hearing loss, but also to a greater risk of heart attack, high blood pressure, and even depression/Radiation from cellphones and mobile towers: Skin rashes, hearing problems, sleeplessness, migraine, fatigue, lack of concentration, fearfulness and skin dehydration are a few short-term problems reported by people living in the vicinity of mobile towers International studies have shown that major disorders can be caused by radiation, among them cancer and neurological disorders like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. Most importantly, prolonged exposure to radiation may cause DNA mutations and so is most dangerous to foetuses Excessive cellphone use can cause the deadliest of health hazards among users, from hearing loss to neuro-endocrine disruption, and from hormonal imbalance to cancer./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
14-year-old decision makes breathing easier in Shimla,"SHIMLA: A decision taken 14 years ago to ban the use of coal heaters in the offices and residential buildings of Shimla town has brought in positive results, with a marked improvement in the hill town's air quality. In 1998-99, the Himachal Pradesh Pollution Control Board (HPPCB) had recommended a ban on coal heaters after measuring suspended particulate matter (SPM) level, which was measured 200 microgram per metre cube. The SPM level is now reduced to be in the range of 33-80 microgram per metre cube./To keep a check on the air quality in Shimla, two monitoring stations have been set up at Tekka bench near the Ridge and at the bus stand. The data collected from these stations is examined regularly to keep an eye on the air quality. According to board officials now monthly mean average value of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen at both stations has been found well below the permissible limit./""During winters, witnessing smoke coming out of iron pipes or concrete chimneys was a common sight as no one had thought it could pollute the environment. But in 1998 when we took the air samples of Shimla town the levels of sulphur dioxide, SPM, nitrogen and carbon were found three times more than normal, which was enough to cause lung diseases and cancer,"" said PC Gupta, executive engineer, HPPCB./After this finding, HPPCB then had sent a proposal to state government to discontinue the usage of coal heaters to save city residents from falling prey to diseases caused by air pollution./Pollution control board officials motivated and educated people about the use of kerosene, solar and 'delonghi' heaters. While some accepted the suggestions others like government offices took time to accept the suggestion./Despite the ban imposed on coal heaters in 1998-99, many including government offices continued use the same till 2004, forcing SPCB to take a tough stand to discourage people from their usage./""In 2004, board decided to enforce the environment act and people using coal heaters were warned that if they do not stop its usage then their power supply would be disconnected following which coal heaters were finally discontinued in Shimla,"" Gupta added./Coal heaters (locally called 'angithi' and 'bukhari') were being used in Shimla since the time of British, when a wooden cottage was set up by the then assistant political agent of hill states Lieutenant Ross in 1819, sources said. To beat the cold, people used to switch over to coal heaters from November to March every year until 1998-99./But after the ban everyone has switched over to environment friendly kerosene, LPG and electric heaters./Associate professor (medicine) at Indira Gandhi Medical College, Dr Jitender Mokta, said abandoning the coal heaters was a good step as presence of high SPM in the air could cause severe health problem especially respiratory diseases./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Senior surgeon Professor (Dr) Rama Kant was the keynote guest speaker and interaction was presided over by KB Gurung, Commanding Officer (CO) of 20th UP Girls Battalion Lucknow and Lt Colonel PS Dasauni. This event was jointly organized by 20th Girls' Battalion and Vote For Health campaign of Asha Parivar./Rama Kant said, ""According to the World Health Organization (WHO), just 30 minutes of exposure to tobacco smoke changes the way in which blood flows and clots, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke... scientific evidence has unequivocally established that exposure to tobacco smoke causes death, disease and disability. 6 lakhs out of 60 lakh deaths every year due to tobacco are due to second-hand smoke. As per the global trend, 1 lakh people in India might be dying from breathing second-hand tobacco smoke. About 10 lakh people die of direct tobacco use in India every year.""/Rama Kant said that in adults, second-hand smoke causes serious cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer. In infants, it causes sudden death. In pregnant women, it causes low birth weight. Almost half of children regularly breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke in public places.

Two-thirds of deaths are attributed to major NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, among others"" said Rama Kant who was also the former chief medical superintendent of KGMU. Major causes of NCDs are preventable such as tobacco use, unhealthy diets, alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity./Rama Kant who ran Tobacco Cessation Clinic (TCC) at KGMU further, said ""Studies show that few people understand the specific health risks of tobacco use. For example, a 2009 survey revealed that only 38% of smokers knew that smoking causes coronary heart disease and only 27% knew that it causes stroke. Among smokers who are aware of the dangers of tobacco, most want to quit. Counselling, proper help and evidence-based medication can more than double the chance that a smoker who tries to quit will succeed.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"46% fly ash unused, add to pollution","BHUBANESWAR: Fly ash continues to contribute to environmental hazards in the state with only 54% of the total ash generated from thermal power plants being utilized or disposed of.

High expectations lead to low opinions in tony zones,"CHENNAI: Poes Garden, which chief minister Jayalalithaa, Superstar Rajnikanth and many of the rich and famous call home, isn't seen as the best place to live in. It isn't even among the top 20 best places to live in the city./According to a public perception survey, conducted by The Times of India, on quality of life, ward 118 -which includes Poes Garden, Venus Colony, former chief minister M Karunanidhi's locality Gopalapuram, and other posh parts of Alwarpet - is ranked 60./The question is: Does this reflect government apathy or is just that its residents complain far too much?/One of the surprise findings was that residents who live in the most expensive neighbourhoods are not necessarily satisfied with their quality of life. Ward 118 ranked its satisfaction on every parameter-safety, public transport, water, sanitation, power and open spaces-between 2.1 and 2.8 on a scale of five./Though Teynampet (Zone 9) comes in second overall, many of its wards have ranked themselves lower on the scale of 0 to 5, with 5 being the highest. The Corporation has divided the 15 zones of the city into 200 wards, with each ward comprising a few streets. Chennai Patrol went ward by ward to ask residents to rank their quality of life on six parameters./Other seemingly posh neighbourhoods fared no better than Poes Garden. Ward 111-Khader Nawaz Khan Road, Rutland Gate, Wallace Garden, and other localities with sky-high real estate prices-were even unhappier. The ward, also part of Teynampet zone, came in at 74th place, giving themselves scores ranging from 1.8 to 2.9./So, if the quiet, tree-lined roads with mansions have unsatisfied residents, which is the best place to live in? Turns out, it's ward 52 in the heart of Royapuram, one of the oldest parts of north Chennai, known for air pollution linked to coal handling in the port. Residents ranked themselves highly (more than 4 on 5) on safety and public transport, saying bus services were frequent and it is safe for women and at night./But, many of its residents are surprised by the findings. ""Debris is dumped on either side of Cemetery Road, and Model Lines is dirty and unsafe,"" said G Arun Kumar, who has lived in Sengalvarayan Street in the ward for more than 25 years. ""People drink on the main road and smoke in Robinson Park,"" said K Kabir, a resident of Anjeneyapuram in ward 52./Even Chennai Corporation officials are baffled. ""This is news to me,"" said a senior officer of Royapuram zone. A senior corporation official said Nungambakkam, Greenways Road and Poes Garden have been given every civic amenity because of the VIP residents. ""We ensure that garbage is cleared twice a day, roads are without potholes and water supply is 24 hours,"" said a senior corporation official./Officials suspect that it is the educated cry babies in the posh areas who take facilities for granted and expect more. ""Many places like Adyar, Alwarpet and T Nagar have resident activists who look for avenues to criticise us,"" said a former conservancy worker from Adyar zone./So, what makes residents of ward 52 in Royapuram and ward 40 (Old Washermenpet) in Tondiarpet, which is the third best locality to live in, happier?/""We have been focusing a lot of ward 40, which is dominated by slums,"" said a corporation official from Tondiarpet zone. ""We widened their roads, erected street lights and checked sewage overflow,"" he said. ""Maybe the residents were expressing their gratitude. This motivates us to work harder,"" he added./Defending their activism is residents' associations who say they have brought about major improvements in their areas. ""If residents ranked ward 181 in Adyar, where Kalakshetra Colony is located, the 17th best area to live in, it is because we have fought for two new parks, daily garbage clearance and re-laying of interior roads,"" says Shanthi Krishnan, vice-president of Kalakshetra Colony Welfare Association./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Has Chanda pollution affected wild animals' behaviour?,"CHANDRAPUR: Chandrapur stands second among most polluted places in the country. The health survey carried out way back in 2005-06 over the effect of pollution has revealed that nearly 50% Chandrapurians suffer from one or other kind of respiratory disease./While the hazardous industrial pollution has adversely affected humans, then how bad are the sufferings of wildlife that lives in the forest which is in close vicinity to the industrial area? Is increased aggressiveness and abnormal behaviour of bigger carnivores leading to man-animal conflict in the peripheral villages of Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) the result of adverse effect of neurotoxic pollutants added to air and water of pristine tiger habitat?/These are the questions, environmentalist and wildlife activist, Suresh Chopne has voiced with the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and forest department. Chopne, who is president of NGO Green Planet Society, has forwarded a letter to NTCA member secretary, Rajesh Gopal, along with chief wildlife warden, TATR field director and other forest officials voicing his concerns over the effect of pollution on wildlife. He demanded a detailed survey on impact of high pollution on wildlife in TATR and forests in vicinity of Chandrapur city./""We are well aware of the adverse effect of high pollution from Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station (CSTPS) and other industries in the MIDCs. Government has declared moratorium on new industries in four industrial clusters in Chandrapur to control the deadly effect of pollution on human habitations. But, nobody appears to be concerned about effect of this pollution on the rich wildlife that resides in TATR and its buffer,"" said Chopne./He claimed that CSTPS discharges fly ash and toxic gases comprising carbon dioxide, mercury, SOX, NOX, and other heavy metals in the air. There are highly polluting industries located in Tadali MIDC further adding to air pollution. These industries are located in west and south-west direction of the tiger reserve. The wind blows for over six months in a year from the same direction towards the TATR carrying toxic pollutants to the pristine tiger habitat. The pollution that has proved hazardous to citizens in Chandrapur, puts the rich wildlife in the reserve and its buffer at equal risk, he said./Chopne claimed that fly ash emitting from thermal power plants is particularly hazardous. It carries mercury and heavy metals, which are neurotoxins and have carcinogenic the impact on the body. He speculated that rising aggressiveness of carnivores in buffer area of TATR that has escalated man-animal conflict could be the result of harmful effect of neurotoxins on the wildlife./""Studies carried out by institutions like Atmospheric Pollution Research and Indian Institute of Ecology and Environment have proved that wild animals too are prone to the pollution. Hence it is necessary to study and analyse the harmful effect of pollution on the wildlife,"" he demanded./Chopne held that forest department has chalked out eco-sensitive zone around TATR and forwarded a proposal to union government for approval. The provisions under Wildlife Protection Act and guidelines for conservation and protection of tigers and wildlife in tiger reserve and protected areas seek true safety of the wild animals.

Environmental degradation costing India 5.7% of its GDP: World Bank,"MUMBAI: At a time when many of India's infrastructural projects are caught in the throes of an environment versus development conundrum, a new report released by the World Bank estimates that environmental degradation is costing India around 5.7% of its GDP every year./The report, ""Diagnostic Assessment of Select Environmental Challenges in India"" is the bank's first national economic assessment of environment-related degradation in India. It analysed the losses of environmental health and natural resources, and provided a valuation of biodiversity and ecosystem services in India, among other valuations./""The annual cost of environmental degradation in India amounts to about Rs 3.75 trillion ($80 billion) equivalent to 5.7% of GDP,"" stated the report. Among the highest to blame was pollution, mainly outdoor pollution arising from particulate matter (PM10) that was largely due to the burning of fossil fuels along with the losses due to the lack of access to clean water supply, sanitation and hygiene, stated the report./""The costs for outdoor/indoor air pollution are primarily driven by an elevated exposure of the young and productive urban population to particulate matter pollution. This results in a substantial cardiopulmonary and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease mortality load among adults,"" stated the authors of the report in a press note./The report was meant to underline the need for India to green its growth.

Air pollution costing economy Rs 3.75L crore a year: World Bank,"NEW DELHI: Only outdoor air pollution in urban areas claims 1.09 lakh lives of adults, another 7,513 of children below 5 years annually, says a latest report of World Bank. The study released on Wednesday revealed that the annual cost of environmental degradation in India is about Rs 3.75 lakh crores, which is equivalent to 5.7% of country’s GDP./The study commissioned by the Central government has brought out how urban growth centres in the country are choking and claims that outdoor and indoor air pollution have the maximum share of this annual burden on India’s economy. According to the estimates of the multilateral bank, outdoor air pollution accounts for 29%, followed by indoor air pollution (23%), cropland degradation (19%), water supply and sanitation (14%), pasture (11%) and forest degradation (4%)./This first ever national level economic assessment of environmental degradation in India focuses on particle pollution (PM10) from burning of fossil fuels, which has serious health consequences amounting up to 3% of India’s GDP along with losses due to lack of access to clean water supply, sanitation and hygiene besides natural resources depletion. The indoor air pollution is mainly due to burning of wood, mainly in rural India./PM10 stands for Particulate Matter up to 10 micrometers in size and include smoke, dirt and dust from factories, construction sites, farming and roads. According to the bank, annually over 3.7 lakh hospital admissions are reported in India due to outdoor air pollution in urban areas./Bank’s environmental economist Muthukumara Mani said, ""The productive part of the population that gets impacted from air pollution in cities, if you can save them, it is going to add up in terms of productivity, in terms of GDP,"" he stated./The study claims that nearly 25% of child mortality cases in India can be attributed to environmental degradation and due to inadequate availability of clean water and sanitation./Mani said that small steps can help improve the situation in a big way. ""Improving the efficiency of a power plant, which is a major cause of air pollution in India. For example, washing coal is a simple process - not too expensive - which can also help in not only improving the efficiency of coal, but also save a lot of lives,"" he said./According to the report, India can make green growth a reality by putting in place strategies to reduce environmental degradation at the minimal cost of.02% to .04% of average annual GDP growth rate./The World Bank has already put out such assessments for countries like Ghana and China, and hopes Centre will realize that there cannot be trade-off between economic growth and protecting country’s natural resources and citizens’ health./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"As respiratory diseases rise among kids, doctors sound alarm","MUMBAI: The growing incidence of severe respiratory ailments caused by air pollution has doctors in the city worried. They say that, as more children fall victim, the problem warrants urgent attention./In the last few years, respiratory diseases have become among the top five killers in Mumbai. Deaths due to respiratory tract infections-such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders (COPD) and bronchial asthma-rose by 20.2% in 2010 and then relatively stabilized. As per civic data, around 3,686 people succumbed to respiratory diseases in 2011 and about 3,365 in 2012. Pneumonia alone claimed over 8,000 lives in 2011 and 2012./Respiratory physician Dr Sujeet Rajan, who consults at Bombay and Bhatia hospitals, feels the doctors in the field have never been so busy. ""One in 10 people in the city has asthma,"" he said, explaining that the pollution emitted by automobiles and from construction sites is the biggest cause of worry. ""Those living close to construction sites are highly exposed. Most of the city is bearing the brunt of this affliction.""/Dr Rajan added that prolonged exposure to construction-linked pollution can lead to hypersensitive pneumonitis and, in extreme cases, lung fibrosis. High levels of pollutants in the air worsens the condition of individuals with pre-existing lung disease. Further, international studies have found that increased levels of nitrogen dioxide, emitted from vehicle exhaust, directly lead to increased COPD hospitalisations./The head of respiratory medicine at Sion Hospital, Dr N T Awad, said the incidence of asthma among children in Mumbai is as high as 10% to 12%; ""those in the age group of 6 to 12 years are most vulnerable. Of course, the diagnosis in children less than six years remains vague"". He added that the incidence of respiratory ailments in children as well as adults has been increasing alarmingly, necessitating adoption of better lifestyles./The growth in lung problems can be gauged by the fact that most city physicians, particularly chest specialists, treat at least 18-20 cases of respiratory ailments every day. The numbers of patients seeking treatment from general physicians is likely to be much more. ""The incidence is definitely on the rise because causative agents are increasing,"" said Dr Ashish Tiwari, CEO of Zynova Hospital. Also a physician, Tiwari added that curbing pollution is the key: ""we need to promote vehicles with less emissions and advocate use of public transport.""/Quoting a Pune-based study, Rajan said trains are the best way to travel as exposure to pollution in them is the least. ""Next would be taxis as one can roll up the windows. Worst are autorickshaws, where exposure to pollution is the highest,"" he concluded./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

India must look at green growth: World Bank report,"MUMBAI: India can make green growth a reality by putting in place strategies to reduce environmental degradation at the minimal cost of 0.02% to 0.04% of average annual GDP growth rate. According to a new World Bank report released today, this will allow India to maintain a high pace of economic growth without jeopardizing future environmental sustainability./The report titled, ""Diagnostic Assessment of Select Environmental Challenges in India"" is the first-ever national level economic assessment of environmental degradation in India. It analyzes the physical and monetary losses of environmental health and natural resources; the tradeoffs between economic growth and environmental sustainability; and provides a valuation for biodiversity and ecosystem services in India./According to the assessment done by the authors of the report, the annual cost of environmental degradation in India amounts to about Rs 3.75 trillion ($80 billion) equivalent to 5.7% of GDP. It focuses on particle pollution (PM10) from the burning of fossil fuels, which has serious health consequences amounting to up to three per cent of India's GDP along with losses due to lack of access to clean water supply, sanitation and hygiene and natural resources depletion./Of this, the impacts of outdoor air pollution account for the highest share at 1.7% followed by cost of indoor air pollution at 1.3%. The higher costs for outdoor/indoor air pollution are primarily driven by an elevated exposure of the young and productive urban population to particulate matter pollution that results in a substantial cardiopulmonary and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality load among adults. Further, a significant portion of diseases caused by poor water supply, sanitation and hygiene is borne by children under 5. About 23% of child mortality in the country could be attributed to environmental degradation, the report says./""Like in many other countries, the debate over growth versus environment is also active in India. This report suggests there are low-cost options that could significantly bring down environmental damage without compromising long-term growth objectives,"" said Onno Ruhl, World Bank country director in India. ""The costs of doing this are not only affordable in the long-term but would also be offset by the significant health and productivity benefits.""/Failure to act now could also constrain long-term productivity and hence India's economic growth prospects, the report says./""Grow now and clean up later will not be environmentally sustainable for India in the long run,"" said Muthukumara S. Mani, a senior environmental economist at the World Bank and the lead author of the report. ""We believe that a low-emission, resource-efficient greening of the economy is possible at a very low cost in terms of GDP growth.""/Green growth is affordable/The study models several scenarios to show that. According to the study, a 10% particulate emission reduction by 2030 will lower GDP modestly, representing a loss of merely 0.3% to the GDP compared to business as usual. On the other hand, a 30% particulate emission reduction lowers GDP about $97 billion, or 0.7% with very little impact on the growth rates./There are significant health benefits under both scenarios. The savings from reduced health damages range from $105 billion in the 30% case to $24 billion with a 10% reduction. This, to a large extent, compensates for the projected GDP loss./The report also emphasizes that green growth is measurable and important as India is a hotspot of unique biodiversity and ecosystems. The study undertook a first-ever comprehensive assessment of value of ecosystem services from various biomes across India./Based on conservative estimates, it amounts to about 3.0% to 5.0% of GDP. ""Conventional measures of growth do not adequately capture the environmental costs, which have been found to be particularly severe at the current rapid growth rates. There are also tools available now to estimate the significant contribution of natural capital in the form of ecosystem services. Therefore, it is imperative to calculate green Gross Domestic Product (green GDP) as an index of economic growth with the environmental costs and services factored in,"" Mani added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Incense smoke hits lungs, can trigger asthma","LONDON: Incense smoke, common in Indian homes, has been found to be harmful to human lungs. Burning incense generates indoor air pollutants that cause inflammation in human lung cells, researchers from the University of North Carolina say. The researchers analyzed particulate concentrations and levels of gases such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and formaldehyde./Human lung cells were placed in a chamber to expose them to the smoke, then incubated for 24 hours to allow particulates to settle and the cells to respond. The resulting inflammatory response , a hallmark of asthma and other respiratory problems, was similar to that of lung cells exposed to cigarette smoke./Incense is burned weekly in about 94% of households in the UAE and in majority of houses in India for worship as well as to remove cooking odours. Since people there spend more than 90% of their time indoors, researchers said, indoor air pollution has become a source of rising concern./Researchers found that most types of incense emitted significant amounts of particles, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and oxides of nitrogen, resulting in the inflammatory response./Indoor air pollution (IAP) is already claiming 500,000 lives in India every year, most of whom are women and children. According to the World Health Organisation, India accounts for 80% of the 600,000 premature deaths that occur in south-east Asia annually due to exposure to IAP./The study, by the Gillings School of Global Public Health, involved testing over three hours in an indoor chamber with a high concentration of smoke./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
