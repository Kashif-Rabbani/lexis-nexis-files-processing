Survey shows Indore ahead in awareness concerning environment,"BHOPAL: Surprising though it may appear, it is environment over development for Indoreans. The commercial capital of the state is much more environment conscious and ahead of Delhi where only 50% of citizens would like the government to prioritize environmental protection over its development objectives./Ahead of World Environment Day on June 5, a survey conducted by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) revealed that 65% of Indoreans put environment before development. Besides, 90% were in favour of banning polythene bags./TERI, an independent research institute, had conducted the survey on overall environment, water and waste management through interviews of 11,214 respondents across Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Kanpur, Indore, Jamshedpur, Guwahati and Coimbatore between December 2013 and February 2014. Of this, 1,244 Indoreans were surveyed./On the issue of trade-offs between environment and development, majority of respondents either felt that the two went hand in hand like in Coimbatore and Guwahati or that the environment should be prioritized over development like in Mumbai (44%), Delhi, and Kanpur (45%). However, a higher percentage in Pune (37%) and Jamshedpur (42%) felt that development should be prioritized over the environment./More than 50% of Indoreans felt that air quality (51%), drinking water quality (48%), and groundwater availability (38%) had worsened in the last five years. In contrast, a considerable section of the respondents felt that green cover (35%), surface water quality and availability (43%), and drinking water availability (56%) had improved over the same span of time. 65% attributed a variety of respiratory diseases to poor environmental quality./Fewer women (26%) and (53%) perceived an improvement in drinking water quality and availability, respectively as compared to 33% and 57% of men./Besides, 80% and 69% of the citizens felt that temperature and rainfall had increased, respectively and 87% of the respondents felt that climate change and global warming was occurring./Around one-third of Indoreans felt that policies pertaining to air pollution (32%), water pollution (36%), water supply (32%), water conservation (41%), and waste management (31%) existed and were well implemented. However, as high as 55% and 45% citizens of Indore felt that there were no policies for climate change and groundwater usage, respectively. One-fourth felt policies concerning forest conservation were either inadequate or not implemented./Leakage of water during distribution was identified as the primary cause of wastage of water by 61% Indoreans followed by leakages from taps/faucets in homes (19%). Over 90% of the respondents were aware of the subsidized price of water, and 92% were of the opinion that users should be charged actual cost of water./Half of those surveyed conveyed the best strategy to manage the problem of solid waste was to improve waste recycling capacity followed by generating less waste at household level (27%) while 45% felt that mandatory laws pertaining to recycling can greatly promote re-use./Only 58% of the survey respondents expressed willingness to segregate waste before disposal. People were aware of the problem of e-waste. Very few respondents said they threw e-waste along with the household garbage./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Soaring heat wave leading to deadly ozone pollution: CSE,"LUCKNOW: Summer pollution curve has taken an ugly turn as ground-level ozone, a highly reactive and harmful gas, far exceeds the permissible limit. With heat wave raging in early June ozone has peaked to dangerous levels. Rising NOx levels and volatile gases in the air, primarily from vehicles, form the recipe for ozone when exposed to intense sunlight and high temperature./Ozone is a serious threat to those suffering from asthma and respiratory problems and can cause premature deaths if it is high even for a short duration during the day. Delhi has witnessed a significant ozone build-up this summer, says a latest analysis done byCentre for Science and Environment (CSE)./A study of the real-time air quality data available from the key monitoring locations of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) for the period January to early June 2014, shows rapid build-up of ozone and more frequent violation of standards this summer. CSE cautions Delhi needs to act fast to reduce the cocktail of gases that are forming ozone in the air. Its government must fast track pollution alert system and next generation air pollution control measures, says CSE./CSE experts saywarmer temperatures and the extreme heat waves are threatening to increase the frequency of days with unhealthy levels of ozone - with serious public health consequences./Ground-level ozone is not directly emitted by any source. This is formed when oxides of nitrogen (NO X) and a range of volatile gases, primarily from vehicles and other sources are exposed to each other in sunlight. Warm and stagnant air increases the formation of ozone, which is known to be extremely hazardous for human health./According to Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy and head of CSE's air pollution programme, ""Ozone is the new generation public health threat and a difficult challenge. It must be curbed at the early stages with stringent controls on nitrogen oxide (NOx) and toxic and volatile gases, the major ingredients of ozone recipe.""/Ozone is an extremely harmful gas, particularly for those involved in outdoor activities. Just a few hours of exposure to it can trigger serious health problems, especially among those who are already suffering from respiratory and asthmatic problems. Ozone worsens symptoms of asthma, leads to lung function impairment and damages lung tissues. Chest pain, coughing, nausea, headaches and chest congestion are common symptoms. It can even worsen heart disease, bronchitis and emphysema./Ozone is included in the daily smog and health alert programmes in countries such as Mexico, the US and China. Roychowdhury says, ""Explosive increase in vehicle numbers, especially diesel vehicles that spew much higher levels of NOx and volatile organic compounds, can only worsen the deadly recipe needed for formation of ozone in the city with hot and extreme climate.""/The body said that the city government must prevent this trend by making serious efforts to control NOx and volatile organic compounds that largely come from vehicles. It must make efforts to reduce numbers of vehicles, especially diesel ones. The city government can also introduce a daily health alert system to inform the sensitive population about the high daily levels and enforce emergency pollution control measures such as reducing traffic volume, etc./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Poisonous gases welcome subah-e-Banaras, joggers","VARANASI: The grandeur of the evening 'Ganga aarti' on the banks of the Ganga and the panoramic sunrise (Subeh-e-Banaras) attract scores of tourists from across the world. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has lived the evening and performed the Ganga aarti but he is still missing the morning charm./But the flip side is that the mornings apart from panoramic sunrise bring along the pollution caused by the burning the municipal waste along the roadside.Therefore, the morning walkers who go out for fresh air are instead exposed to toxic gases emanated from the solid waste burning on the roads./It is a common practice followed by safai workers in many parts of the city here. Instead of proper disposal of solid waste, the safai workers of the city burn it in open on roadside and narrow lanes flouting the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2013./This unscientific disposal of waste increases air pollution and causes health problems. ""Burning municipal wastes in open adds toxic gases in the atmosphere. Besides, burning waste in narrow lanes is more dangerous and health hazardous as there is no free flow of air due to high rising buildings,"" said Prof BD Tripathi, environmental scientist at Banaras Hindu University (BHU). According to him, biomass waste can be found in municipal waste and agricultural waste. Burning biomass creates black carbon, which is soot, smoke, and particulate matter resulting from the incomplete combustion of biomass. It is the responsibility of the municipal corporation to take care of city's environment as well as people's health, he said./The report of Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) on city's solid waste management suggests that the bio-medical waste is also disposed off along with the municipal solid waste, which goes unmonitored. Inefficient burning of garbage also leaves behind a huge quantity of toxins including dioxins and heavy metals both in the form of fly out ashes and residue left behind./But, no action has been taken yet by the municipal authorities to stop safai workers from burning swept waste in open. Mayor Ram Gopal Mohale admitted that many safai workers are indulged in burning garbage in open./He, however, added that FIR would be lodged against the erring employees. ""The municipal supervisors have been asked for strict monitoring and taking appropriate action to stop this practice,"" he told TOI. Efforts are also being made to make people aware people of their rights./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Garbage yard fumes again, residents choke","TRICHY: Firefighters are struggling to put down smoke that is billowing from the garbage yard at Ariyamangalam from Sunday morning. The billowing smoke has engulfed nearby residential areas, causing inconvenience to people who faced a similar ordeal last year as well./Air pollution from the garbage yard situated on 40-acre land on Thanjavur Road is an old and recurring issue. Occasionally, the problem worsens when the garbage catches fire./Nearly 400 tonnes of garbage collected from 65 wards within the municipal corporation area are dumped in the yard. On Sunday morning, the smoke started rising from the yard. Corporation officials are yet to ascertain the reason for the latest incident, though it is assumed burning garbage in the pile is the factor./Meanwhile, residents are struggling to evade smoke. ""We are cursed to breathe the smoke which causes health hazards. But we have no other alternative, except stay in the area. We are accustomed to inhaling the smoke,"" said H Syed, a resident of Ariyamangalam./On Sunday morning, the fire service personnel quickly rushed to the spot with two fire tenders. As the smoke intensified in a few hours the fire brigade brought six more vehicles from Srirangam, Navalpattu, Manapparai,/Keeranur, Iluppur and Pudukkottai to douse the smoke. ""We are trying to extinguish the fire within a couple of days. We learnt a lesson from the bitter experience we had last year. Hence, we have intensified efforts to contain the smoke at the earliest,"" said divisional fire officer S Syed Mohammed./It may be recalled that the area adjoining the yard experienced severe air pollution. Smoke from the yard had engulfed the entire stretch from Ariyamangalam to the oil mill area on Thanjavur Road for several days last year in May and August. Subsequently, residents even launched protests against the corporation while demanding the shifting of the yard elsewhere./Fire service department had also advised the corporation to take some measures to contain the smoke soon. However, the corporation is yet to take any initiative in this regard./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Ariyamangalam fumes refuse to die,"TRICHY: All garbage vehicles coming to the garbage yard at Ariyamangalam were stopped by the residents on Tuesday as a mark of protest. Meanwhile, firefighters are struggling to control the fumes which are arising from the burning garbage pile for the third consecutive day./Angry residents compelled the corporation commissioner V P Thandapani to arrive at the spot to find a solution to the problem. The protest was carried out amid the deployment of large contingent of police. The commissioner pacified the irate locals by assuring that the entire issue will be sorted out in a few months. ""Scientific capping of the entire yard will be done. A consultative meeting in this regard will be held with all civic officials very soon,"" Thandapani said./Residents urged the commissioner to at least stop vehicles from dumping garbage in the ground till fire is contained./Protesters demanded the relocation of the garbage dump considering air pollution and consequent health hazards. They were seen holding their noses considering the stench from the 47-acre dump yard./Manjula S, a protesting resident from Kalyanaraman Street, spoke about the health troubles due to air pollution. ""Many nearby residents have breathing troubles as smoke pervades the area for the third day. Our demand to shift the dumping yard to an alternative site has been falling only on deaf ears. With recurring fires a permanent solution is a must,"" she said. Some residents doubted that they have developed scabies, a contagious skin infection. Even skin is wearing away, they said. Scabies is an extremely itchy skin disorder that leads to a rash. It is caused by an infestation with a parasite -- the scabies mite./Meanwhile, motorists plying on the road near the garbage yard face visibility issues with the smoke resembling a fog./Smoke has been billowing continuously from the garbage pile, though about 60 fire personnel have been deployed to contain the fire./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"One in 68 children autistic, US study says","NEW DELHI: Till about 20 years ago, autism was considered a rare neuro-developmental disorder with one in over 1,000 children being diagnosed with it. Not anymore. Recent data released from USA's Center for Disease Control and Prevention quoted the prevalence of autism at an alarming one in 68 children in March 2014. In year 2012, the figures stood at one in 88./Autism clinics run by Delhi hospitals, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), have also reported a sharp rise in cases./According to Dr Sheffali Gulati, professor and chief, division of child neurology at the premier medical institute, from year 2002-05, they (AIIMS autism clinic) used to get approximately 2-3 cases of autism every month. ""Between years 2005 and 2008, it went up to approximately 4-5 cases per month. And from 2008 till date, a total of 492 children (7-8 cases per month) have been identified with autism spectrum disorder and are under follow-up. Additionally, 8-10 cases are diagnosed every month but are not under regular follow up because they are far-off or suffer from other co-morbidities,"" Dr Gulati said./It is estimated that close to 10 million people in India suffer from autism and related disorders-for which there is no cure. Behavioural intervention is the mainstay for treatment./A recent study published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives said exposure to air pollution damages the brain, affecting the same area of the brain that is known to play a role in autism and schizophrenia in human beings. Their study was based on experiments conducted on animal models./AIIMS, Dr Gulati said, has conducted several studies to know the reason behind this alarming increase but no conclusive evidence has been found. ""We looked into the role of heavy metals and depression in mothers of children with autism but the results were inconclusive,"" the doctor added./However, researchers confirm that increased numbers cannot be linked to awareness and better diagnostics only./Professor V K Paul, head of the department of paediatrics at AIIMS, said addressing the problem of autism is the need of the hour especially as the global public health community is now moving to prepare for the post-Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 2015 agenda wherein such disorders will have an important priority./Dr Praveen Suman Mehta, director of Child Development Clinic at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said till about 10 years ago autism was a rare disorder. ""We rarely saw patients suffering from the condition. But now, we see 3-4 patients every OPD day,"" she said. Dr Mehta added there is no cure for autism but early identification of such cases can help in improving the deficits through targeted therapies./AIIMS doctors say while there are several treatment methods being experimented with, including stem cell therapy, only behavioural intervention has proved successful in controlling symptoms such as impairment in eye-to-eye contact, facial expression, body posture and gestures which are displayed by those with autism./The global prevalence of autism, according to a Center for Disease Control (CDC) report, has increased twentyfold to thirtyfold since the earliest epidemiologic studies were conducted in the late 1960s and early 1970s. At that time, prevalence estimates from European studies were one in 2,500 children in the population, and by the 2000s prevalence estimates from large surveys were 1%-2% of all children."
"Delhi tops the country in fatal road accidents and pedestrians and cyclists falling victim, claims CSE","LUCKNOW: About 16 people die and 58 are injured every hour in India due to road accidents – the death rate, in fact, is equivalent to wiping out about 40 per cent of the population of a small nation like Maldives in a year. And Delhi has the highest number of fatal accidents among all cities, with five deaths per day./The share of fatal accidents in the total is up from 18 percent in 2003 to 25 in 2012. Delhi records an average of five road accident deaths per day – four of these are of pedestrians and two-wheeler riders. Every week, two cyclists and one car rider dies in Delhi. The worst accident hotspots have been detected near flyovers and junctions./Metro cities record very high rates, but numbers are increasing in smaller cities as well: Highly motorised cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi and Bengaluru top the list with the highest numbers of injuries and deaths as recorded by the Union ministry of road transport and highways. Mumbai has the highest number of all types of accidents, while Delhi records largest number of fatal accidents among all cities. Studies now indicate that smaller cities that have newly built highways, show increasing vehicle conflict and accident risks— Lucknow, Vadodara and Agra are some examples./CSE claims that cities are designing roads to increase speed of motor vehicles but at the same time neglecting infrastructure and rights of walkers, cyclists and public transport users. “If road safety is compromised, cities cannot increase the share of sustainable modes such as walk, cycle and public transport for clean air and public health”, cautioned the organization./The assessments indicate that despite the nominal reduction in total number of accidents over the last two decades, the share of fatal road accidents have increased phenomenally as Indian cities are giving more importance to high speed roads for vehicles – and not to ensuring safe access for all, say CSE researchers. CSE released its analysis at a recent workshop titled ‘Our Safe Right to Way – Addressing safety and accessibility in Indian cities.”/Tragic statistics are piling up and several recent gruesome incidents have sent shock waves, necessitating immediate intervention for zero tolerance. The untimely death of the rural development minister Gopinath Munde in a road accident was a grim reminder of the dangerous trend in the city. Even children going to school are not spared. The brunt of this harsh fate falls on the very large number of people cycling and walking on the city’s roads, as well as those who use public transport./Sunita Narain, director general says: “Unsafe roads are a warning against the goals of sustainable mobility practices. Walk, cycle, and public transport will not work if people are not safe, and are injured or die while traveling.” She adds that the assessment becomes necessary at a time when cities are trying to increase their share of public transport along with walking and cycling with the aim of getting clean air, protecting public health, and reducing fuel guzzling and climate impacts./The recent estimates of Global Burden of Disease (GBD) has changed the way health impacts of motorisation are conventionally understood, by including deaths and illnesses from road accidents as well as air pollution within its ambit. The GBD report ranks road injuries as the world’s eighth leading cause of death and the number one killer of young people aged 15 to 24. If deaths due to road injuries and air pollution from vehicles are combined, then they exceed the tally from HIV, tuberculosis or malaria. The World Health Organization (WHO) now classifies disability, unproductive life years, and premature deaths related to road injuries as a significant health impact of motorisation./Explosive trend in Indian cities: As much as 11 per cent of the global road injury deaths occur annually in India alone. India also displays a very disturbing trend -- over the last two decades, while the total number of accidents and injury shows only a small downward dip, fatalities have increased very sharply. The proportion of fatal accidents in total road accidents is up from 18 per cent in 2003 to 25 per cent in 2012 (as per official data). More people are dying now as cities allow vehicles to have more speed on roads, while depriving people of safe access to these same roads./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Kids under severe allergy attack,"KOLKATA: Ten-year-old Sreyas Jain has been suffering from a skin rash that got worse despite treatment. His parents took him for an allergy profile test after no conventional medicine worked. The small, red pimple-like eruptions couldn't be linked to anything specific, though. Much to the relief of Sreyas and his parents, they vanished just as suddenly as they had appeared./Several students of a school in south Kolkata have been suffering from dry cough and breathing difficulty. Even though the symptoms are close to asthma, doctors examining the children felt it was a virulent, contagious allergic condition. Around a dozen students were asked to stay at home till they have recovered completely./A large number of kids, especially those in primary schools, are suffering from pollution-related allergies forcing them to stay off school. While for some it is breathing distress, some have skin lesions. Many have throat infection leading to voice loss, others have indigestion leading to frequent vomiting. Still others have an acute eye infection causing redness and watering. Fever is an added problem./While most would tend to think that these would be viral attacks, in reality they are not. The doctors' certificates that schools are receiving say that the kids have fallen victims to allergens that can be directly linked to air or water pollution. A large number of kids are also allergic to certain food varieties. Earlier one would hear only of milk or lactose intolerance, or allergies induced by brinjal or prawn. Now there is an increasing number suffering from wheat allergy, many who are intolerant to some vegetable groups like spinach or citrus fruits and certain kinds of fish. Even fruits have been leading to severe allergy attacks./""Pesticides, colouring agents and preservatives used on fruits, vegetables and even fish could be triggering these. But what could be more dangerous is air pollution. We are not aware of the pollutants that we are breathing in. Children are being affected more severely and more often than adults,"" said Shantanu Ray, paediatrician./Atopy or skin allergy induced by dryness was largely a western disease, he pointed out. ""It only happened to white children and we rarely encountered the disease in the sub-continent. But now, it is quite common among children in Kolkata. It has been affecting those in the age group of six months to five years,"" said Ray./""Monsoon is the time when primary school kids suffer from cold, cough and fever. But this year we have noticed that many are also suffering from breathing distress and rashes. These kids do not otherwise have asthma and so the complaint was worrying. Later doctors have detected dust allergen related breathing distress to be the cause,"" said TH Ireland, principal of St James School./In some schools, children have complained of contact dermatitis. Initially schools, inexperienced about such allergies, asked parents to keep the affected kids at home, fearing that these might be contagious. Consultant dermatologists have however assured schools that these are not contagious but will take time to subside./Allergic cough and cold, too, have been very frequent this season. Paediatricians pointed out that number of cases has been on the rise over the past few years. It could be linked to pollution. There has been a phenomenal rise in the number of children suffering from allergies, according to paediatrician Ashok Mittal. ""It is a matter of concern since it increases the risk of potentially fatal respiratory diseases or severe allergic reactions (Anaphylactic reactions). The more common forms of allergic diseases in children are atopic dermatitis (eczema), food allergy (nut, gluten), allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and asthma. A combination of genetics and the environment are responsible for this""/In recent years, allergies triggered by food or the environment have risen sharply all across the globe, including Indian children, especially among more affluent families, pointed out Mittal. ""The reason behind is not known. One of the most popular explanations is the ""Hygiene Hypothesis,"" which suggests the cleanliness of urban lifestyles has taken away many of the infectious agents that strenghthens a child's immune system, making it prone to allergic overreaction. Other possible culprits include pollen increases from global warming, environmental toxins, common medications and changes in diet,"" he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

The health team studied 209 permanent residents, aged between one and 74 years, staying within 200 metres of the factories./""We found that cough was the most common health problem in 44.5% of the people, followed by skin diseases in 11.5%. In most of the people (91%) cough was of less than 2 weeks' duration. Other common health problem included asthma (5.7%), anaemia (2.4%) fever (2%) and diarrhoea (1.4%),"" said the report that was submitted in April this year./""Most of the people subjectively complained that the effluent coming out of the ASG Biochem factory was highly obnoxious in smelling. The effluent was being discharged in the Ganganagar Khal. Besides, the fumes discharged from the chimney of Delta Fabrics Pvt Ltd and the Unistar Galvanisers and Fabricators Pvt Ltd now named Industrial Perforation are alleged to contain heavy particulate carbonaceous materials which are deposited inside the rooms of the residents. This cause discomfort even in living indoors,"" the report said./The health survey report recommended an environmental survey to assess the outdoor air and water quality of the area, especially pertaining to suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the air and quality of the underground water. The assistant chief medical officer of health, Barasat, wrote this in the report./Former state pollution control board law officer and now a legal aid activist, Biswajit Mukherjee, wrote a latter to the additional chief secretary of the environment department and member secretary of the Pollution Control Board for taking necessary action against the polluting industrial units as per the provision of Water (prevention and control of pollution) Act 1981 along with Municipal Act for redress of the grievances of locals./Considering the report of the health department, Mukherjee said, the factories are not at all eligible to operate in the present location and need to be shifted. On behalf of the local people, Mukherjee had requested the authority to act against these units by June. ""Since that did not happen, we are now contemplating to move the appropriate forum for justice,"" said Chinmoy Chanda, a local resident spearheading the campaign./Chanda's campaign twice led the state pollution control board to issue closure notices against Unister Galvanisers and Fabricators in 2002 and 2003.

"Metro Rail work adding to air pollution in Hyderabad, says Pollution Control Board","HYDERABAD: The ongoing Metro Rail construction is not only causing widespread traffic chaos in the twin cities, but is perhaps responsible for alarming rise in air pollution over the last two years, AP Pollution Control Board (APPCB) scientists said./Coinciding with the beginning of the metro construction, particulate matter containing toxic metals was 45 % higher than the standard levels set by government of India both during 2012 and 2013, APPCB officials said after analyzing the latest data./Scientists say these particulate matter contains lead, arsenic and nickel, besides other dust particles, which are harmful and trigger respiratory diseases, cancer and disorders related to the nervous system. Respiratory diseases are shooting up in the city by around 15 per cent annually./While no specific survey has been carried out to check the extent of damage on the ambient air quality caused by the Metro Rail construction, officials attribute the sudden and drastic increase in the particulate matter during 2012 and 2013 to haphazard Metro works./“We cannot deny that Metro Rail construction has led to increase in pollution levels,” said Ramesh Chandra, senior environmental scientist, APPCB./As per the national air quality standards, particulate matter 10 (dust particle) should not cross an annual average of 60 ug/m3 (micrograms per cubic meter of air), but APPCB data shows that Hyderabad recorded an all-time high of 87 ug/m3 in 2012 and 2013, when Metro work was in full swing. The 2013 annual average of 87 ug/m3 is 45% and much higher than the standard level, scientists say./Studies have shown that nearly 50% of the particulate matter is due to vehicular pollution and combustion of fuels./This, P Veeranna, a scientific officer with the APPCB, says worsened after haphazard Metro Rail works caused more bottlenecks in the city’s roads, leading to traffic congestion and in-turn contributing to higher levels of pollution. Bad roads too are further adding to the problem, he added./“We had asked Metro authorities to take precautions wherever possible,” said Veeranna./But experts say proper norms to minimize environmental damage were not followed by Metro authorities./“Metro work is supposed to begin after necessary right of way (road width) is created for free flow of traffic, but the work started even before this. Narrow streets were barricaded and works taken up with no alternative plans in place,” said professor C Ramachandraiah of the Centre for Economic and Social Sciences, a city-based think tank./Ramachandraiah, who has closely followed the Metro Rail project, said nobody bothered about vital issues of public health. “What people should expect in the next few years is increasing respiratory problems and overall degeneration of health by the time the project is completed in 2017.”/Officials suggest the urgent need for coordination between transport and roads and buildings departments as well as GHMC, HMDA, RTC and PCB to keep a tab on the rising pollution levels./When contacted, Metro Rail spokesperson Murali Mohan said there was no question of increase in pollution levels because of Metro works. He said the construction activity started in 2011 with all safeguards in place to protect the environment and added that the 72 km corridor would be completed by 2017. Another senior official said he could not comment until he analysed the APPCB data./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"As 'dirty' factories thrive, toxins spread across Delhi","NEW DELHI: Industrial pollution is not restricted to the peripheries but is silently causing damage inside the city. On the Edge, a study by an NGO, has identified 18 potential pollution hotspots in the capital./Unsafe, and often unorganized, methods of e-waste dismantling, dyeing, lead acid battery recycling, cathode-ray tube (CRT) dismantling and other processes have given rise to health and environmental concerns, says the Toxics Link study. Delhi has more than 1.2 lakh industries and 29 industrial estates, necessitating a watch over acid and lead fumes, as well as groundwater and air pollution./The researchers assessed 51 industrial areas on five parameters--industrial processes, chemicals used, emissions, disposal technique and occupational health hazard. They found that 18 of them were flouting the norms./Prem Nagar in Mandoli houses 110 lead acid battery recycling units. There is no understanding of pollution control, claims the report. ""Most units in this area rely on coalto-fuel crude furnaces and recover lead in a crude manner./While recycling, battery acid is dumped on the ground, waste pile or into a waterbody. As lead plates are melted, lead ash settles in the surroundings, collects on clothing or is inhaled by workers,"" it says./A large amount of waste at Seelampur, where e-waste is recycled, comes from the US and Europe. Workshops emit lead fumes and the melted lead solder often finds its way to nearby drains. ""The working conditions are appalling with poorly ventilated rooms and no safety measures,"" says the report about Moti Nagar, which recycles CFL devices./The landfills at Ghazipur, Bhalswa and Okhla are responsible for toxic leachate contamination of air and groundwater. The Najafgarh drain basin, which includes Wazirpur, Naraina, Anand Parbat and Okhla industrial areas, is the largest surface drain joining Yamuna and contributes to over 50% of the wastewater discharged into the river. Wazirpur is one of the worst managed areas with 1,200 small units, a majority of which are involved in steel pickling. The report also highlights the need to address toxic smoke and dust from open dumping, burning and spilling of chemicals. ""In 2011, MCD was supposed to close down around 22,000 units, but not much seems to have been done"" said Satish Sinha of Toxics Link./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Amritsar Vikas Manch seeks government sponsored drive to root out Congress grass,"AMRITSAR: Amritsar Vikas Manch (AVM) has demanded from Deputy Commission to launch a government sponsored campaign to eradicate congress grass (Parthenium Hysterochorus), Sukha (Canabis Sativa) and Bhang (Verbesina Prostrata) weeds which has grown on the road sides, farms, pastures and vacant land of the city and whole district. AVM held a meeting here on Friday under the presidentship of Kulwant Singh Ankhi./Speaking on the occasion he said Congress grass was an invasive species in India and was kept in the list of noxious weeds. Its out break had been almost as epidemic which effects crop production, live stock and human health. This weed inhibits the fruit set process in brinjal, tomato and beans etc. This weed was also responsible for the production of bitter milk when eaten by the milking animals. It could also trigger pollen allergies in human beings. The pollen grains produced in abundant quantity from the flowers of this weed was also a cause of air pollution which was very dangerous for the patients of asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory diseases, he added./Besides respiratory tract the pollen grains of this weed also causes skin problems. Along this weed Sukha and Bhang has also grown in abundant quantities. As per Ayurvada Sukha and Bhang has 'Garm & Khushak Nature' which effects badly the tissues of brain and other body parts. the metabolic rate of human body was increased which causes ailments and disease, when this weed was taken. It was also used as intoxicant by the drug addicts he said./""So keeping in view the health of citizens and maintaining the quality of air which is already very polluted, these harmful and unpleasant weeds must be uprooted at the earliest possible. The best way to get rid of these noxious weeds is to uproot these as the soil is very soft and loose these rainy days "" said Ankhi. He said upon drying these must be burnt otherwise their seeds would not destroy. Citizens of urban and rural areas may also be inspired to help in this noble cause besides utilizing the paid labour suggested he. In villages this work can be done under MNREGA scheme. Idle labour will get work and the environment will also be cleaned from these harmful weeds./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Find a polluting BMTC bus, file a complaint to win cash","BANGALORE: Did you know that the BMTC launched an initiative nearly five years ago to help curb the pollution emitted by its fleet of buses? With the Karnataka high court coming down heavily on the Karnataka State Pollution Board (KSPB) recently for not doing enough to reduce noise and air pollution in the city, BMTC's initiative has found its place in the limelight. Now, citizens can take the task of keeping pollution levels under control in their own hands. All you have to do is note down the number and route of a bus, if you spot it spewing black smoke or if the driver honks too much. Report this to the BMTC via its website or toll-free number. If the complaint checks out, then the person stands a chance to win a cash prize of Rs 1,000./""This initiative has been around for at least 4-5 years. Now that the court has come down heavily on the pollution control board, a lot of people have been asking us what measures we are taking to curb pollution. This scheme is our answer,"" says BMTC managing director Dr Ekroop Caur. Ask her if anyone has won the cash reward and she says, ""There have been a few people who have got it. Very often, though, we find that the smoke is within permissible levels. As far as honking is concerned, our policy is to use only electric horns that do not exceed the acceptable 85 decibels."" The BMTC MD goes on to clarify that the initiative doesn't cover excessive honking by bus drivers, as there is no way to monitor that./Tell Nishant Reddy, a senior engineer at a MNC, that such an initiative has been around for years and he reacts with surprise. ""I had no clue, but I think it's a positive initiative by the BMTC. If you look at most of the buses plying on our roads, it would seem like they've never been to a service station for regular maintenance. Hopefully, Bangaloreans are responsible and will make an effort to clean up the city, one bus at a time. A reward of `1,000 makes it all the more sweet.

But this increase can be slashed to 650 megatons under the High Shift scenario, in which cities develop extensive BRT and metro systems. The latest data show China is already sharply increasing/investments in public transport./CO2 emissions in India are projected to leap from about 70 megatons today to 540 megatons by 2050, also because of growing wealth and urban populations./But this increase can be moderated to only 350 megatons, under the latest plan by addressing crucial deficiencies in India's public transport./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Clean cookstoves designed in Bangalore are transforming lives,"Nelson Vinod Moses/Giri, a hardworking 29-year-old from Andhra Pradesh, runs a paying guest accommodation in Marathahalli. Serving affordable hot breakfasts, lunches and dinners to the 80-100 residents of his PG is a daily challenge. Roti, rice, dal, and curries all need to be cooked in a short period of time. The quantities are huge; 500 chapatis roll off his kitchen daily./His biggest cost is fuel (firewood), because he can't afford commercial gas. After buying two firewood-burning clean cookstoves for between Rs 8,000 and Rs 12,000, Giri decided to sink in another Rs 35,000 for a bigger stove. The Rs 45,000 that he plonked down may sound like a lot, but it saves him between Rs 8,000 and Rs 10,000 a month, compared to using commercial gas. The stoves he uses solve the problem of traditional cookstoves that require far more firewood, emit harmful gases, don't transmit enough heat and have to be located outdoors because of the copious smoke emissions. ""Even the food tastes better,"" says Giri./The stoves that Giri uses are the product of over two decades of research, design and engineering by Svati Bhogle, CEO of Technology Informatics Design Endeavour (TIDE), and her team at SustainTech, a for-profit arm of the organisation. TIDE is a non-profit company supported by a 15-year grant of Rs 18 lakh a year from the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India./SustainTech's stoves are different from conventional mud-and-brick stoves because they are designed to consume less firewood, produce more heat, are almost smokeless and reduce harmful emissions like carbon monoxide. According to the WHO, more than 1.3 million people in India die annualy from causes linked to indoor air pollution. The excessive use of firewood also has an environmental impact./Bhogle founded SustainTech in 2011 to market commercial stoves primarily targeted at street food vendors and small businesses, like the one Giri runs. By last count, they have sold almost 3,000 stoves, mostly in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Bhogle plans to expand to Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajashtan, and is targeting selling 5,000 stoves annually within two years. Considering that the National Association of Street Food Vendors of India (NASVI) estimates that there are 1 crore street-food vendors in India, this is an almost inexhaustible market segment./Bhogle, well-known cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle's sister, has an MTech from IIT Bombay, and began her career at Hindustan Unilever Research Centre. She later became part of an ongoing project at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) to work on clean cookstoves./Designing a good cookstove is about solving two main problems: making them efficient from an engineering design standpoint, and designing them based on user needs. ""I wasn't socially sensitive when we started. We just knew we had to maximize heat efficiency, minimize loss, and reduce emissions. But we hadn't gone to the field to find out what else users wanted. We were talking down to people, being intellectually arrogant,"" recalls Svati. The group went ahead with designing what they thought was the most fuel-efficient stove. It was summarily rejected./Users wanted faster cooking and soot-free vessels, but Bhogle and her team members focused on making the most smokeless and fuel-efficient stove. Changing tracks, Bhogle learned Kannada, socialized with the women, cooked, ate, and listened to their stories. The feedback helped her understand that for faster cooking, the power level had to increase, but that meant losses would also go up. Since heat gain is defined by parameters like vessel surface area, they had to find a way to translate the need into a design concept and engineering equations. Insulation was important, because the idea was to maximize heat gain and minimize loss. The team redefined the specs of the stove and also made it easy to build using a simple mould, which anybody could use to build stoves on their own./Through various grants, they started a training program for women in Tumkur, trained 100-odd women in using the mould to build stoves using mud and bricks, and market them to other women. This evolved into an women entrepreneurship project in 2010 under the forest department, who placed orders directly with the women. The program has been exported to Orissa, West Bengal, Uttarakhand and Andhra Pradesh. Some of the women who were trained in Karnataka were instrumental in building a bigger stove using the same design in Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh, for a school mid-day meal scheme./Bhogle realized that selling household stoves was a tough market to crack as it had plenty of competitors, and they started building bigger stoves for small industries. Even though by 2009, they had sold 11,840 small business stoves, 7,000 household stoves and 200 1-5 kW hydro-power plants, which cumulatively represented wood savings of nearly 65,000 tonnes a year and a 116,000-tonne annual reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, they needed scale and a new market segment./The breakthrough came in 2008, when TIDE got the Ashden Energy Champion UK Award, which came with a \xA340,000 prize. Bhogle decided to plough the cash into setting up a for-profit social enterprise to target street-food vendors. TIDE started designing from 2009 and have released four different prototypes in 2011 under the Pyro brand-name - the tava stove, the multi-purpose stove, the tea stove and powdery biofuel stove. The stoves come in different dimensions because a one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work, as they are used for different purposes like making tea, rotis, dosas, biryani and deep-frying./Interpreting spoken and unspoken user needs is key to usable design, says Bhogle. ""If you do not understand this, you can go wrong. If a vendor says 'I want 16 kg oil heated up in 20 minutes' or wants to cook 20 kg of biryani, you need to convert that into the correct power input and output. The design should take into account the rate of fuel intake, so the opening of the fuel feeding port should be smaller or bigger depending on the need. The correct insulation is important and so is the size of the vessel,"" explains Bhogle./Understanding user needs also helps in quickly responding to demand by tweaking the design of existing products. After initially launching tava stoves that were of a 2x3 feet dimension, TIDE started getting orders for stoves that were 4x2.5 feet from vendors catering to commuters traveling on long distance buses. Their need is to serve 20-25 dosas in 15 minutes. For this, the tava needs to be at uniform temperature throughout./Compared to conventional woodstoves, the Pyro stoves burn on an average 3 kg of fuel an hour (as opposed to 5 kg) with a 40% lower fuel consumption. They cost more, but vendors and home-makers can recover the cost within 6-8 months due to lower fuel costs, says Bhogle./(The writer is an independent journalist who writes on social entrepreneurship)/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

The masks were to be given to the traffic personnel who address maximum crowd and face pollution during working hours./Each constable has to manage traffic for eight hours. At least three constables are deployed on busy roads in three-hour shifts. During their duty they are exposed to vehicles spewing gases and dust in the air./According to sources, the city traffic department procured the masks with the help of NGOs and government funds. The masks were given to traffic constable at Sultanganj ki Pulia, Sikandara crossing, Hariparwat and water-works to name a few. Even after knowing that these masks can save them from severe health problems like respiratory infections, heart disease and lung cancer, the traffic cops resisted donning them./A traffic constable at Sultanganj ki Pulia said the pollution mask that has been given to him makes him feel choked. ""Sometimes, it is difficult to breathe. They (masks) are usually not good and make us feel uncomfortable. So, you hardly see any policemen wearing these masks,"" he added./Another traffic constable said the belt of the mask is extremely tight and difficult to wear all day long. He added, ""We have to take off the mask to whistle while controlling traffic which is inconvenient.""/At the same time, the traffic cops admitted that they often suffered from respiratory and skin-related aliments but could not suggest any solution to these problems. However, they were adamant about not wearing the masks./Health experts, however, claim that traffic cops are exposed to toxic exhaust for long hours which pose a threat to their lungs in the long run. The hazards get severe when the duty hours are long. ""Traffic cops have to undergo strain in a polluted environment due to smoke emitted by vehicles, high decibel sound of horns and dust. I am treating many traffic cops who are facing health hazards due to smoke and dust,"" said Dr Sudhir Chaudhary, a lung and chest expert./He warned that constant exposure to air pollution could lead to difficulty in breathing, wheezing, coughing, asthma and aggravation of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions. These effects can result in increased medication use, increased doctor or emergency room visits, more hospital admissions and even premature death./SP, traffic, Ashok Kumar Tripathi said wearing the mask wearing is not mandatory here but the masks have been given to the cops after the government directive. The officials also claimed that traffic cops must wear these masks and if the cops have any type of inconvenience wearing them, they can report about it./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Board tested dump yard air for toxins just three times since 2011,"CHENNAI: Despite garbage frequently catching fire or being set ablaze at the Kodungaiyur and Perungudi dump yards and repeated complaints from residents of localities nearby about smoke and health problems, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) has collected air samples from the sites to test for toxins only thrice since 2011./Data obtained by TOI through an RTI application has found that the board tested air at Kodungaiyur just once, in 2011-12, when it collected six samples. It tested the air in Perungudi on two occasions, collecting four samples in 2012-13 and two in 2013-14./Of the six samples from Kodungaiyur, three contained respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) well in excess of the maximum permissible limit of 100 ug/m3 (micrograms per cubic meter of air)./In Perungudi, the board found two of the four air samples collected in 2012-13 and one of the two collected in 2013-14 had higher than permissible RSPM levels./Research has shown that exposure to air with an RSPM levels in excess of 100ug/m3 causes a wide range of health problems, including respiratory illnesses and cancer./The corporation and private sanitation company Ramky Enviro unload more than 4,500 tonnes of garbage into the Kodungaiyur and Perungudi dump yards every day and ragpickers often set fire to garbage to collect metal. But Corporation of Chennai's public health department has not conducted a single check on residents of localities surrounding the dump yards for possible problems as a result of air pollution. The residents say many families suffer from respiratory disorders./Tests by Community Environmental Management and Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives in 2012 showed that air around the Kodungaiyur yard contained at least 19 toxic chemicals and carcinogens./A TNPCB official said the board does not have the equipment to monitor air pollution. ""We plan to install ambient air quality monitors in these areas as soon as possible,"" he said./Environmentalist Nityanand Jayaraman says the Swachh Bharat campaign is a good initiative but officials remain removed from ground realities such as the fallout of dumping garbage in open sites within the city. ""People in areas near the dump yards are fed up with air and water pollution. The corporation should shut down the dump yards,"" she said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Diwali in 'D Company' grip,"KOLKATA: If you are planning to celebrate Diwali with light, not sound, beware of the 'D Company'. And the dreaded D is not the notorious terrorist and crime boss, but rather ""Duplicate"" - counterfeit fireworks that threaten to play havoc with your health./""D Company"" is the code with which numerous retailers in the city are referring to counterfeit fireworks that have flooded the market this year. For the casual buyer, they are almost impossible to distinguish from fireworks manufactured by reputable brands, since the packaging - even down to the holograms - have been done extremely well, said a police source./The most important - and crucial - differerence from branded firecrackers is that they spew a whole lot of poisonous chemicals in the air, leaving Kolkatans vulnerable to a host of serious diseases, ranging from temporary distress to even cancer, said doctors and pollution experts. And some of them can be downright dangerious to boot./""The main problem with counterfeit fireworks is that they do not conform to any emission or safety norms,"" said Somendra Mohan Ghosh of the NGO Saviour and Friends of Environment (SAFE). He, along with his colleague Sudipto Bhattacharjee of the NGO, collected samples of such fireworks to measure their noise and emission levels./""So, besides swindling customers, the fireworks will pollute the city's air. A lot of these, being packaged as noiseless fireworks, will actually create a lot of noise,"" Ghosh added./Kolkata's air, which is already polluted at the best of times, can't just bear such a huge amount of pollutants, felt Bhattacharjee. ""Everyone speaks of the high noise pollution during Diwali, but air pollution becomes the worst hit, because of the illegal fireworks. The heavy metal pollution is the worst culprit,"" he added./""It's very difficult to distinguish them from the label or hologram, but the sellers know them it all. The real picture would emerge if the law-enforcers raid the fireworks hubs in Burrabazar to collect samples and carry out the tests,"" he added./There is also a threat from fireworks of foreign origin that are being brought into Kolkata under false declarations. ""Various fireworks associations have informed us that these smuggled items include the chemical potassium chlorate, which is a hazardous chemical and can ignite or explode spontaneously,"" said a fire brigade officer. Chinese fireworks are said to be especially dangerous in this way./Inhaling fumes emitted by firecrackers not only makes one cough, go breathless and suffer from throat irritation, but it also worsens pre-existing conditions such as asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia. Children and the elderly with lung diseases are especially vulnerable, warned health experts. ""The level of air pollution during Diwali reaches almost 'poisonous' levels. As responsible citizens, we need to bring awareness about the harm we cause ourselves and our neighbours when we pollute the air by bursting firecrackers,"" said preventive healthcare expert Debasish Basu./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution on Diwali getting worse,"NEW DELHI: The festival of light seems to be the worst time for people suffering from asthma and other respiratory diseases with the city's air quality deteriorating with each passing year during Diwali. Even the Delhi government's campaign against crackers has failed to bring down the pollution levels./An analysis of levels of various pollutants on Diwali day since 2010 reveals a disturbing trend. Levels of some pollutants, including sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), seem to be on the rise./The levels of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 (particles smaller than 2.5 micrometres), which have serious health implications as these tend to get lodged in the lung and can even enter the bloodstream, have been seven to eight times higher than the standard level for several years./PM 2.5 is associated with a number of health impacts such as asthma, bronchitis, chronic respiratory symptoms including, shortness of breath and painful breathing, and premature deaths. High SO2 levels are also linked with inflammation of airways and severe breathing difficulty./Meanwhile, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Friday announced that it had formed seven teams to assist DCs and visit various areas to check noise levels on Diwali. It asked the Delhi Police to ensure that the total number of firecracker licences issued this year should not exceed the last year's figure./List of licences granted to be displayed on the official website of licensing unit of the Delhi Police, a copy of which is to be given to the DPCC./Sub-divisional magistrates have been asked to organize meetings with RWAs to sensitize them about of Supreme Court directions regarding complete ban on bursting of sound emitting firecrackers between 10pm and 6am./As far as air pollution is concerned, Anand Vihar seems to be the worst affected. PM 10 (coarse particles) levels have been 10 to 13 times higher than the standard level in 2012 and 2013,/PM 2.5 levels have been about seven to eight times the standard. Experts say heavy traffic in Anand Vihar and vehicles from Ghaziabad may be adding to the Diwali emissions. ""We have noticed that even on regular days, air pollution levels are on the higher side in Anand Vihar, Civil Lines and IGI Airport. In Anand Vihar, the interstate traffic may be causing levels to go up. As for high SO2 levels, they may be from imported crackers that seem to have high sulphur content,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of clean air programme at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)./M P George, scientist at the DPCC air lab, said Anand Vihar's high particulate matter levels could also be linked to the industries near the Delhi border./Delhi Pollution Control Committee had tested firecracker samples recently and found most of them to be flouting the Explosives Rules, 2008, as their manufacturers did not mention the chemical composition on the packages. This means that there is no monitoring of the heavy metals that are also emitted from crackers./""You will notice that a lot of colour crackers are being used now. So they are not just noisy and polluting, they may be causing toxic pollution due to presence of heavy metals. We are not even aware of what health impacts these coloured and imported crackers may be causing,"" added Roy Chowdhury./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Magical winterline makes appearance in Mussoorie,"Prachi Raturi Misra/MUSSOORIE: It's that view of the mountains that would serve as an inspiration to Nicholas Roerich. Brilliant orange meets magical mauve and there's a hint of red - the magical Mussoorie winterline has made its first appearance of the season./The winterline is a phenomenon unique to Mussoorie and parts of Switzerland, caused by the refraction of sunlight at a particular angle, and visible from mountain areas with a long, clear view of a valley towards the west. The phenomenon can be seen mid-October to January, at sunset, as the sun drops behind a false horizon creating a grey and mauve strip./The view is so rare and unique that that efforts were made last year to make the winterline a tourist draw, with the 'Winterline Carnival'./Author Bill Aitken who made Mussoorie his home years ago has just returned from a trip to Delhi, and says he cannot wait to see the winterline each evening: ""Until you go out of Mussoorie, you don't realize what you are missing everyday,"" he says./Sandeep Sahney, member of the state Tourism Development Board, also the man who conceptualized the winterline carnival, said, ""The winterline is God's unique creation and I feel privileged to have seen it through the years. It is a photographer's delight and we want to popularise it.""/The view, however, is going to be a bit hazy for a while, met department officials said./Anand Sharma, director of the meteorological department office at Dehradun, says, ""There is moisture in the air which is causing a haze. We also expect some western disturbances around Oct 24-26. Then, of course, there is the air pollution around Diwali that will dim the view.

Crackers will choke the air for three weeks,"Bangalore: Bhoomika GK, 32, a bank employee and resident of Ullal, West Bangalore, decided to skip her morning walks for the next 10 days. Her doctor-friend advised her not to venture out, especially in the morning and evening, as the air will be thick with cracker-produced pollutants during Diwali and the days to follow./According to Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) estimates, the pollutants will linger on in the air for at least three weeks./KSPCB chairman Vaman Acharya said suspended particles and remains of some heavy metals emitted due to bursting of crackers, stay in the air for several days after Diwali. Some of these are dangerous as they trigger respiratory problems, especially for those suffering from asthma. Bursting of crackers inside closed premises and congested areas are even more dangerous as the pollutants stay trapped there for long,"" he added./""According to our estimates, air pollution levels went up by 34% during last Diwali compared to normal days. Regular monitoring of pollutants during the post-festival period showed that they stayed on for three weeks. Both smoke and light-emitting crackers have harmful effects. Made of chemicals like sulphur, nitrate and heavy metals, they affect health in different ways,"" said a senior board official./Another official with KSPCB said this time round, Diwali is followed by an extended weekend which could mean bursting of more crackers. B Nagappa, scientific officer, said fine dust and ash molecules produced during the festival shoot up to 1 km in the air and gradually settle down. These deposits can harm people in the long run./""Following Supreme Court guidelines, the government framed strict norms on the level of chemicals to be used while manufacturing crackers. In a way, we have brought down uncontrolled use of chemicals. However, use of crackers can be checked only through awareness,"" he added./Light a lantern, fly it high/Not all Diwali festivities are about crackers and fumes. North Karnataka has had a tradition of flying lanterns called Akasha Buttis for years now. China, too, has a similar tradition where they release hot paper air balloons, better known as Chinese lanterns./Drawing a leaf out of these practices, residents of HSR Layout will celebrate the festival of lights by releasing 1,000-odd flying lanterns into the sky on Wednesday. Residents will assemble in a playground and release the flying lanterns into the air between 4pm and 8pm. Of course, crackers are a strict no-no./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution likely to increase 40-50%,"PUNE: If you live in Hadapsar, Shivajinagar or Alandi and suffer from asthma or some other respiratory disease, you may consider going out of town as these areas are likely to witness the highest rise in pollution levels during Diwali celebrations, stated the System Of Air Quality Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)./""According to our model, the situation will be worst in Hadapsar this Diwali where the PM 2.5 levels are likely to shoot over 100 micro grams per cubic meter and PM 10 levels will cross 200. Pollution levels at Shivajinagar and Alandi will also remain high,"" said Neha Parkhi, programme officer at SAFAR./While pollution levels at nine observation points in the city are likely to cross the permissible 100 micro grams per cubic meter for PM 10, Manjri and Nigdi on the city's outskirts are likely to have the least pollution levels, she added./""Within the city also wind directions can play an important role. For instance the level of pollutants in Lohegaon is much higher than last year while certain areas like Shivajinagar may witness a drop in certain pollutants. This is because the winds may blow the pollutants along to areas that may witness bursting of more crackers,"" explained IITM scientist Gufran Beig, the programme director of SAFAR./The bursting of firecrackers results in an increase of all pollutants, but the ones that are of the greatest concern for the city are particulate matter - particles suspended in the air. There are two indicators - PM 10 and PM 2.5 - particles less than 10 microns in size and those less than 2.5 microns in size respectively. Of these, the finer particles (PM 2.5) can penetrate through the gaseous exchange region of the lungs and enter the bloodstream and affect other organs./Beig said the highly dangerous PM 2.5 levels are likely to increase by 40-50% across the city while PM 10 levels are likely to increase by 30-40%. ""However, if there is a 20-25% reduction in bursting of firecrackers, it could result in a significant reduction in pollution levels,"" he added./Scientists at SAFAR have used their observations of emission levels from last year's Diwali and combined the data with the predictions of weather-related factors such as temperature and winds to make the forecast.

Diwali air pollution in Ghaziabad dips,"GHAZIABAD: If statistics are anything to go by, Ghaziabad is breathing somewhat easy after Diwali. The city saw a dip in air pollution levels this year compared with Diwali in the last three years, according to the state Pollution Control Board (PCB), though they continued to hover far above the acceptable threshold./A minor dip was also witnessed in the noise level, data gathered by the PCB from various locations of the city between 8am and 11pm on Thursday showed./Paras Nath, chief of the PCB in Ghaziabad, said, ""Last year, we noticed cracker sales in the city included those with noise levels exceeding 125 decibels, the maximum limit laid down by the Supreme Court. But this year, our teams that went around the market areas could not find any crackers with sound levels above 125 decibels. This is a major achievement, and shows a new maturity among cracker manufacturers.""/He felt the reduction in the pollution levels was an indication that people were becoming were sensitive to the ecology./For air pollution, the figures of suspended particulate matter (SPM) were less than the last three years - this year, it was 210 micrograms per cubic metre compared with 265 in 2013, 258 in 2012 and 265 in 2011. Similarly, the respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) was 215 this year as opposed to 235 in 2013, 232 in 2012 and 224 in 2011./The air quality monitoring on Diwali day was carried out by the PCB in collaboration with an NGO, Paryavaran Sachetak Samiti, with equipment made available by the Central Pollution Control Board./Vijaypal Baghel, an environmental activist who was the NGO's representative, said, ""The major difference this Diwali was that citizens could clearly see the stars in the sky, because the air was not so polluted with smoke from pyrotechnics.""/This was corroborated by city physician Dr NK Soni. ""You can be certain that air pollution was much lower this time than in the last many years. Doctors had far fewer cases of allergic bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections to attend to this Diwali. These are the infections and allergies that mainly affect residents after a smoke-filled Diwali,"" he said./Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr Ajay Agarwal concurred.

Smoke and chemicals make breathing difficult in Kolkata,"KOLKATA: The quality of air that had started deteriorating over the last few days nosedived to an alarming level on Friday, a day after Kali Puja. Air pollution was triggered by unchecked bursting of crackers, many of those ""banned"", said environmentalists./According to the West Bengal Pollution Control Board's (WBPCB) average air quality data, the level of PM10 %(atmospheric particulate matter) shot up to 281.73 micrograms per cubic meter (\xB5g/m\xB3), which is a few notches higher than the average reading, on Friday morning. On Tuesday night, the PM10 level recorded in city air stood at 152.25 \xB5g/m\xB3 and on Wednesday, it dropped slightly to 151.55 \xB5g/m\xB3. But on Kali Puja night (Thursday), the PM10 level jumped to 168.26 \xB5g/m\xB3./The higher the level of PM10 in air, the more it has an impact on human health and the climate. The sub-types of PM10, including the suspended particulate matter (SPM) and the respirable suspended particle (RSP), cause respiratory and other ailments, particularly among children and the elderly./Not only PM10, toxicity of air was intensified by the rise in sulphur dioxide level. On Monday, sulphur dioxide level was recorded at 15.32 \xB5g/m\xB3. It increased each day to touch 22.36\xB5g/m\xB3 on Wednesday and a very high 25.29 \xB5g/m\xB3 on Friday, post Kali Puja./According to an official of the pollution control board, it is a routine affair of pollution level increasing post Diwali, but what is alarming is the sudden rise and its intensity. It takes a long time for air pollution to climb down to normal levels since the onset of winter changes air density and that causes increase in harmful dust particles. Under the standards fixed by the Central Pollution Control Board, about 12 parameters including sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, SPM, RSP, ozone and lead need to be measured to determine air quality./Not only during Kali Puja, the quality of air in Kolkata remains a cause for concern throughout the year. Daily air quality reports reveal that levels of SPM and RSP in the city have crossed the permissible limit. Places like Park Circus, Shyambazar, Sealdah and Ultadanga have been worst-hit./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Which side of the Diwali debates are you on?,"The deliberation that goes into Diwali all boils down to whether you want to go down the new path or the traditional one/Diwali is a time of sweets, firecrackers and lights,but these very things also make it a time of discussions, dilemmas, and decisions. Following tradition, health concerns, noise pollution and scared pets are all factors that influence your Diwali. We present some of the Diwali debates that are present in every house during the festive season./CHOCOLATE OR MITHAI?/There's no question that Diwali would be incomplete without sweets. But the chocolates-vsmithai issue is something that requires a certain amount of hashing out. ""I got married recently, and this is going to be my first Diwali with my inlaws. Had I been at my parents' place, I would have insisted on gifting chocolates to everyone. People love chocolates. Also, it is easy to choose a box of chocolate over a mithai ka dabba. But I'm at my in-laws' house and I don't want them to say I'm making a lot of changes around the house. They always gift pure ghee sweets, so I'll stick to their tradition only,"" says Niharika Gupta*, a web developer./Prachi Bhutani, a city based health professional, says, ""I am a doctor, and trust me, the fat and sugar in chocolates is bad and can also give you acne. Moreover, chocolates are high in calories. I prefer making sugar-free mithais at home. For instance, you can easily make kheer without sugar. Also, khoya sweets can also be made at home, which are sugar free.""/Yet, the chocolate lovers are sticking to their guns regardless of what others may be doing. ""Whenever Diwali is around the corner, we are always discussing whether we should gift our friends mithai or chocolates. My daughter is always insistent on gifting chocolates because she says everyone likes chocolates. Plus, they come in a lot of varieties. But I feel that going to someone's house without a box of motichoor laddoos doesn't look good on Diwali. So, we buy chocolate gift packs for my daughter's friends, while sticking to the regular mithai box for our family friends,"" says Anupama Jain, a homemaker./""Last year, we got so many sweets that they lasted for a month. We distributed some to our maids because no one wanted to eat them at our place. This time, I am going to gift chocolate boxes because chocolates are something that everyone eats. And even if you don't like them, you have kids in your family or your building complex who could eat them. It is not a waste. Also, gifting chocolates would be a hint to my friends that even I'd prefer chocolates, instead of those ghee-laden sweets,"" adds Sujata Das*, a teacher./TO VISIT FAMILY OR NOT/There's also the issue of visiting each relative during the holiday or having a common get together. ""Diwali gifting is a custom in our family, and the whole idea behind it is to make sure that everyone steps out to visit their relatives. Diwali is the only time we actually go visit everyone in our family at their homes. Otherwise, you meet at a common place outside of the house. Everyone decorates their homes and it's good for them to invite others, who will then appreciate all their efforts. The gifts are just a reason to make sure this doesn't stop. One doesn't have to make it a very expensive affair because it's the gesture that counts. Even if it is for formality sake, at least people step out,""explains Anita Kalsi, who works in a government office./""I don't get the point of going to every relative's house in the limited time just to give them gifts.The traffic is out of control in the days leading to Diwali.You spend hours trying to reach someone's house and then spend just a few minutes there. Instead, our family has decided to meet in one place before Diwali, where everyone can spend time together and have a good family evening. The money that would have been spent in on the gifts can be used to divide the bill equally, and at least, we'll all have a good Diwali together,"" says Rishabh Jain, who works with a dance school./CRACKERS OR SILENT DIWALI?/While eco-friendly ways are catching on quickly in most places, a Diwali without firecrackers seems unthinkable to some. So it's natural that many people face the dilemma of having a 'real Diwali' or an environmentally friendly one./""In schools, kids are asked to make posters and take a pledge that they won't be bursting crackers during Diwali. My kids are all for a cracker-less Diwali, but the elders feel that it is inauspicious not to burn crackers on the day of the festival. So we have bought crackers like sparklers, whirlpools and flower pots which anaars that only emit light and don't create any sort of noise pollution. This way, both the elders and kids are satisfied,"" says Mitali Kumar, a homemaker./""Many people say that crackers create air pollution. But I like bursting crackers. After all, it is just once a year, and within limits. Bursting a few crackers won't harm anyone. The pollution won't disappear if only I don't burst crackers. After all, there are crackers which create less pollution. Why not use them instead of not using crackers at all?"" asks Shivam Anand, a senior accounts manager./""When everyone will be boasting about the money spent on crackers, I don't want to look out of place saying that I'm having a silent Diwali. I'm anyway not harming anyone's pet or stray dogs. Why shouldn't I burst crackers then?"" asks Sushant Singh*, a school student./However, some people are ready to ditch the firecracker-filled Diwali for a noiseless one. ""I recently got a pet dog, Dobby, and for the last few days, he has been quite discomfited because of the loud noise of crackers. I have never been in favour of bursting crackers, but this year, even my younger brother, who loves loud crackers, has decided to go for a cracker-less Diwali. We can't ask others to not celebrate Diwali the way they want to, but at least we can opt for a festival sans crackers,"" shares Nisha Nagpal, a University student./""Our health minister is advocating a silent Diwali, but his own party members celebrated the victory of the BJP in Maharashtra and Haryana with crackers. Isn't that hypocritical? Asking us to remain silent on Diwali while they burst crackers even when it's not Diwali? I advocate a silent Diwali because I have a small kid who gets scared and starts crying whenever he hears the crackers. We celebrate Diwali with just sparklers and lamp,"" says Rishabh Kumar, an HR manager./Nidhi Gupta, a city based resident, adds, ""It was because of my son's school that we stopped bursting crackers. My son told us four years ago told us that he doesn't want to burst crackers anymore because the noise scares the animals and creates pollution. Now our 'cracker time' is replaced with more family time on Diwali.""/DIYAS OR LIGHTS?/Diwali is a festival of lights, but the choice of lights has become a subject of debate in recent times. ""I always go for diyas over lights because they look prettier. Lights look artificial. When you get a day to save your electricity, why won't you? It's the only time when you can light your house with diyas. I love putting them at every corner of my house and inside the rooms. I then switch off the lights to see how beautiful it is looking,"" explains Sushant Agrawal, a lawyer./Nishi Sharma Malhotra, a city based professional, says, ""I've been using diyas instead of fairy lights, but my reason isn't just saving the environment. The need of the hour is helping our economy in any way we can. Instead of buyi ng lights made in China, I would rather go for diyas made in India. The aim is to buy things made locally, so you keep your money in your country. Diyas might be more cost ly than fairy lights, but they take up a lot of electricity and you end up spending that much anyway."" Shefali Goyal, is another city based resident who roots for diyas, ""I prefer diyas over fairy lights any day because of the nostalgia attached to it./When I was growing up, diyas and candles were the only things used for decorations and the house used to look so beautiful. Then came the trend of colourful Chinese lights, which I feel don't look good at all. My house looks beautiful with a simple row of diyas.""/""We prefer lights. With lamps and candles, you have to be alert all the time. Also, you have to be careful about lamps going off with a string wind. And you have to light a lamp or a candle every hour or two, depending on how much oil there is or how thick your can f dle is. But once you switch on the lights, you don't have to worry . We keep candles as our backup plan if there is a power cut on that day . The electric lights free you from doing unnecessary work,"" says Manish Shukla, an assistant engineer./""The Chinese fairy lights are beautiful, affordable and pollution-free. In the city, apartments are closed and traditional lamps create smoke. The oil these days is mostly adulterated, which results in too much smoke, so there's always a chance of the fire alarm going off. The only solution is a A pure ghee lamp, but you can't decorate your entire house with them. I keep the pure ghee lamps for my puja thali, but that's about it. I use fairy lights for decorating my house as they don't use too much electricity,"" says Aditi Saai Raam, a city based homemaker./Pragya Pandey adds, ""Lamps just burn for a few hours. If you go out somewhere, when you come back, they are out. I really hate seeing a dull house on Diwali, so I make decorative lights using zero watt bulbs. The antiChina products drive is really taking steam, so we're making our own lights.""/(*Names changed on request)/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
A word of caution for walkers post-Diwali,"INDORE: Mahima Singh, 27, an IT professional and resident of Saket Nagar has decided to skip her morning walk for the next 10 days. Her doctor-friend advised her not to venture out, especially in the morning and evening hours, as the air will be thick with cracker-produced pollutants./According to Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) the pollutants will be present in the air for at least two to three weeks. ""Statistics of last three years released by MPPCB after Diwali indicates that Respiratory Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) level goes up to 450 to 500 microgram/cubic metre post Diwali as against the permissible limit of 100 microgram/cubic metre./Chief chemist of MPPCB Aparna Bapat said the suspended particles and residue of some heavy metals emitted due to bursting of crackers, stay in the air for several days after the festival. ""Some of these are dangerous as they trigger respiratory problems, more so for those suffering from asthma. Bursting crackers inside closed premises and congested areas are even more dangerous as the pollutants stay trapped inside for long"", she added./According to the estimate, air pollution levels go up dangerously high post-Diwali as compared to normal days. Regular monitoring of pollutants during the post-festival period showed that they remained for two-three weeks. Both smoke and light-emitting crackers have harmful effects. Made of chemicals like sulphur, nitrate and heavy metals, they affect health adversely in many ways"", said a senior board official requesting anonymity./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Delhi's air very unhealthy: US embassy monitor,"NEW DELHI: Delhi's air has again made headlines for the wrong reasons. The US embassy's pollution monitor at Chanakyapuri on Wednesday measured air quality at 'very unhealthy' levels, prompting a post in an international news portal warning against letting children outdoors for prolonged periods in the capital./The embassy's website calculated the air quality index (AQI) at 248 at 8am and 260 at 6pm. The index is a measure of air quality on a progressively deteriorating scale of 0 to 500, based on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air./According to US standards, readings in the 201-300 range are termed 'very unhealthy', which could lead to ""significant aggravation of heart or lung disease and... significant increase in respiratory effects"". The advisory for this level asks people with heart or lung disease, older adults and children to ""avoid all physical activity outdoors""./The embassy releases hourly AQI figures. Wednesday's levels suddenly made news when a blog in the Wall Street Journal website quoted the figures. Ironically, it came on a day when air pollution in the city was at its lowest since Diwali and lower than the corresponding period last year./Met department and earth sciences ministry air monitors showed only a slight different AQI level on Wednesday - an average of 220 for the day - but pegged the air quality level as 'poor'. That's because the ministry has a more relaxed categorization./A thick blanket of smoke is seen over the Red Fort in New Delhi./The air quality had worsened to 'severe' right after Diwali, according to monitoring by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) under the earth sciences ministry. Air quality is expected to again worsen by November 2, when dropping temperatures could trap polluted air over the capital./Said Gufran Beig, chief project scientist at SAFAR, ""This time, Diwali pollution was lower than last year and PM 2.5 levels were the lowest on Wednesday. On October 24, PM 2.5 concentration was 270 microgram per cubic metre while on Wednesday it was 142.""/Nevertheless, the PM2.5 levels have been a good three to four times than the Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and several times the World Health Organisation standard of 25 microgram per cubic metre, exposing people to unhealthy air./While SAFAR already has an AQI system, the Central Pollution Control Board and Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change recently launched a national AQI that's yet to be rolled out. CPCB has set a period of 45 days to get feedback and comments. There are, however, concerns about the reliability of CPCB's equipment, said a former board official who declined to be quoted./Interestingly, the US embassy's air quality monitor in Beijing - a city Delhi is often compared with for bad air quality - showed a slightly higher AQI level of 265 at midnight (Wednesday-Thursday)./The US embassy's air quality monitor has been a source of much political heartburn in China. Prominently displayed, the monitor has attracted criticism from the Chinese government, as well as relentlessly kept the attention of Beijingers on the quality of air they were breathing./Unlike in India where the US Embassy is quick to point out that the Indian government too conducts its own real-time air quality monitoring, in China, where the government did not get into the business of informing its citizens, the US Embassy's action was viewed as a direct political challenge./Also, unlike in India, where the US embassy's monitor is situated in Chanakyapuri, in Beijing, the US Embassy has positioned air quality monitors in several parts of that huge city./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Haze in Delhi due to agri-waste burning,"New Delhi: The current haze-like condition in Delhi could be linked to agricultural waste being burnt up north in Punjab and Haryana. Images released by the United States' National Aeronautics and Space Administration from its moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS)'s aqua-satellite suggest a thick blanket of aerosols lying over northern Indian states including Delhi./Delhi Pollution Control Committee officials as well as scientists at System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) under the ministry of earth sciences said that such burning of agricultural waste may be adding to Delhi's local pollution load./The images taken on October 30 and October 19 show a large area covered with red dots which suggest fire. Similar images were released in 2012 by NASA which also showed a thick layer of aerosols and fire spots. While DPCC has linked it to high air pollution levels in Delhi, several experts said it was not true as the wind direction was not towards the capital. They criticized the state pollution watchdog for not facing up to local emission sources and not acting to cut them./""This is very similar to what happened in 2012. Every year around October and early November, farmers harvest the kharif crop and sow the rabi crop. Many resort to burning the straw and other waste. We need to know whether the wind is blowing towards Delhi. We have been recommending for long now that we take the air shed approach. Pollution doesn't have boundaries. All states need to act together,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of Centre for Science and Environment's Clean Air programme./Prompted by high air pollution in Delhi and Noida, some Noida-based environmental activists even filed a petition in National Green Tribunal last year against straw and waste burning in agricultural fields./Gufran Beig, chief project scientist at SAFAR which is a joint programme with Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), said the effect of cyclone Nilofer that will hit Gujarat coast on Saturday was weak but it has changed the wind pattern. ""The wind blowing towards Delhi is from north-northwest. They are carrying a lot of moisture. They are passing near the zone where biomass waste is being burnt. It's likely to increase air pollution levels in Delhi in coming days,"" he said./The levels of PM10 (coarse, large particles) will be higher than PM2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) due to this change in wind pattern. The PM2.5 level on Friday was 141 micrograms per cubic metre, about twice the standard, and PM10 was about 241 micrograms per cubic metre, again twice the standard. PM2.5 levels are likely to go up to 181 micrograms per cubic metre by November 3./""On October 2, the environment secretary also issued directions to all state chief secretaries to avoid such biomass burning. The humidity in the air is pulling these aerosols down,"" an official from DPCC said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Cyclone to hit Delhi air quality,"NEW DELHI: The air quality in Delhi is likely to worsen from November 2 due to cyclone Nilofar which is likely to hit the Gujarat coast on Saturday./According to pollution models by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) under the ministry of earth sciences (MoES), the PM2.5 (fine, respirable particles) concentration was about 137 micrograms per cubic metre which is likely to go up to 181 micrograms per cubic metre on November 3 and will be in the ""poor"" category as per SAFAR's air quality index (AQI)./The air pollution levels will go up because the temperature in Delhi is likely to fall from November 2 due to the wind pattern during Nilofar. ""When the temperature will come down, the boundary layer (lowest part of atmosphere) that will trap the pollutants,"" said Beig. The reason for haze-like condition on Wednesday and Thursday is ""there was very little rainfall in Delhi on Tuesday which did not wash away the pollution completely. It actually brought down the aerosols which are bigger particles that got embedded due to high humidity,"" Beig added. SAFAR has also done a quick analysis of US embassy's warning on Tuesday of ""very unhealthy"" levels. ""The PM 2.5 levels were comparatively higher at Chanakyapuri on Wednesday for a short while according to our data. But we shouldn't go by hourly averages. We should always consider 24 hour averages to arrive at an AQI,"" Beig explained./Meanwhile, the IGI airport Met office noted the first ""moderate"" smog levels of the season on Thursday, which persisted the entire day. Visibility was only around 1,000 metres according to officials. ""On Diwali night, a temporary smog layer was observed at lower levels at airport and visibility reached up to 350 to 400 metres for two to three hours and then it cleared out,"" said R K Jenamani, Director, IGI Met. ""The main cause of Thursday's prolonged smog has been low wind speed and increasing moisture levels,"" he added./The ever worst smog event between 1989 and 2014 has been from October 28, 2012, to November 8, 2012, when Delhi experienced thick smog due to a cyclone that crossed the southeast coast near Karaikal in Puducherry on October 31, 2012, according to a statement by IGI Met./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
CSE organizes workshop on clean air and transport,"PUNE: Centre for Science and Environment is organizing a three-day training programme starting on November 10. The programme aims to deepen the understanding of pollution challenge due to urbanization; air quality monitoring, management and governance; clean and safe vehicle technology and fuels; in-use vehicle emissions challenge and vehicle inspection; mobility management strategies and urban design interventions to scale up public transport, multi-modal integration, walking and cycling, parking policy as a travel demand management measure etc to meet the combined objectives of public health, energy security, mobility management and climate risk mitigation./It is open for students from environmental sciences, engineering, planning, urban design, architecture backgrounds, researchers, academicians, professionals, consultants and NGOs./Air pollution is the fifth largest killer and seventh biggest illness burden in India as estimated by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) report. The speed at which urban air pollution is growing across our cities is alarming. Severe particulate pollution and newer pollutants like nitrogen oxides, ozone and air toxics are worsening the public health challenge. Vehicles are a special challenge as these are the fastest growing sources of air pollution. Vehicles emit close to our breathing zone and contribute significantly to human exposure. Rapid urbanisation, motorisation and sprawls is making our cities victims of killer pollution; congestion; oil guzzling and an obsessively car dependent infrastructure that threaten to destroy quality of life./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Neeri mobile van for pollution check,"NAGPUR: To create awareness in public and industries which contribute to air pollution, city-based National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) has come up with a mobile van which will carry the state-of-the-art equipment to monitor the levels of gases released from industries and vehicles./This van 'Emission Monitoring Vehicle and Control Lab' (EMVCL) can also help reduce the pollution levels by scrubbing the stags or chimneys of industries which release toxic gases. The vehicle is also equipped to suck in the harmful gases released from vehicles at road intersections and junctions where vehicles, while waiting for the green signal, keep releasing a lot of poisonous gases./Neeri director Satish Wate told TOI that the van would help those industries which are volunteering to monitor their actual pollution levels and adopt corrective measures. Second it will be used to monitor the level of toxic fumes released by vehicles at places like traffic signals and also demonstrate how the smoke coming out could be sucked in at these junctions by using the equipment installed./Air Pollution Control (APC) head and Neeri scientist involved in the project, Padma Rao said she basically aimed at creating awareness about their responsibility to industries and vehicle manufacturers who were the biggest polluters. ""The basic principle of 'polluter pays' should actually be followed by every individual or industry. Hence we would be sharing the data generated from our studies with vehicle manufacturers so that they can take up the responsibility of minimizing pollution in the interest of everyone by taking up projects in that direction. They can actually create green shields or set up suction units around areas where the pollution levels are high as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR),"" she said./To begin with, Neeri took up a project of finding out the different types of pollutants and their actual levels at Bhandewadi, the municipal waste disposal site in the city. ""We had expected many harmful gases here, but were really astonished to find many other unexpected pollutants. The gases released here include methane, nitrous oxide, nitrogen mono-oxide, sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, formalin, acetylene, Vinyl acetate, formic acid, toluene, metaxylene etc/Neeri plans to first study the pollution caused from lime kilns (at Wani) and stone crushers in and around the district. Then it plans to share the information with Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and involve it in giving Neeri assessment projects and gradually move on to industries which volunteer first to curb their pollution problems like rolling mills, sponge iron plants, plywood manufacturers etc./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Paddy fires in states feed smog in Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Smog intensified in the city as wind speeds reduced on Friday, leading to an accumulation of pollutants and aerosols. A Nasa satellite image showed agricultural fires in Punjab and Haryana were contributing to pollution in the region in a big way./According to IGI's Met office, a 20-25kmph wind on Thursday had helped clear the pollution over the city, leading to a good visibility of 4,000 metres. The wind calmed on Friday morning and visibility dropped to about 1100 metres in most parts of the city./According to R K Jenamani, director of IGI Met, smog may intensify further in the next 48 hours as weather models forecast calm winds in the coming days. A western disturbance (WD), currently moving across Jammu & Kashmir, may bring fresh moisture and help in intensifying the smog./Images released by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) from its Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)'s aqua satellite also shows low visibility and smog forming a channel from north-northwest region, fed by smoke coming from Punjab and Haryana where farmers are currently burning leftover stubbles from the paddy crop./Expectedly, air pollution levels are also up. PM 2.5 (fine, respirable particles) was 189 micrograms per cubic metre on Friday, three times more than the safe level of 60. PM 10 (coarse pollution particles) was about 320 microgram per cubic metre as against a safe level of 100 microgram per cubic metre. According to Gufran Beig, chief project scientist, ""pollution levels may move to very poor category on Saturday from the poor category now as per the air quality index (AQI).

Smog scare: Patients told to stay indoors,"NEW DELHI: Air quality in the city is deteriorating every day as agricultural waste burning continues unabated in Punjab and Haryana. Doctors, too, are seeing a jump in cases of acute bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and asthma. They are advising those who are vulnerable or already suffering from respiratory disorders to avoid going out during peak traffic hours, keeping inhalers handy and, if smog is severe, recommending a few weeks stay outside Delhi./The PM2.5 (fine respirable particles) levels have increased from 180 microgram per cubic metre on November 4 to about 205 microgram per cubic metre on November 9, about 3.5 times the safe standard of 60 microgram per cubic metre according to data with System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) under Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM). PM10 (coarse particles) increased from 289 microgram per cubic metre to 315 microgram per cubic metre/on Sunday. At 6.45pm, the PM2.5 level at Mandir Marg was 303 microgram per cubic metre, five times the standard and at RK Puram it was 343 microgram per cubic metre, almost six times the standard./According to IGI airport's met department, smog formed and reduced visibility on November 8 midnight to late morning of November 9. For about eight hours, the visibility remained at 400 to 500 metres. More smog is expected in the next few days. Due to western disturbances (WD) the wind speed had increased slightly, to about 15 kmph in some areas. But the WD has now moved away and the winds are calm now. ""The smog has suddenly increased with longer low visibility periods for the first time this season. In view of smog favouring circulation pattern now likely to continue for another 3-4 days the airport will be affected,"" said a statement issued by IGI Met./Meanwhile, doctors are seeing a sudden jump in complaints of acute respiratory conditions and associated complications. Dr Randeep Guleria, professor and head of pulmonary medicine at AIIMS, said, ""Due to the PM2.5 level being very high, there is a 10-15% increase in complaints of asthma and COPD.

Report warns of spiralling air pollution; outlines roadmap to curb emissions,"KOLKATA : If current trends of vehicle population, fuel and emission standards persist, PM 2.5 emissions will increase by a factor of three, and those of NOx will increase by a factor of five, warns a new report by The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri), University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The transport sector contributes about 15-50% of PM 2.5 emissions in cities, and is a dominant contributor to NOx emissions./The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that of the 67 risk factors studied in their Global Burden of Disease project, outdoor air pollution was ranked fifth in mortality and seventh in health burden in India, contributing to over 627,000 deaths and 17.7 million healthy years of life lost in 2010./The new report titled 'Options to reduce road transport pollution in India' establishes the scientific basis for reducing emissions, the technologies available, and governance issues that need to be urgently addressed to improve air quality in Indian cities./""We should go beyond technological transfers and evolve pathways for pollution control as there are co-benefits of reducing greenhouse gases and reducing the health burden. We need to develop frameworks to mobilize resources and invest in technological innovations. This report will provide intellectual inputs to formulate specific pollution control models for states, and this will require the intervention of not just the government, but all stakeholders,"" said Teri director general R K Pachauri./In 1991, there were 20 million vehicles in India. The number had skyrocketed to 140 million in 2011, and by 2030, vehicle population is expected to reach 400 million. ""We need multiple strategies to bring regulatory agencies and the regulated communities together and provide incentives to reduce the pollution load,"" felt CARB chairman Mary Nichols./Vehicular emissions contribute to particulate matter (PM) smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM 2.5) and to Nitrogen oxides, NO and NO2 (NOx). NOx in turn leads to the production of ozone. PM2.5 is the dominant contributor to premature deaths and numerous other illnesses, followed by ozone and NOx, and these are the major contributors to agricultural impacts, says the report./According to V Ramanathan, distinguished professor of Atmospheric and Climate Sciences, USCD: ""Tacklingair pollution may seem a complex problem, but California has demonstrated how drastic reductions in air pollution can be achieved. We simply cannot ignore the linkages and the multi-dimensional impacts of air pollution - for instance, ozone pollution leads to massive crop losses.""/Without affecting its economic growth, California has cut down its emissions drastically. In the 1960s, California had one of the highest air pollution levels in the world and this triggered a public health outrage. Over the past 40-50 years, California has succeeded in reducing the levels of all air pollutions by 75-90% though a series of measures. In particular, it has significantly reduced black carbon and particulate pollutants from vehicles./On the other hand, 80% cities in India which have comparatively much fewer vehicles have exceeded the ambient air quality standards prescribed by the Centre. And this is worsening air quality and leading to a plethora of health problems. There is mounting evidence now to show that the transport sector is largely responsible for the increase in the concentrations of particulate pollutants./In an attempt to replicate the best practices, UCSD, CARB and Teri launched a programme - India California Air Pollution Mitigation Programme (ICAMP) - in 2013, to learn from air pollution control measures implemented in California to mitigate vehicular emissions and improve air quality in Indian cities. Based on research and dialogues between Indian and Californian experts, the project partners have now come up with this new report./The report makes 12 specific recommendations for immediate action:/Building and monitoring information;/Upgrading fuel quality;/Tightening vehicle emission standards;/Upgrading in-use testing (inspection and enforcement);/Fostering new engine management technology;/Encouraging fleet modernization;/Shifting transportation to other modes;/Promoting non-motorized means of transport (walking and cycling);/Increasing distribution of electric and hybrid vehicles;/Using microgrids for electric and hybrid vehicles;/Improving integrated land-use planning; and,/Increasing cooperation between the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the Union and State Governments in India./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Breathe free in Nagpur, but shut your ears","NAGPUR: After being named the second greenest, orange and zero mile city, Nagpur can now also proudly claim to be a city free of air pollution, if the city's Environmental Status Report (ESR) prepared by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is to be believed. The ambient air quality monitoring for 2013-14 fiscal has recorded air pollutants within limits prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board. However, noise levels recorded exceed the standards throughout the city./Though delayed by over four months, Vidarbha Enviro Protection Limited submitted ESR to NMC a few days ago. The ESR will be tabled before the general body for approval and then submitted to the state government. The report is mandatory every year according to government policy and helps the civic body, and also the government, to plan and initiate various projects and measures to curb various pollutants./The National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme was adopted as a basis to determine the impact assessment on air environment. Air quality was checked at 25 locations, including 10 residential, 12 commercial and three industrial areas. Air pollutants parameters like particulate matter (PM10 and 2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO), representing the basic air pollutants, were identified for air quality monitoring in summer season (May-June 2014)./Despite rapid growth in number of vehicles and industries, the level of air pollutants in and around the city's residential, commercial and industrial zones is within the prescribed limits. However, in some places especially in the industrial and commercial zones, the concentration levels of PM10 and PM2.5 are alarming./""The rapid growth of number of vehicles and of commercial and industrial enterprises is generating enormous air pollutants. The concentration level of Volatile Organic Concentrations in the square and petrol pump areas is found to be more. These concentration levels are mostly due to vehicular traffic using adulterated fuel and construction activities in several areas,"" the report said./The report added that the study revealed noise levels exceeding permissible limits in all zones. It said that increasing noise levels are due to vehicular traffic and unmanaged parking in several areas. It may cause hearing impairment, hypertension, heart disease, annoyance and sleep disturbance. The conjunction and increase in vehicle population according to the population of the city are the reasons for increasing noise levels in all sections of the area./The citizens are also not much aware of the impact of noise pollution and hence blows horns, thus contributing to increased noise levels, especially in sensitive zones such as hospitals, educational institutes etc, notes the report./NMC is expected to chalk out a plan to reduce noise levels in the coming days./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

According to data released by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, which conducts regular air quality checks in Indian metros, Chennai ranks second in air pollution after Delhi./With World Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) day being observed on November 19, chest physicians in the city have called for efforts to control pollution on a war footing. COPD is a condition that arises due to obstruction of air flow in the lungs. Patients suffer from symptoms like chronic cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and limitation of activity in the later stages./""Recent studies show that many people, especially youngsters, are taking steps to quit smoking. So, while smoking may be a major cause of COPD, pollution is the culprit behind the rise in cases,"" said pulmonologist Dr G S Vijayachandar from the Institute of Thoracic Medicine in Chetpet. The institute has recorded more than 4,000 cases of respiratory illnesses in the past one year, one-third of which are COPD cases. ""We see 250 cases everyday and most of them are asthma and COPD cases. The numbers have certainly gone up,"" said the doctor, adding that there has been a 10% increase in COPD cases compared to last year./Dr Mohan Kameshwaran of Madras ENT Research Foundation said that 90% of the patients who approached the pulmonology clinic at the hospital suffered from dust allergy. The clinic recorded 625 cases of COPD last year and the numbers went up to 775 till November this year. ""Earlier only adults had such problems, but now pediatric allergies are also on the rise and it comprises 30% of cases. Patients come with wheezing, nasal bleeding and inflammation where there is a block in the airway, all being results of inhaling soot and carbon particles emitted from vehicles,"" he said./The pollution control board has set the permissible limit for respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) at 100 microgram/cubic metre. In 2013 the annual average quantity of particulate matter recorded at Anna Nagar, T Nagar and Kilpauk were way above the standard of 100 microgram per cubic meter. ""The main reasons for the presence of suspended particulate matter in the air at least in the city limits are due to the vehicular traffic, dust and sand on the roads and ongoing construction activities,"" said K Ranganathan, Director (Labs), Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board./Respiratory physician Dr P K Thomas warned that COPD is an insidious disease that shows no symptoms until it is too late. ""Nearly 50% of clinically significant COPD cases go undiagnosed. When they suffer from breathlessness, people should not ignore it as a normal part of getting older. They should approach a doctor,"" he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
COPD is similar to asthma but much more lethal:experts,"KANPUR: High levels of air pollution has given way to rise in the number of people suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which is a life-threatening lung disease. Experts suggest that pollution combined with an unbalanced lifestyle and growing smoking habits among the denizens is a major cause of rising COPD cases./According to data collected from Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), the amount of particulate matter of size 10 micrometres (PM10) observed in the air on November 5 was 240 microgram per cubic metre against the standard limit of 100 microgram per cubic metre. This clearly shows the deteriorating condition of the air quality in the city./Talking on World COPD Day, Dr Anand Kumar, director, Murari Lal Chest Hospital, LLR, said that earlier the disease was confined to adults of age 40 and above but with the change in dietary and lifestyle habits COPD has become common even in youngsters in their early 30s./""The actual cause of the disease is not known, but the precipitating factors are smoking and air pollution. The number of patients increases during winters. About 50%-60% patients we deal in OPD daily are COPD sufferers, which is an alarming situation in the city,"" he said./COPD is a life-threatening lung disease that interferes with normal breathing and is not fully reversible. The more familiar terms of chronic bronchitis and emphysema are now included within COPD diagnosis./According to experts, COPD is similar to asthma but much more lethal. ""COPD is characterised by prolonged cough with excess sputum production and breathlessness./Initially, breathlessness is observed after a light workout but gradually it may occur even when sitting idle. However, breathlessness caused due to asthma can be completely cured after proper medication,"" he said./Meanwhile, Dr SK Katiyar, former principal of GSVM medical college said that COPD, if not treated properly, gives rise to osteoporosis, anemia and cardio complications. He said that measures like quitting smoking, use of pollution-free means of cooking specifically in rural area and proper ventilation in houses might lower the risk of COPD significantly. Taking diet rich in protein and less of carbohydrates can also help keep the disease at bay./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Waste-burning thickens smog cover over NH-24,"GHAZIABAD: Haze is not uncommon in this city, particularly in winter./But, this year's smog is worsened by the burning of industrial and bio-degradable wastes from fields, which environmentalists say have been causing large-scale air pollution./In fact, smog has affected the visibility on NH-24 also. At times, the green activists claim that wastes burn for hours on end, thereby generating large quantities of smoke, which combined with fog makes for smog, posing a great risk to commuters on the highway./The activists blame the city's civic agencies and the state pollution control board for ignoring the problem./""The burning of straw and agricultural waste is what aggravates the problem. Ideally the wastes should be disposed of in a scientific manner, which is not being done. And, the civic authorities turn a blind eye to it,"" said environmental activist Vikrant Tongad./He added, ""Disposal of municipal solid waste and industrial solid waste by burning is rampant in the city. Even electronic waste like computer keyboards and defunct mobiles is also contributing to smoke and air pollution. The pollution board is also silent on this.""/When this correspondent visited Kavinagar Industrial Area, he found a fire raging in front of a factory.

"Delhi choking on foul air, time to clean up","Your early morning routine of a walk and workout out doors this winter is likely to endanger your health rather than give you any benefits. What you may believe to be fresh morning air is anything but that. There are fine pollutants hanging in the air that get into your lungs, gradually reducing its capacity.And for those who already have a respiratory condition, any strenuous exercise or exposure outdoors is a clear invitation for trouble. Doctors say they should remain indoors during early morning hours to avoid their condition getting aggravated./According to traditional wisdom, morning air is the purest. In fact, pollutants such as ground-level ozone (O3) are at their lowest level in the morning and peak only later in the day. Ozone, which is also associated with compromised lung function, may impact people towards afternoon./But in Delhi, PM 2.5 levels seem to be peaking in the morning, especially betwe ing, especially between 6 am and 10 am. Scientists attribute this to low temperatures and calm conditions that lower the boundary layer (lowest part of atmosphere), trapping particulate pollution near the surface.The same phenomenon reduces visibility and the city appears to be in a haze./""We are seeing a trend of high particulate pollution from 7 pm to 7 am, sometimes even till 10 am. This is not just because of high emissions but because as it gets colder, pollutants are trapped. It starts getting better once the sun is out and it's relatively warmer,"" says Gufran Beig, chief scientist at SAFAR, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), which monitors air quality at ten air monitoring stations in NCR, including Noida./Delhi Pollution Control Committee's (DPCC) real-time monitoring at six other stations in Delhi reflects the same trend with PM 2.5 hovering around 150 to 200 micrograms per cubic metre, two to three times the national safe standard of 60. India doesn't maintain a national air quality index (AQI) yet but the ministry of environment and forests has launched an AQI that will be operational in a few months. According to the AQI, PM 2.5 levels ranging from 121 to 250 make the air ""very poor"" and this ""may cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. The effect may be more pronounced in people with lung and heart diseases.""/Experts at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) believe that trucks plying inside the city could be causing an increase in PM levels at night. ""I think there are two things happening. Trucks are emitting at night which is leaving even early mornings polluted. The second reason is that nights are very cold which brings down the boundary layer. But our analysis too shows three peaks in air pollution levels - late night, early morning and evening. There is a slight dip in the afternoon usually,"" says Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of CSE's clean air programme. A DPCC official, who didn't wish to be quoted, said: ""The condition is quite bad in Delhi, especially in the mornings. I would suggest people speak to their physicians and follow their advice."" In Chinese cities where pollution levels are comparable with Delhi, people working outdoors have started using N 95 masks that reportedly filters almost 90% of fine pollution particles./Doctors meanwhile are seeing a steep jump in hospital admissions of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and acute bronchitis.""People who have any respiratory illness should avoid stepping out early mornings for two reasons-it's cold and it's polluted.We always advise them to go out when its sunny. Every year, we see a 20% to 25% increase in complications associated with respiratory disorders during this time,"" said Dr Arup Basu, senior consultant, chest medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital./RISK OF BEING AN EARLY BIRD/If you are stepping out early in the morning to catch that fresh air while on a walk, think again. The air quality in the city is very poor, particularly between 5.30am and 10am.The tiny PM 2.5 particles which infiltrate your lungs do the maximum damage. Noon or afternoon, when it's sunny and clear, may be a better idea./The System of Air Quality, Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), also monitors pollution in the city. This was how the graph of hourly averages looked on November 20, 2014 (the latest available)/The culprit/PM 2.5 refers to tiny particles or droplets in the air that are two-and-a-half microns or less in width. There are about 25,000 microns in an inch. When outdoor levels of PM 2.5 are elevated, staying indoors may reduce your exposure although some outdoor particles will come indoors. Some ways to reduce exposure are to limit indoor and outdoor activities that produce fine particles (for example, burning candles indoors or open burning outdoors) and avoiding strenuous activity in areas where fine particle levels are high -New York state department of health/Health impact/Numerous scientific studies have linked particle pollution exposure to a variety of problems, including premature death in people with heart or lung disease, non fatal heart attacks, irregular heartbeat, aggravated asthma, decreased lung function and increased respiratory symptoms, such as irritation of the airways, coughing or difficulty in breathing.

Burning of leaves: Agencies pass buck,"NEW DELHI: Dry leaves, which are a precious resource for making compost, are more often being burnt in the city. Smoke from such biomass burning is adding to Delhi's severe smog crisis and very high particulate pollution but agencies seem to be oblivious to this threat. Despite a ban on burning biomass waste, no FIR has been registered against the offence by any civic agency since the ban was imposed in July 1998. Delhi government's departments are busy passing the buck, claiming that none of them has the manpower or competence to crack down on offenders. But with National Green Tribunal ordering action against such burning on Wednesday, the agencies may be roused from their stupor./Every evening, small bonfires of dry leaves are a common sight in the heart of the city. People are often seen soaking in the warmth, not realizing how this will impact the already poor air quality in the city./Bhure Lal, head of Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), a body constituted by the union government to monitor environmental issues in Delhi, says burning of dry leaves is very common in Lutyens' Delhi. ""It's supposed to be cleanest area of the city but I have seen so many instances here, especially in front of the Iraq embassy. This cannot be resolved until government agencies take action. There are nodal officers from New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) who are to be contacted when there is such burning,"" he adds./According to DPCC's/legal team, biomass waste burning is banned under the environment protection act and has provisions for up to five years of imprisonment and a Rs 1 lakh fine./Civic agencies claim they can't do much as they don't have the power to take action on private property. Also, identifying the person responsible for it is difficult, say municipal officials. Though a law is in place, there is confusion over its implementation. The civic agencies claim that action has to be taken by DPCC, but the latter says it doesn't have the manpower to carry out routine checks and that the responsibility has now been given to Delhi Parks and Gardens Society (DPGS)./""We don't have the power to take action against private properties or people. We can only complaint to DPCC. We can take action against our own staff if they are caught burning leaves,'' says Yogender Chandolia, mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation. DPGS, on the other hand, claims that its role is limited to creating awareness and that it doesn't have the manpower to keep a watch on such activities./NDMC too claims helplessness in taking action. ""There is a provision to file an FIR against a person for burning dry leaves as it adds to air pollution. But most of the time, we don't know who the culprit is,'' said an official in NDMC's horticulture department./NDMC is, however, planning projects for effective utilization of green waste. It has set up four green waste management plants at Lodhi Road, Nehru Park, Talkatora and Sunder Nursery. Each plant can process two tonnes of green waste and convert it into pellets which can be used as bio-fuel. ""We are planning to set up 13 more such plants so that we can process the entire waste within our area. At present, the green waste collected from streets and markets is sent to the composting site at Okhla,'' reveals a senior NDMC official./An emissions inventory prepared by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), under the ministry of earth sciences, shows burning of biomass within 50km of Delhi increases emissions by at least 15%. In the city's surroundings, even tyres, plastics and tubes are burnt and these release cancer-causing chemicals like dioxin. ""Burning dry leaves mainly releases PM10 (coarse pollution particles) and carbon monoxide, but burning tyres releases dioxin, black carbon and PM 2.5 (fine respirable particles),"" said Gufran Beig, chief scientist at SAFAR./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Pollution checking drive in Bhagalpur, 25 vehicles seized","BHAGALPUR: With a view to checking air-pollution vis-\xE0-vis vehicle emission, the district transport office (DTO) has launched a 'Go green campaign' in Bhagalpur district. The transport department's endeavor is to ensure that all the vehicles running on the roads adhere to pollution norms and do not add to air pollution./In order to ensure that the vehicles on road adhere to the pollution norms, the district transport office has installed air-pollution test kits at two places and has ordered the vehicle owners to get the fitness of their vehicles certified from the test centers about the level of fumes or pollutants being emitted by the particular vehicles./It may be mentioned here that exposure to air pollution leads to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. According to statistics, air pollution caused for 6,20,000 early deaths till 2010 across the country. As such, Bharat stage emission standards was set up by the Government of India to regulate the output of air pollutants from internal combustion engines including different types of motor vehicles. The standards and the timeline for implementation were fixed by the Central Pollution Control Board under the ministry of environment and forests and were first introduced in 2000, but now are being enforced strictly across the country in view of reports that many vehicles run flouting air-pollution norms./More than 450 vehicles have been checked during the 'Go green campaign' in Bhagalpur district of which 135 were found lacking air-pollution norms (fitness) certificate while 25 vehicles were seized for causing major air-pollution. The DTO collected Rs 1.4 lakh by way of penalty from the vehicles lacking air-pollution fitness certificate./District transport officer Jawaharlal Singh said the operation has been launched in the district following reports about vehicles not adhering to the air-pollution norms besides not getting their vehicles checked at air-pollution test centers and not keeping fitness certificate./MVI Santosh Kumar said surprise checking will also be undertaken apart from regular checking. Four more centers for examining the air-pollution fitness of the vehicles are being opened at different locations in the district, he said and added the campaign is also aimed at creating awareness about air pollution./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

He added that besides, residents of townships, villagers from dozen of villages and educational institutions in the region are facing a tough time./Not only the humans, but even animals and plants are facing problems due to the pollution caused by burning of garbage at trenching ground. Two years back, forest department had written a letter to IMC expressing concern over hazardous effects of burning garbage over flora, fauna and wild animals at Ralamandal Wildlife Sanctuary, which is located close to Devguradia trenching ground./During hearing of a case over garbage in September 2013, Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) in its affidavit had mentioned that around 4 km stretch near Devguradia trenching ground has been highly polluted due to huge pile of municipal waste and unauthorized burning of garbage, leading to low visibility and foul odour./MPPCB had mentioned that around 23,000 to 25,000 metric tonnes (MT) garbage is being dumped at the trenching ground every month, of which only 4500 MT garbage is being processed in a month. At present, 2.5 lakh MT of garbage is piled up at the ground./MPPCB has already filed a complaint against A2Z Company, which has the contract for collection and disposal of garbage, under Sections 21, 22, 37 and 40 of Pollution Free Environment Act.

Ashes from these bonfires can be spotted outside the bungalows. Most of the gardeners don't know they are breaking the law when they burn leaves. Nor do they know that they are harming themselves the most as they are the closest to/the smoke./It would appear our top ministers, law-makers and judges haven't taken the trouble to educate their gardeners--that they are committing an illegality when they burn leaves and harming themselves in the process. Nor have they told their staff about composting dry leaves which doesn't require any expensive technology./According to Chintan, an NGO working on waste management, composting can be laid in layers in the parks and covered with a wire mesh so that these don't fly around. Water can be sprinkled at regular intervals to enable it to mulch. This is already being done at the Neeti Bagh community centre. It can also be just buried in pits in the garden or avenues./The list of VVIPs in LBZ is long. Narendra Modi, Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, Rajnath Singh, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati, SC judges A K Sikri, V Gopala Gowda and Fakir Mod Ibrahim, attorney-general Mukul Rohatgi and additional solicitor-general L Nageswar Rao, election commissioner Nasim Zaidi--to name just a few. They run the country and yet allow an illegality right under their nose./According to an emissions inventory prepared by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) under the ministry of earth sciences, emissions increase by at least 15% due to waste burning in a 50km radius of Delhi. While dry leaves, twigs, paper and cardboard are often set on fire to create winter bonfires in the city, in surrounding rural areas tyres, plastics/and tubes are burnt releasing carcinogenic emissions like dioxin.

Air pollution affecting even foetal growth,"NEW DELHI: India may be heading towards an epidemic of babies born small, premature and with poor mental growth if urgent steps are not taken to curb air pollution, doctors have warned. This is in addition to lung ailments like asthma and heart diseases. Of all cities, Delhi is the most vulnerable as it has the highest pollution level./According to the experts, anything that affects the growth of organs tends to impact the foetus and newborns most. ""The high incidence of neural tube defect in newborns, where the spinal cord is not formed well even among well-nourished mothers, is a clear example. Other birth defects are also common,"" said Dr Neelam Kler, chairperson of the neonatology department at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH). She said the link between air pollution and birth defects was discussed at a World Health Organisation (WHO) meeting recently./According to the 2010 global burden of disease report, outdoor air pollution caused more than 6,20,000 premature deaths in India./READ ALSO:/Nearly 18 million healthy years of life were lost that year. In Delhi, experts fear, the health impact of air pollution could be higher due to heavy density of particulate matter.

Dr K Srinath Reddy, who is heading the committee, told TOI:/""Air pollution is playing havoc with people's health. The review of available medical/literature and clinical findings by top researchers reveals it is affecting people of all ages and has a role to play even in heart diseases that are generally associated with lifestyle factors.""/Dr Sandeep Salvi, director of Chest Research Foundation (CRF), said globally about eight million deaths are caused due to air pollution. ""In India, we have no such data at present. But clinical experience shows pollutants, particularly the particulate matter, are behind poor lung growth in children. It causes asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia which is a major killer in the age-group. Even in grown-ups, we are seeing high incidence of asthma and COPD,"" he said./The CRF recently did a study in which it found that Indians have 30% lower lung function as compared to Europeans. Things could get worse if immediate steps are not taken to curb vehicular emission, doctors warned./But the risk of air pollution does not end here. The most frightening impact of this preventable disaster could come in the form of lung cancer, warns Dr P K Julka, professor of oncology, at AIIMS. ""Several pollutants contain chemical carcinogens, such as benzene, form- aldehyde and polycyclic hydrocarbon, among others. It is slow poison and may certainly add to the burden of cancer in the country in the coming years if urgent steps to curb vehicular emission are not taken.""/Times View/The unacceptably high level of pollution in Delhi is threatening our children as well as the elderly. The health risks arising from foul urban air is well documented. The government has been pathetically lethargic in addressing this serious issue even when it was staring in the eye. Keeping air pollution in check is by no means an impossible task. Many cities around the world have shown how it can be done. It requires advance planning for building an effective public transport system, thus reducing the need for private vehicles. In Delhi, the Metro-a non-polluting mode of travel-is growing, but it wasn't planned sufficiently in advance to meet the growing city's transport needs. Lessons/must be learnt from this and other cities must build their/public transport system in advance before high emission levels choke them too./The government has no option but to take some drastic steps to speed up the public transport system and curb the number of cars on Delhi roads. For the former, the last-mile connectivity for the Metro must be built on a war footing. If the latter means higher parking charges, registration fee, banning smoke-spewing trucks from entering the city, setting up vehicle-free zones, so be it. Future generations can't be allowed to suffer for our squeamishness or selfishness. And in the meantime, the government must own up its responsibility for past omissions that have led to medical problems for people. It should subsidize, if not fully pay for the treatment of those suffering respiratory, heart ailments or skin problems caused by such high levels of pollution./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Government thrust on 'healthy housing' to combat TB,"PUNE: Cities like Pune and Mumbai, where substantial number of people live in unhealthy conditions, could get central assistance to provide housing for poor as part of the Central government's push for 'healthy housing' to curb airborne diseases such as tuberculosis (TB)./The Central government is all set to launch its ambitious smart city scheme next month. Experts and planners working with the central urban development department have suggested that the government should focus mainly on urban housing to resolve health and economic issues in the cities./According to Central government sources, the Union urban development department is working with the states' health departments to draft a strategy on 'healthy housing' to help eliminate TB by 2020./""The government of India has decided to take some major steps to streamline haphazard urbanization. Healthy housing is one part of this steps and the government is linking housing to TB eradication in urban areas. TB control should be taken up as both a development issue and a medical subject. Housing is one of the major factors in proliferation of TB in urban areas. The ongoing wave of urbanization has intensified the chances for the infection to spread in cities because of unhealthy living conditions. TB bacteria proliferate in congested slums with little ventilation,"" said one of the state health officials who attended the recent meet in New Delhi held by Union minister of urban development M Venkaiah Naidu./Chapal Mehra, an activist working with civil society groups on TB, said that cities like Pune and Mumbai have a major chunk of the population living in slums. About 60% in Mumbai and 40% Puneites live in slums, which have become a hotbed for TB proliferation. Mehra said that proper housing would help to curb spread of infection./""Slum rehabilitation schemes have not yielded any positive results. Instead, the number of slums in urban areas is on rise. Housing shortage in urban areas is expected to rise to 300 lakh units in 2022 from the present 190 lakh. India spent Rs 500 crore in fiscal 2013-14 on the treatment of tuberculosis, including providing free medicines. If we need to address TB at its root cause, we must focus on providing healthy living to people in urban areas,"" said a senior medical practitioner working with the government on the housing scheme./In 2011-12, the amount incurred on prevention and control of TB was Rs 391.16 crore, which went up to Rs 467 crore the next year. He added that the government was also consulting the world Health Organisation (WHO) in this regard./""There is a clear need and opportunity for governments and others to promote health in the course of making investments in housing. Examples of key housing-related health risks include respiratory and cardiovascular diseases from indoor air pollution, illness and deaths from temperature extremes, communicable diseases spread because of poor living conditions, and risks of home injuries. Inadequate ventilation is also associated with a higher risk of airborne infectious disease transmission, including tuberculosis,"" states the WHO document on Housing and Health. Poor housing quality and design also can exacerbate the health impacts from exposure to temperature extremes, which are occurring more frequently due to climate change, adds the document./Experts say that airborne bacteria know no boundaries and people in cities living in apartments and bungalows are not immune. ""TB should not be treated as problem of poor but as a problem of the entire society. Poor are more vulnerable to the TB and they come on record because they cannot afford private treatment. The rich generally go to private hospitals and prefer to keep mum on disease. But we have to keep in mind that the overall health environment of the city affects all.

Besides, a layer of smog shrouded the city the entire day./What is worse, there are more such bleak days ahead. According to System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) under the ministry of earth sciences, pollution will increase at an alarming level in the next few days with a daily average of over 200 micrograms per cubic metre. The low temperature and calm air are causing ""inversion"" that can lead to pollution such as smog being trapped close to the ground./Such poor air quality may trigger respiratory problems among people with low immunity, the elderly and the very young. Doctors fear poor air quality may be doing more damage than just triggering a few wheezing episodes. Constant exposure to bad air is making Delhiites vulnerable to arrhythmias and ischaemic heart disease. Arrhythmia is a disorder characterized by irregular heart beat or abnormal heart rhythm while ischaemic heart disease is associated with reduced blood supply to the heart./Dr S K Chhabra, head of cardiorespiratory physiology department of VB Patel Chest Institute, says continuous exposure to high air pollution levels is like being exposed to second-hand smoke. Recently, he made a detailed presentation on this before pollution control agency officials from Saarc countries./Chhabra quoted an AIIMS study which found higher number of complaints and instances of hospitalization due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) and coronary issues apart from asthma and other respiratory conditions during high pollution days. He also said exposure to diesel emissions causes allergic responses./""Fine particulate matter and gaseous pollutants are significant risk factors for acute stroke death. Women and the elderly are most susceptible to the effects of particulate air pollutants,"" his presentation said./Dr Ashwani Mehta, senior consultant cardiologist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital also believes the rise in incidence of strokes and arrhythmias are linked to high air pollution levels. ""The respiratory problems from bad air can affect the heart. Besides, air pollution can cause myocardial infarction or heart attacks. Unfortunately we don't have much data in India that can directly relate air pollution with the incidence of heart attacks. But increasingly we are seeing young people having heart attacks. Women who you don't expect to usually suffer heart attacks are increasingly reporting heart attacks. It's a combination of issues but I think particulate matter is also to blame.""/Oncologists are seeing a 1% to 2% rise in lung cancer incidence each year but again there is no documentation of how much of lung cancer incidence is linked to air pollution. Dr Vinod Raina, director and HOD, oncology and haematology at Fortis Hospital, said there was a ""slight increase in incidence of cancer among non-smokers. Otherwise, we need documentation to understand how much air pollution contributes to lung cancer.""/The Delhi government hasn't started alerting people on poor air quality days yet. Usually governments in the West as well as in China issue alerts so that the vulnerable population can take necessary health precautions. The National Green Tribunal has recently ordered a ban on more than 15 year old vehicles and asked the government to consider hiking parking fee, imposing a congestion charge on vehicles and increasing the registration fee for two and four-wheelers in Delhi./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Experts have suggested that high concentration of pollutants in the air results in dense haze and smog formation that lasts throughout the day, thus restricting sunlight to reach the surface./According to data collected from Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), particulate matter of size 10 micrometre (PM 10) levels at 5 locations of the city were found to be double to its permissible level of 100 microgram per cubic metre throughout the year. This clearly indicates high air pollution level in the city. Dr. Anirudh Dubey, weather scientist at Chandra Shekhar Azad Agriculture University (CSAU), said that fog, smog and haze, are all linked to atmospheric pollution that causes dimming of the sun's rays reaching the surface, leading to drop in day temperature./""During winters dirt particles sublimate with water vapours and become heavy, thereby hanging at lower level of the atmosphere. When sun rays break during the day, this smog absorbs the heat energy and starts evaporating. But, by the time they evaporate completely, it is already evening and the vapour formation begins again. In other words, heavy smog/formation traps all sun energy, without letting it reach the surface. This results in drastic dip in temperature during afternoon hours,"" he explained./The highest PM 10 levels were recorded from Panki area (217.9 microgram per cubic metre) which were over two times the standard, while the lowest levels were recorded at Kidwai Nagar (184.5 microgram per cubic metre) and Avas Vikas Kalyanpur (194.4 microgram per cubic metre)./However, these levels were nearly twice more than the normal level. Jareeb Chowki and Shastri Nagar also recorded high pollution levels with 215.8 and 208.3 microgram per cubic metre respectively./Talking about weather conditions in near future, the expert said that similar foggy conditions would prevail for another few days. However, the arrival of easterly winds in the first week of January will result in cloud formation. ""As soon as the easterly winds arrive, the sublimated water vapours with dirt will begin to condense and form clouds./It will give way to light showers at few isolated areas of the city. This will bring down foggy conditions and slight relief from the dipping temperatures,"" he concluded./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Kolkata inhales poison in every breath,"KOLKATA: It's a known fact that depleting green cover and rapid increase in vehicular traffic are taking a toll on the city's ambient air quality. But how serious is the damage? If results of the tests conducted by the US embassy are anything to go by, it's time that the authorities sit up and take note of the grave situation./These tests give us a clearer picture as they take into account fine particles less than 2.5 micron in diameter. These particles can aggravate lung disease, cause asthma attack and acute bronchitis. PM 2.5 is a standard recognized by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB), on the other hand, follows the PM 10 method that monitor only dust particles that are 10 microns in diameter./Significantly, WBPCB has not been operating nine manual stations despite the Green Tribunal order for immediate operation of these centres. Only two automatic stations - one at Victoria Memorial and other on the Rabindra Bharati University campus - have been operating round the clock./WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra said, ""Manual monitoring station cannot be run round the clock. If they are run more than 24 hours, reading will be inaccurate. We are trying to set up more automatic monitoring centres. Two are in the pipeline - one in Howrah and the other in Durgapur.""/The US Consulate General's air pollution monitor is has set the alarm bell ringing. From December 21 to 28, the concentration of fine particulate matter in the city's air remained unhealthy, varying from 234 \xB5g/m\xB3 to 261\xB5g/m\xB3. The permissible limit is 50. According to US health standard, such concentration of PM 2.5 may aggravate heart or lung diseases./People with heart or lung diseases, older adults and children should avoid all physical activity outdoors. Others should avoid prolonged or heavy exertion, revealed US consulate cautionary words. ""PM 2.5 is dangerous as these fine particles goes straight to our lungs and other vital organs and does the biggest harm,"" said an automobile pollution expert Somendramohan Ghosh./WBPCB chief scientist Ujjwal Mukherjee said, ""The reason for higher pollution level in the city is high concentration human activity like vehicular movement compared to other cities."" Ghosh added that a meteoric rise of diesel-run vehicles has led to such high concentration of PM 2.5. It is high time to introduce bio-diesel. ""Mixture of bio-diesel, extracted from the non-edible vegetable oils (like Jatropha seed oil) would not only lessen the pressure on foreign exchange exchequer but also reduce the pollution to a great extent. The direct mixture of 20% bio-diesel at the depot level is permissible in India,"" he added./Earlier, Kolkata's ambient air was found most polluted among eight Asian countries - Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Malayasia, India and Japan. The study was to identify the source of persistent organic pollutants. The research was undertaken by scientist Dr Mahua Saha at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Peak pollution was high even after showers in Delhi: NGO,"NEW DELHI: Ahead of the US President Barack Obama's visit to Delhi, Greenpeace India, an environmental NGO tracked air pollution levels at various locations in Delhi which he is likely to visit. Greenpeace campaigners used a portable air quality monitoring device, PDR-1500, bought from US. Greenpeace's reality check of PM2.5 levels on Friday revealed that peak air pollution levels spiked to alarming levels even after the rain on Thursday helped wash out the pollutants and the 24-hour average came down./""Exposure to fine particulate matter pollution is the largest environmental health risk in the world, upping the risk of lung cancer, stroke, heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, lower respiratory infections and asthma. PM2.5 is estimated to have been responsible for over three million premature deaths in 2010,"" Greenpeace's statement on Friday said. It also referred to The International Agency for Research on Cancer which classified particulate matter pollution as carcinogenic to humans in 2013, and designated it as a ""leading environmental cause of cancer deaths""./Unreliable data from government agencies has led to individual researchers and advocacy groups using battery-operated portable devices that measure people's personal exposure to air pollution. ""Delhi has been breathing extremely poor air this winter with daily PM2.5 averages peaking to 320 micrograms per cubic metres, six times the Indian safety standard and 14 times that of the World Health Organization's. I hope the government recognizes the urgency to act and safeguard the health of citizens,"" Aishwarya Madineni of Greenpeace India said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Morning drizzle spares Delhi air quality blushes,"NEW DELHI: The air on Monday around India Gate was relatively clean, thanks to unexpected rain during the Republic Day parade. Even though the PM2.5 (fine, respirable particle) level was high between 6 and 6.30am-at about 200 micrograms per cubic metre, it had begun to fall by 9.30am, at 11am it was 107 micrograms-less than twice the Indian safe standard of 60 micrograms. Only a cloudy sky and the drizzle partially affected the experience./Favourable meteorology thus helped the government avoid the embarrassment of severe air pollution during US President Barack Obama's visit with an assessment by Gufran Beig, project director, System of Air quality Weather Forecasting and Research, claiming the 24-hour average on 26 January was only at 80 micrograms per cubic metre. Delhi Pollution Control Committee's real time air quality monitoring, however, suggested that the levels, measured at the station closest to central Delhi, were just over 100 micrograms per cubic metre. Traffic volume, too, was low today./Short-term exposure to pollution levels such as those in Delhi today cannot do significant harm to health, say experts, and so the US delegation may not be affected. But air pollution is considered an issue of international debate owing to its impact on the health of those who are consistently being exposed to very bad air./Experts, meanwhile, say air pollution this winter has been one of the worst seen so far. PM2.5 levels on some days in early December were as high as 400 micrograms per cubic metre, about six times the Indian standard, and 11 times the US safe standard of 35 micrograms per cubic metre./According to Global Burden of Disease's 2010 report, air pollution is the fifth largest killer in India. The report found that, in 2010, about 6,20,000 premature deaths occurred in India due to pollution-related diseases. The World Health Organization urban air quality database last year showed Delhi to be having the highest PM2.5 levels among 1,600 global cities including Beijing./In fact, an indoor air purifier company even claimed in a statement on January 24 that the US Embassy in Delhi has purchased several air purifiers to tackle indoor air pollution. Last year Delhi and Beijing were embroiled in major debate about which city is more polluted./Some Chinese cities have PM2.5 levels comparable to Delhi. Chinese authorities reportedly blocked air pollution data during the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in November last year which Obama and Vladimir Putin attended because the particulate matter levels were extremely high./In a joint statement with PM Narendra Modi, Obama said the US has agreed to provide data to track and reduce air pollution levels in India./Even though the PM2.5 level was high between 6am and 6.30am-at about 200 micrograms per cubic metre-it fell by 9.30am. At 11am it was 107 micrograms- less than twice the Indian safe standard./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Britain's ethnic minorities breathing most polluted air,"LONDON: Britain's ethnic minorities are breathing the most polluted air./A first of its kind scientific analysis has found a big difference in air pollution across communities in England, with deprived and ethnic minority areas the worst affected./Air pollution levels are linked to many forms of ill health, including higher risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, especially for more vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly./Researchers at Imperial College London and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands examined data on two types of air pollution: particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). They compared air pollution exposures for small areas in England and the Netherlands with population characteristics including deprivation, ethnic makeup, and proportions of children and elderly people./The EU Ambient Air Quality Directive set limits of 40 micrograms per cubic metre (\xB5g/m3) at monitoring stations for both PM10 and NO2 pollution. Concentration averages across all neighbourhoods in England and all but two neighbourhoods in the Netherlands were within this limit for PM10, but 11% of neighbourhoods in England and nine per cent in the Netherlands exceeded the NO2 limit, accounting for an affected population of 5.4 million and 2.7 million respectively./In England, the most deprived 20% of neighbourhoods had higher air pollution levels than the least deprived neighbourhoods - 1.5 \xB5g/m3 higher PM10 and 4.4 \xB5g/m3 NO2 after adjusting for other factors - but this was not the case in the Netherlands. The biggest differences in air pollution levels according to socioeconomic status were in London./The worst air pollution levels were seen in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods, defined as those where more than 20% of the population are non-white. Even after allowing for the fact that some of these neighbourhoods are more deprived, in England, this difference was 3.0 \xB5g/m3 for PM10 and 10.1 \xB5g/m3 for NO2. In the Netherlands, differences were lower, with 1.1 \xB5g/m3 higher PM10 and 4.5 \xB5g/m3 NO2./Lead researcher Dr Daniela Fecht from the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, said ""The study highlights the fact that inequalities in exposure to air pollution are mainly an urban problem, suggesting that measures to reduce environmental air pollution inequality should focus on cutting vehicle emissions in deprived urban neighbourhoods""./The reasons for the associations between ethnic minorities and air pollution are unclear. ""England and the Netherlands have a long history of immigration. It's possible that immigrants settled in particular areas may tolerate poorer air quality for the benefits of living close to friends and family, even when their communities become less deprived,"" said Dr Fecht./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
NGT sends notice to Agra over rise in air pollution,"Agra: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has sent notices to Agra and seven other cities over the sharp surge in air pollution levels due to increase in number of privately-owned petrol and diesel-run vehicles./Concerned over the unbridled rise in air pollution levels in the city, the environmental protection agency has also sought recommendations from the administrations of Uttar Pradesh and other states to counter rising private ownership of multiple vehicles and ways to tackle pollution-causing vehicles./Similar notices have been issued to New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Bangalore, Allahabad, Hyderabad and Agra through the chief secretaries of their respective states./The notice comes after city-based paediatric surgeon Sanjay Kulshrestha, in his letter to the NGT, wrote about how deteriorating air quality would have an ""adverse impact"" on the health of fetuses, newborn babies and children as ""they are likely to develop congenital and acquired diseases""./The doctor, in his application, also touched upon the ""tremendous increase in vehicles"" on roads, and how it was ""adding to the pollution of ambient air quality in the country, especially the metros"". Kulshrestha further stated that there were about 19.5 crore motor vehicles on Indian roads in March 2014, and every year 1.5 crore new vehicles are expected to roll out on the roads./He added that ""construction of roads and bridges was not the solution as purification efforts would always be out-classed by pollution resulting from number of vehicles. The increasing number of vehicles every year would frustrate any specified standards"". He said the steep burgeoning of number of cars would render all efforts ""futile""./Instead, he felt, a law should be made on fixing the number of four-wheelers a family can own. He also recommended the green tribunal to fix an age-limit for every car, beyond which using it would be deemed illegal. He also stressed on the importance of ""controlling"" the number of luxury cars as they are not fuel-efficient./Finding merit in his suggestion, the NGT, headed by chairperson Swatanter Kumar, has pressed the ministry of environment, forest (MoEF) and ministry of petroleum to take ""actual steps"", and not ""mere paper work"" to ""show results on the ground""./The tribunal order read: ""We do find substance in the submissions made on behalf of the applicant. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent submits that MoEF has provided the prescribed standard and Ministry of Petroleum has framed policy for use of fuel in 2003. The submissions made on behalf of the State are hardly of any relevance and consequence.""/In its January 23 order, the NGT also directed concerned secretary of NCT of Delhi and additional secretaries of ministry of environment and forest (MoEF), ministry of petroleum, ministry of transport and ministry of health to hold a meeting and bring out a workable resolution to ensure controlling of air pollution in Agra and the seven metropolitan cities./The case will come for hearing once again on February 25./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Experts bank on US air quality alert,"NEW DELHI: US and India haven't spelt out how their partnership on addressing air pollution will roll out, but scientists and advocacy groups are already excited about the possibilities. They say the partnership can help generate real-time, reliable air quality data for all cities, to begin with./Low-cost, innovative technology that can be deployed immediately in all major Indian cities can help clear the air, which is the main problem. Experts, like Sarath Guttikunda, associate research professor at the Desert Research Institute, Reno, suggested that establishing a national public health alert system on the lines of US Environment Protection Agency (USEPA)'s AirNow programme, which issues real-time air quality index (AQI) data for 400 cities in US, will be beneficial./The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which has the mandate of monitoring air quality and issuing health alerts, has ""failed miserably"", according to scientists who are now resorting to other agencies to get reliable data. ""They have no real-time data for most cities and do not follow any calibration protocol, which is why there is a huge difference in the results of air quality monitoring by different agencies,"" said a scientist./MoEFCC had launched an air quality index (AQI) last year. But, according to some committee members who helped formulate the AQI, CPCB's real time monitoring system has too many glitches and doesn't have enough automatic monitoring stations -only 16 out of 246./Joshua Apte, assistant professor, University of Texas at Austin, who is running a unique research study in Delhi on monitoring exposure to air pollution in heavy traffic junctions, said he was excited that American scientists will have something to offer now. ""The first step is just to expand the existing network of monitors. There are less than 50 real-time PM2.5 monitors that are reporting data to the web in India, as compared with nearly 2,000 in China. Other pollutants also need to be monitored,"" he said. This may also help point at the real sources by applying advanced 'source apportionment' techniques like 'vehicles versus biomass burning versus regional haze'./Anumita Roychowdhury of CSE's Clean Air programme said, ""We need low cost technology to monitor air quality that can be immediately and easily deployed across cities. US is doing innovative things like roadside exposure monitoring. Moving as soon as possible to superior fuel norms -Euro 6 among others-should be done now."" Since the collaboration will also cover the government's pet project of smart cities, she says it's time to set norms and guidelines to reduce dependence on personal vehicles./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
COPD cases on rise due to pollution,"VISAKHAPATNAM: Instances of chronic respiratory illnesses such as COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder) are on the rise in key AP cities, exacerbated mainly by air pollution and aided by cold weather, early morning smog and the habit of smoking./Medical experts point out that COPD cases are no longer just restricted to the elderly but are also being detected even in younger age groups and with wide scale industrialisation taking place in cities like Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada, such cases may go up further in the coming days./According to doctors, the main symptoms of COPD are continuous cough with sputum and breathlessness. In a patient suffering from COPD, diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the blood do not take place properly. As a result, adequate oxygen doesn't reach the blood through lungs and more amount of carbon dioxide is retained in the body, causing difficulty in breathing. A chest x-ray and pulmonary function test can reveal the progression of the disease./Dr M Ravindranath, pulmonologist from Andhra Hospital, Vijayawada, said, ""Two-three years ago, only 20-25% of the total patients suffering from various chest ailments had COPD and it was mainly in the elderly population. But nowadays, their number has gone up to 30-35% with even those in their 40s and 50s suffering from COPD mainly due to smoking and increase in air-pollution. Nowadays, out of 10 patients, we see at least 3-4 suffering from COPD.""/Agreeing, Dr Sambasiva Rao, medical superintendent of Government Chest Hospital, Visakhapatnam, said that cases of chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD have gone up due to increase in pollution levels as well as the presence of smog in the winter season.

'Green tax' on vehicles older than 15 yrs,"Regional Transport Office (RTO) in the city has started collection of 'green tax' from the vehicles that are 15-year-old. A total one-time tax of 10% of the tax that was paid at the time of first registration will be charged at the time of re-registration of the two or four-wheeler after it crosses its valid limit of 15 years./Green tax or environmental tax is a tax imposed on environmental pollutants or on goods whose repeated use contributes to pollution./The state government has decided to impose the tax to limit the number of old vehicles in the city, thereby curbing air pollution. The current emission standard of vehicles is 'Bharat 4', which produce considerably low smoke. The RTO officials suggest that implementation of the new tax will limit the smoke emitting vehicles in the city. ""Green Taxes are one of a variety of policy measures formulated by the government to control activities which affect the environment. The purpose of these environmental taxes is to reduce the extent of use of old vehicles that are not upgraded as per the new standards of pollutions./It is believed that because of fear of paying 10% tax on every re-registration, people would opt to discard their old vehicles. This besides curbing increasing pollution in the city will also limit the number of vehicles,"" said ARTO, SK Singh./""A total of 10% of the one-time tax that was paid at the time of the first registration will be charged during the re-registration. This means that if a person had paid Rs. 50,000 at the time of first registration, he will have to pay Rs. 5000 as 'green tax' after 15 years. It will be imposed on two-wheelers and four-wheelers bought in the year 2000,"" he added./Till now for re-registering a two-wheeler, the owner was charged with a nominal fee of Rs. 30, while four-wheelers had to pay Rs. 200. But, from now onwards, they will have to pay 10% 'green tax'. According to the RTO officials, the state government would be using the 'green fund' for upgrading the infrastructure of the state. They said that since their online registration system is not upgraded according to the new norms, the re-registration work will be done manually in the RTO offices situated in Sarvodaya Nagar./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Household pollution - the killer behind your doors,"Pollution, of any form, has always been a major concern for our society.

But, how many of you really think that this pollution is present outside your doors, only?/For those of you who think staying indoor can save you from any form of pollution, let me share some insight on one of the lesser known yet equally harmful kind of pollution. I am talking about Household pollution./Yes, you read that right! We humans are not safe from the clutches of this devil in disguise even when we sit comfortably at home./To give you a better perspective on what I am referring to, let me site an excerpt from the WHO website./There is consistent evidence that exposure to household air pollution can lead to acute lower respiratory infections in children under five, and ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer in adults. In 2012, household air pollution was responsible for 7.7% of the global mortality./So what is this hullabaloo about Household pollution?/Well to make it simple, let's put it this say way; several countries all over the world are fast moving to an age of urbanization blessed with bio gas connections, modular kitchens and designer homes but there are still people (almost three billion) worldwide who continue to depend on solid fuels, including biomass fuels (wood, dung, agricultural residues) and coal, for their energy needs./Such inefficient cooking and heating practices produce high levels of household (indoor) air pollution which includes a range of health damaging pollutants such as fine particles and carbon monoxide./Being an agricultural country, India has almost 70% of its total population dwelling in rural areas. And it's not hard to picture a typical country side home with a rural stove or a chullah, as we call it, which using biomass cakes as cooking fuel./The biomass cakes when burnt, produces smoke and numerous indoor air pollutants at concentrations five times higher than coal! Now, you can imagine the health risk it causes to people living in rural India./But that's not all../Before the urban dwellers, rejoice for being free from biomass cakes, coal or wood as fuel consumption, let me divulge details of other indoor air pollutants./I assume, all of us must have noticed some black- and dark-green slimy patches carrying a powerful musty odor below the kitchen sink that we so often pass over as nothing important./Well, those slimy patches are called Stachybotrys chartarum, or black mold, a fungus that can produce toxins and has been linked to illness and severe allergies. And what causes that is a large amount of moisture in an area./So, how can you deal with that? Simple. Regular use of kitchen exhaust ventilation systems can help control excess moisture in the home, hence reducing the risk of mold formation./A good exhaust system is also very important in every household to cut the risk of other harmful toxins arising out of cooking fuels./So, if you care about those lovely ladies, be it your mum, wife, sister, daughter or anybody for that matter who breathes in a kitchen to dish out delicious delicacies for you, you must assure they have proper ventilation./And, can you avoid these contaminants in your daily life?/- Detergents, furniture polish, camphor, paints, stain removers, and even cosmetics/- Insecticides, pesticides, and fertilizers that are used for maintaining one's lawn and garden. Their entry into the house could occur through air movement or adsorption by shoes and toys, which are then brought inside the house/- Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Sources include paint strippers and other solvents, wood preservatives, air fresheners, automotive products. Even your dry cleaned clothing/- Rug cleaners, and wet cell batteries/- New flooring, basement remodeling, hanging new cabinets, removing asbestos sheets, scraping off old paint (which might contain lead), and the removal or application of wallpaper/- The above list is long but not exhaustive and I am sure you know what that means. Indoor pollution surrounds us all, no matter which walk of life we come from./Now, I don't mean to scare you, but you must know some of the potential health effects of these indoor pollutants./For e.g, furniture polishes which Irritates skin, eyes, throat, nose and lungs. Getting your house texture painted, consider this. Paints - irritates skin, eyes, nose and throat can even cause respiratory system damage. And what about the toilet bowl cleaner? That's toxic in nature; burns skin; causes digestive and respiratory system damage. And do you know Air fresheners & deodorizers can irritates eyes, nose, throat, skin, and damage nervous, digestive & respiratory system/Adopt alternatives to avoid exposure and go green!/There's plenty of green alternatives available for us that can helps us make our homes toxin free. Thanks to media, there's been plenty of buzz about nature friendly products and I already see the sudden inclination of people of all ages towards 'all things green'./What I suggest personally, is that we should inform and encourage everyone specially people from lower income houses like your maid or the driver, to start using proper gas connections, ventilation system and other natural options to save their lives from the risk of toxins and other carcinogenic chemicals./By Dr Arvind Kumar.

Every Bengalurean smokes 6 cigarettes a day!,"BENGALURU: Air pollution is emerging as a grave concern. Putting it simply, the extent of ultra-fine particulate matter in the air in New Delhi, for instance, is equivalent to the harm caused to an individual smoking 20 cigarettes a day. The corresponding figure is less puffed up in Bengaluru: it is akin to every Bengalurean smoking six cigarettes daily./This revelation was made by experts quoting data from UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) at the 6th GRIHA Regional Conference hosted by TERI in their city campus on Wednesday./According to UNEP statistics, in Delhi, the ultra-fine particulate (less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter) presence in the air stood at an annual average of 153 microgram per cubic metre in 2012. Bengaluru's annual average was put at 45./Particulate matter present in the air is a composition of dust, fine and ultra-fine particles./Pointing out that the data pertained to 2012, experts said the situation could have only deteriorated further in two years./According to the UNEP, between 2005 and 2010, death due to pollution rose by 4% worldwide, by 5% in China and 12% in India. Worldwide, 3.5 million people die each year from outdoor air pollution. A high 1.3 million Indians die every year of poor indoor air quality, the second biggest killer after high blood pressure./Outdoor air is the biggest indoor air pollution source, if it is not properly filtered and purified before being let indoors./Other indoor air pollution sources include tobacco smoking, copy machines and printers, cleaning products, mould growth, paints, solvents and other construction materials, new furniture and scents (perfumes, incense sticks) among others./Among the sources of outdoor air pollution are vehicle emissions, coal power plants, chullahs and other open fire cooking, burning of waste, industrial emissions and open sewage systems./""We have zero immunity against particulate pollution. Contrary to popular belief, we should not sterilize our homes, offices and schools from all bacteria, as that reduces our immunity. Air cleaners that sterilize the air (including UV-light) or ozonisers (ozone is a lung irritant) should not be used in homes, schools and offices.

"Smaller the pollutant, bigger the problem when it enters lungs","They are 100 times finer than human hair, and deadlier. While residents are up in arms every time an industry or a garbage dumpyard comes up near their neigh bourhood, they are oblivious to the dangers posed by smaller and seemingly in nocuous pollutants that are more harmful than those visible. Particle pollution es pecially fine particles from exhaust fumes of ve hicles and smoke con tains microscopic solids or liquid droplets that are so small that they can pene trate deep into the lungs and result in serious health ail ments.

""The smaller the particle, the bigger the problem,"" said Dr R Sridha ran, who runs an asthma and al lergy treatment centre in the city. The particles go deeper into the lungs, and even enter the blood stream. While the link between respiratory ailments and air pollution is well known, doctors say smaller pollutants can affect the heart and lead to premature death./""Unlike coarse particulate matter like metal, pollens and mould that are filtered in the upper respiratory tract, smaller particles pass through and enter the smaller airways that are connected to the lungs' air sacs,"" said Dr Sridharan. He said unlike coarse particles that cause cough, irritation and cold, fine particles don't trigger an immediate re sponse. ""It's a slow death of sorts.It later surfaces in the form of bronchitis, asthma, pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and slows down the function of the heart.""/The impact of the particles on the lungs, in turn, takes a toll on the heart. ""A reduced lung function means blood that is not oxygenated properly is being pumped into the heart. This could cause hypertension and affect cardiac functions,"" said Dr M Manimaran.He said the effect of prolonged exposure to dust will surface 10 to 15 years later. Some of these particles have high quantities of toxins such as dioxins, sulphur and other carcinogenic compounds./Doctors say the most vulnerable are people with heart or lung diseases, the elderly and children as their defence system is weak./According to this year's Global Burden of Disease estimates, onefifth of deaths across the world occur from outdoor air pollution.It is also the fifth leading cause of deaths in India./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Gurgaon air quality comes under the radar,"Panic buttons are being pressed in Delhi over its air quality. The report that bad air can cut an Indian's life by over three years has come as a shocker. If this is the average figure for the entire country, the situation would be far more critical in Delhi, reportedly the most polluted city in the world./In fact, one environmentalist even speculated that President Barack Obama's three-day stay in India's capital may have abridged his time on the Earth by six hours./Beijing was supposed to have a high level of atmospheric pollution. Today Delhi beats that too. Dirty air leads to heart and lung diseases, and shortened life spans. The most lethal killer is PM 2.5 which is fine particulate matter that creeps insidiously into the lungs and starts the damage. The nagging cough that does not go away is just the beginning./Gurgaon should be even more worried. Basically the entire NCR falls under one atmospheric roof. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) releases its own monthly data on air pollution. Its website has regular figures for PM 10, but not on the finer PM 2.5 (though sources in the Board say that they will start collating this data too on a weekly basis fairly soon.)/However, a recent one-time study by the Centre for Science and Environment in Gurgaon showed that the level of the finer killer is 13 times the safe national standard. The hourly average of PM 2.5 during peak evening hours hovered around 1,000 micrograms per cubic metre (mgcm) against the safe level of 60mgcm. Other emissions, such as carbon and nitrogen compounds, are extras. A few factors aggravate the problem here./First, there is more building activity here per square kilometre than in the capital. Delhi has more or less been built and done with. We see some sporadic construction, but nothing like the scale at which concrete structures and roads are coming up in Gurgaon. More buildings mean more excavations and more dust. It is the same for laying roads. Once work starts on any new road one has to be prepared for endless delays. Ask the people living along Golf Course Road what it is to breathe toxins floating around on the wings of dust particles for months on end. A similar situation prevails in the never-ending road work around Cyber City.

Gurgaon air quality comes under the radar,"Panic buttons are being pressed in Delhi over its air quality. The report that bad air can cut an Indian's life by over three years has come as a shocker. If this is the average figure for the entire country, the situation would be far more critical in Delhi, reportedly the most polluted city in the world./In fact, one environmentalist even speculated that President Barack Obama's three-day stay in India's capital may have abridged his time on the Earth by six hours./Beijing was supposed to have a high level of atmospheric pollution. Today Delhi beats that too. Dirty air leads to heart and lung diseases, and shortened life spans. The most lethal killer is PM 2.5 which is fine particulate matter that creeps insidiously into the lungs and starts the damage. The nagging cough that does not go away is just the beginning./Gurgaon should be even more worried. Basically the entire NCR falls under one atmospheric roof. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) releases its own monthly data on air pollution. Its website has regular figures for PM 10, but not on the finer PM 2.5 (though sources in the Board say that they will start collating this data too on a weekly basis fairly soon.)/However, a recent one-time study by the Centre for Science and Environment in Gurgaon showed that the level of the finer killer is 13 times the safe national standard. The hourly average of PM 2.5 during peak evening hours hovered around 1,000 micrograms per cubic metre (mgcm) against the safe level of 60mgcm. Other emissions, such as carbon and nitrogen compounds, are extras. A few factors aggravate the problem here./First, there is more building activity here per square kilometre than in the capital. Delhi has more or less been built and done with. We see some sporadic construction, but nothing like the scale at which concrete structures and roads are coming up in Gurgaon. More buildings mean more excavations and more dust. It is the same for laying roads. Once work starts on any new road one has to be prepared for endless delays. Ask the people living along Golf Course Road what it is to breathe toxins floating around on the wings of dust particles for months on end. A similar situation prevails in the never-ending road work around Cyber City. No one seems to be in any hurry to finish any job./Motorized traffic emits toxic smoke everywhere, but Gurgaon has 232 such vehicles per 1,000 persons compared to Delhi's 120.

Foul Delhi air may be driving people to suicide,"NEW DELHI: The link between air pollution and respiratory diseases is well known, but foul air may be causing cases of depression too. Michael Brauer, professor at School of Population and Public Health at University of British Columbia who specializes in air pollution studies, told TOI that scientists are increasingly seeing links between air pollution and the mind./Studies have found that suicides and attempted suicides increase as levels of air pollution rise. This is because of the inflammatory effects of air pollution on body and mind. Brauer, who spoke at Anil Agarwal Dialogue 2015 organized by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), told TOI in an interview that masks and air purifiers may not be very effective in addressing the scale of the problem, and the strategy should be to bring down air pollution in cities. ""Masks work only when they are fixed professionally. It also depends on the kind of mask being used. N 95 (a type of mask) may be effective if it's worn properly without any gaps,"" he said./Prolonged exposure to high levels of pollutants can cause lung cancer and heart disease, but short-term exposure, for instance at traffic junctions, can trigger stroke or chronic asthma. ""Air pollution is affecting or leading to almost all the major conditions. It can be responsible for developing heart disease and triggering a heart attack, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, lung cancer... We are also seeing a very strong link between infections and air pollution. It is more difficult for our bodies to fight infection. Ear infections are very common, especially among young children; they start as respiratory infection and move to the ears,"" he said./Brauer said scientists are seeing links between air pollution and diabetes, premature births and anxiety. ""These are all part of inflammation caused by air pollution. There are studies showing that when air pollution peaks, the incidence of suicide rises. The problem is, pollution particles are not living things like bacteria that can be killed."" He added that pollution particles may be carriers of proteins that trigger allergies./""I think the most effective thing is, reducing pollution in total. Only the higher income groups can buy small air filters. The emphasis should be on general health-diet and physical activity, and reducing other risk factors such as smoking and alcohol.""/Brauer said curbing air pollution has immediate positive effects.

"Bio-fuel cooking methods no more a safe option, say doctors","MADURAI: If you think cooking with bio-fuel is a safe option, think twice. Experts say that though such cooking methods are employed on a large-scale in many household across the city, very few are aware of its risk factors as it results in respiratory symptoms. Bio-fuel stoves emit smoke that contains black carbon generating indoor air pollution and causes breathing problems, cough and asthma, they say./""It is important that women are aware of the health hazards caused by using the traditional bio-fuel cooking stove. The black carbon, which is emitted in the form of smoke causes many health complications and is also harmful for the environment. Families must consider using electric stove to avoid the ill-effects of black carbon,"" said Mridula Ramesh, executive director and convenor of Indian Women Network Madurai Zone./According to the 2011 census, around 166 million households in India use the traditional bio-fuel stoves. Statistics also reveal that states like Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh use more bio-fuel stoves. In Bihar alone, 90% of the households use bio-fuel./Burning of wood, crop waste and dung results in black smoke which creates maximum damage to women since they tend the fire. Statistics show that around eight million households in Tamil Nadu use bio-fuel, but very few are aware of its health hazards like asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). According to a report from the World Health Organisation, babies are born underweight in those families where bio-fuel is used./M Palaniappan, a pulmonologist from a city hospital said, ""In India, around 30% of women suffer from COPD due to the usage of traditional bio-fuel stoves. Those using bio-fuel should ensure proper ventilation to push out the excessive smoke. Prolonged exposure to black smoke may also cause lung cancer. Moreover, oxygen levels in pregnant women with respiratory problems will come down and can directly affect the babies."" Doctors also said the ill-effects of black carbon from bio-fuel stove is more harmful that smoking. The exposure to black smoke causes the lung passage to lose elasticity and thicken the passage. P Krishnamurthy, a chest physician said, ""The damage to the lungs of a person exposed to black smoke is similar when compared to the damage caused to a smoker. It is time families chose electric stoves over traditional cooking methods.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Diet to minimise harmful effects of air pollution!,"Can't lessen air pollution? You could, at least, keep your system immune to its harmful reactions.../Take a deep breath.

WHO says Delhi's air quality is worse than Beijing \xAD a city where rising levels of air pollution has brought about a new disease \xAD- Beijing cough./Experts feel that general public doesn't even know what exactly constitutes air pollution. ""Air contamination is caused not just by industries and vehicles. Dust mites, chemicals in carpets, air fresheners, off-gassing from plastics also add up to the toxic onslaught that your lungs have to bear,"" says Priya Dhammi-Sharma, registered holistic nutritionist .What' s alarming is that air pollution is not just linked to sinus infections, asthma and lung diseases, but also considered to be an autism trigger. It is also linked to heart attacks, sperm mutation and fetal intelligence wellbeing./BROCCOLI, THE BOOSTER/""Keep your immune system fortified with the right diet, detox plan and breathing exercises. These are the best ways to minimise the harmful effects of air pollution,"" says nutritionist and food consultant Jia Singh. Winter or no winter, add broccoli to your daily diet. This wonder veggie, apart from being a great cancer combatant, goes a long way in protecting you from air and vehicular pollution, ac cording to a study at Johns Hopkins University. A clinical trial, conducted in Jiangsu Province -one of China's most polluted regions -found that consuming a beverage that included broccoli sprouts helped participants to excrete toxins associated with ozone air pollution. To neutralise free radical damage caused by air contamination, the two organs we need to support and detoxify regularly are lungs and liver. ""Rejuvenate your lungs with oregano, orange peel, eucalyptus and peppermint and eat grapefruits, beet, carrots, apples, cabbage, avocado for a clean liver,"" says Sharma./According to Singh, Vitamin C taken in dietary and supplement form along with tincture of echinacea (herbal remedy) helps build the immune system, making you less susceptible to allergies. Simply put, foods containing Vitamin C, such as oranges, strawberries, apples, watermelons, counteract the inflammatory allergic response. Good food sources of Vitamin C are guavas, red bell peppers, kale, parsley, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, papayas, spinach, citrus fruits, green onion and more./NATURAL CURES/Thai and Japanese food lovers would be pleased to know that spicy foods with a little kick can actually kick out allergy symptoms. Ginger, anise, fennel and hot mustard can all act as natural decongestants. ""Green tea, tulsi, ginger and cinnamon are powerful adaptogens (herbal ingredients used to improve the health of adrenal system) that enable the body to handle stressors like pollution and environmental toxins. Raw turmeric also has curative properties that protect you from chronic bronchitis, wheezing, allergy coughs and colds.Drink an anti-inflammatory tea made from tulsi, ginger and raw turmeric to see the difference,"" recommends Singh. Eating a diet rich in natural antihistamines (drugs for allergies) can help forestall allergic reactions. Try magnesium-rich foods such as almonds, cashews and wheat bran since magnesium is a natural bronchodilator (agent that relaxes the breathing tubes inside lungs). ""Omega-3 fatty acids are also capable of reducing allergic reactions and soothe inflammation.

'India must leapfrog to Euro VI as benefits outweigh costs',"NEW DELHI: The International Council on Clean Transportation has written to minister of state for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan, recommending India skip Euro V fuel norms and move directly to Euro VI in 2020./Supporting its proposal with white papers, ICCT has argued that moving to Euro VI is better strategy because ""its air quality and public health benefits far exceed costs and fully justify the investment in producing ultra-low-content sulphur fuel"" and because the measure ""will have greater economic benefits in terms of lives protected from pollution-related health impacts""./The Auto Fuel Policy Committee for 2025 has recommended Euro V be implemented by April 2020 and Euro VI by April 2024. But ICCT has highlighted that implementing Euro V may not address high emission of nitrogen oxides from heavy duty vehicles-linked to emphysema, bronchitis and heart disease./ICCT's white paper that has assessed the effectiveness of Euro V globally also highlights that ""for heavy duty vehicles Euro V standards have not achieved hoped-for reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions"". Also, Euro VI standards lower PM emissions by 67% compared to Euro IV and Euro V. They allow for use of diesel particulate filters. DPFs have been used to meet PM standards for heavy duty vehicles sold in the US since 2007 and have proved to be very effective in reducing ultra-fine pollution particles, air toxics and black carbon./As of now, Delhi and 12 other cities in India adhere to Euro IV fuel norms while the rest of the country is on Euro III./Heavy duty vehicles from other states plying via Delhi use Euro III fuel which adds to the capital's pollution burden. After Delhi's alarmingly poor air quality made headlines this year and World Health Organization (WHO)ranked it first among the 1,600 most polluted cities, research and civil society groups have been demanding India move to Euro VI fuel norms./Since the National Green Tribunal (NGT) outlawed vehicles in Delhi that are over 15 years old in a bid to curb air pollution, no move has been made to implement the ban. One of ICCT's recommendations is also a scrappage programme for heavy duty commercial vehicles, which may address the automobile industry's concerns about the impact of implementing Euro VI on vehicle sales./In a recent affidavit in Supreme Court, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers has claimed it cannot produce Euro V-compliant vehicles until 2020-2021 and has not committed to any deadline regarding manufacture of Euro VI-compliant ones./ICCT has suggested implementing a five-year programme (2020-2024) to scrap older commercial vehicles and buses which will allow owners to gradually adjust to higher vehicle costs while reaping air-quality benefits. Heavy duty vehicle owners can get a subsidy to replace their older, still-operational, Bharat I, II or III vehicle with a new Bharat VI vehicle at the price of a Bharat V-equivalent./However, such a programme will only benefit the auto industry, environmentalist Sunita Narain says. ""Very stringent on-road inspection to ensure that polluting vehicles are phased out can have the same impact. Almost every vehicle passes through pollution check. The automobile industry will obviously love a scrappage policy, but I think we can manage with on-road enforcement,"" she said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Cancer cases may double in 5 yrs',"KOLKATA: Kolkata's poisoned air is sending the city hurtling towards a health disaster, fear experts. The number of cancer patients and neurological ailments will double in five years unless harmful emissions like sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides and respirable dust particles are checked immediately, they warn./A study of the city's cancer patients reveals that many of them have undergone tissue erosion, alterations and gene mutation, say doctors. ""This is a direct result of continued exposure to polluted air. It could take up to 40 years to acquire these changes, but it's happening. A large number of lung cancer cases, especially among women, can be traced back to pollution,"" said Subir Ganguly, oncologist./Pollution was one of the reasons for the spiraling number of lung, larynx and oesophagal cancer cases, said Joydeep Biswas, director of Chittaranjan National Cancer Research Institute. ""Pollution is not the only reason, but definitely a major one. It can be concluded from the fact that a large number of women in Kolkata contract lung cancer. Smoking can be a major trigger for men, but it's certainly not so for the women of this city,"" said Biswas./He added that he was not surprised by the findings of the TOI-SAFE survey. ""Oxides of sulfur and nitrogen are obviously high at the busy intersections. What's more alarming, the harmful emission count is rising every year with hardly any measure being taken to check it. This way, the number of lung cancer patients will rise exponentially in Kolkata,"" said Biswas./Harmful oxides and hydrocarbons emitted by vehicles directly hit the lungs, larynx and oesophagus, said noted oncologist Gautam Mukhopadhyay. ""There is no doubt that pollution is responsible for a chunk of these cancer cases in Kolkata. We often come across patients who live near polluted intersections and have been exposed to harmful emission for decades,"" he said./Air pollution could also lead to neurological disorders, including deterioration of the brain's cognitive functions. Hrishikesh Kumar, head of neurology at Institute of Neurosciences, attributes the rise in Parkinson's, dementia and motor neuron diseases to the city's pollution levels. ""Harmful chemicals are a major reason for neurological ailments. Sulfur and nitrogen oxides enter the bloodstream through the lungs and reach the brain. They interact with important proteins and amino acids and produce a waste substance that leads to Parkinson's or dementia,"" said Kumar, warning that pollution could also trigger epileptic fits and seizures./Just a few months of exposure could be enough to trigger changes in brain, said Kumar.

Smoke spewers duck green law but no one stops them,"KOLKATA: Strict emission standard but lenient enforcement is what marks the city's approach to pollution control. More than 75% of vehicles you see at any given time have ducked the mandatory pollution control test. ""If vehicles are not maintained and tuned, they are bound to pollute, however higher emission standard they comply,"" said Sudipta Bhattacharya, head of SAFE./The state government has banned commercial vehicles older than 15 years from the Kolkata metropolitan area. Autos have switched to LPG. And after April 2010, only Bharat Stage-IV vehicles are registered in the city. Yet, there is no noticeable improvement in the air quality. The pollution parameters still remains are 20% to 50% higher than safe limits at many parts of the city./""Apart from dust generated from construction activity, vehicular pollution contributes the maximum to air pollution. If air quality progressively declines, it means vehicles are not adhering to emission norms. It is evident that a large section of vehicles plying in the city have either not been tested or have fudged test results,"" said Subhas Datta./The reason is that only 24% vehicles are actually turning up for the pollution-under-control (PUC) certificate. There has been hardly any enforcement since the initial days of the ban on 15-year-old commercial vehicles in 2008-09. What makes it worse is that many of the auto emission testing centres (AETC) have not been properly calibrated. So a clean chit from them may not necessarily mean a green chit. ""With no enforcement in vogue, the urgency for getting a PUC certificate has somehow been lost,"" said an emission tester./Unlike Mumbai and Delhi, where renewal of PUC is a quarterly affair, in Kolkata it is bi-annual. Moreover, out of 59 AETCs in the state, 47 are in Kolkata, North-24 Parganas has six, Howrah has four and Hooghly and Nadia has one each. South 24-Parganas has none./According to the Auto Emission Testers' Association in Bengal, only 24% of the city's vehicular population turn up for the half-yearly check. ""A majority of vehicles go unchecked and continue to pollute the city, putting a big question mark on the relevance of the stringent emission standards,"" said association general secretary A Palchowdhury./""The government seems to have forgotten the basics. If people do not follow a law, it does make any difference if you have stringent or lax rules. The government has failed miserably in enforcement of pollution rules,"" said a tester./It is the responsibility of the transport department to enforce the law. The penalty for the first offence of not having a PUC clearance is Rs 1,800. The second time, the registration of the vehicle can be suspended for 15 days and if the owner fails a third time, the registration may be cancelled for life. But there is no system yet to check for repeat offences. So, even the few that are caught get off with a Rs 1,800 fine./""We do not have enough inspectors for raids. The pollution control board is supposed to check if the AETCs are functioning properly,"" an official of the public vehicles department said. Experts say that introduction of smart cards would lead to better monitoring. The moment a vehicle undergoes an emission test, the smart card would record it, which would show up in the PVD database. It will be easier to identify errant vehicles and repeat offenders./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Kolkata air quality fails safety test,"KOLKATA: The city has always been polluted but the rate at which its level is increasing has turned menacing. A series of tests of ambient air quality at five crossings - carried out by TOI in association with Saviors and Friends of Environment (SAFE) last week - has found some startling facts. It calls for greater monitoring and stringent enforcement against polluting vehicles./Fine particulates and nitrogen oxides dominate the list of major pollutants in the city air. The annual average of PM10 - fine particulate matter that invades the lungs and triggers respiratory diseases and cancer - has been around 1.5 times, or even more, the national limit. The annual average of nitrogen oxides is also above the limit, test results revealed./""The particulate pollution in winter is generally twice or even higher than the national standard. But we are getting the same reading in spring, when the pollution level goes down due to weather conditions. This is something to worry about. It shows the vehicular pollution goes rather unchecked,"" said Sudipta Bhattacharya, an environmentalist and head of SAFE./Even more dangerous is the presence of finer particulates PM2.5 that constitutes around 75% of the total respirable particulate matter in the air. ""Though we have not measured it, the high level of PM10 also indicates high level of PM2.5. The PM2.5 count by the American Consulate also shows the alarming state of the ambient air,"" he added./But monitoring of ambient air has got a beating with the number of air quality monitoring stations declining from 17 to 11. Of these, only two automated stations - at Victoria Memorial Hall and Rabindra Bharati University - take readings 24 X 7. The other nine manual stations at Ultadanga, Moulali, Baishnabghata, Salt Lake, Minto Park, Paribesh Bhawan, Dunlop Bridge, Shyambazar and Behala Chowrasta are operated only twice a week./""Despite a court order directing all air quality monitoring stations be in operation, the pollution board continues to keep most of the stations shut for a major part of the week. Moreover, with numbers being reduced, fewer parts of the city's air is being monitored. With no data, there is no warning to citizens who are breathing the toxic fumes,"" said legal activist Subhas Datta, whose petition on air pollution led to the court directive./PCB chairman Kalyan Rudra acknowledges the need for more monitoring stations to cover a larger section of the city but points to two eternal hurdles: manpower and funds. ""We are trying to get around the stumbling blocks and widen coverage,"" he said. In fact, SAFE readings echo the central pollution control board study which finds greater Kolkata as the topper in nitrogen-oxide pollution. On certain days, the presence of these pollutants spikes twice, putting the air we breathe in the category of ""extremely critical""./A closer scrutiny of the study revealed that pollution level becomes quite unbearable where the Metro corridor is being constructed. In Ruby and Behala Chowrasta, where an elevated Metro corridor is under construction, the level of particulate matter is quite high. Particularly at Behala Chowrasta, the particulate matter is 3.5 times the national standard./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Citizens fume over garbage burning, cite health concerns","PUNE: Toxic clouds of smoke are hanging over the city with people and the civic staff continuing to burn garbage in the open, paying no heed to warnings of health experts or even the civic administration./The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is struggling to collect and process dry garbage in the city as the two major processing plants have broken down, which has resulted in garbage piles accumulating across the city./The head of PMC's solid waste department, Suresh Jagtap, said that the administration has warned against garbage burning and would take action if the civic staff was involved in it. However, citizens have written to the municipal commissioner pointing out that the civic staff, mainly those who sweep and collect the waste including garden waste, and local people are burning garbage in all parts of the city./The open burning of waste by the PMC itself is in violation of its own duties to prevent the deterioration of ambient air quality in the city, citizens have pointed out./""Over the past few weeks, we have witnessed a steady deterioration in the quality of air, which can be attributed to the rampant burning of garbage all around. Since dry garbage pickup by PMC is irregular, several housing societies all over Pune have resorted to burning solid waste which, at times, includes rubber and plastics. Despite repeated complaints, the PMC authorities have failed to stop this practice,"" said Satish Khot of National Society for Clean Cities (NSCC)./Burning of biomass and solid waste is a punishable criminal offence under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 that authorizes state governments to ban burning of any material if it is likely to cause air pollution and thus must be dealt with strictly./""Indiscriminate dumping of all kinds of waste material by the roadside, wet and dry waste, rubber tyres, plastic sheets, rubble and other discarded household items, which are not cleared every day, are set on fire by PMC sanitary sweepers. Sanitary inspectors of wards are never to be seen, sometimes they even switch off their mobiles,"" said Ann Delorme, a Dhanori resident, adding there is a black cloud of smoke and foul odour from the piles of burning garbage./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
86% 'bad air' days in Delhi this winter,"NEW DELHI: Delhiites could be inhaling a cocktail of toxins all through winter, with 'good air' days few and far between. A data analysis reveals that air quality in the capital this winter was poor or worse on 86% of days, showing deterioration over the previous two years./The three-year analysis of air quality during October to February showed that 'good air' days - when the AQI is either good or moderate - had also declined from 19% and 22% in the previous two years to 14% in 2014-15./The analysis was conducted by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) under Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES). It found that AQI in 76% of the winter days in 2014-15 was in the 'poor' category compared to 67% and 54% in the preceding years./Only relief this winter came in the form of a dip in the number of severely polluted days, which fell to 3% from 16% (in 2012-13) to 6% (2013-14). Severely polluted days, when the AQI is 250 or higher, are often determined by weather conditions./The figures are based on data from 10 monitoring stations in NCR. If the same levels occurred in the US, the 'poor' days would be considered 'very unhealthy'. Similarly, the 7% of days when Delhi air was in the 'very poor' category would have triggered 'health warnings of emergency conditions' under the US index./""We found that 2014 has been unusually bad. What is worrying is the data indicates that the annual average didn't change much but the frequency of 'poor' days increased significantly,"" said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune./Neighbouring Noida's air quality this winter seems to have been even worse. It recorded 33% 'severe' days and 46% 'poor' days, compared to 7% severe and 58% poor days in 2013-14./SAFAR has categorized each day's PM2.5 (fine, respirable particles) level under five heads: good, moderate, poor, very poor and severe as per the air quality index (AQI). The concentration range of PM2.5 in the 'poor' category is 90-210 micrograms per cubic metre while the safe standard is 60./This week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch AQI for 10 cities, including Delhi, under Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC). An hourly AQI will available on the ministry's website./So many poor-air-quality days usually call for health precautions such as minimizing physical and outdoor activities of vulnerable people such as the old and those with cardiac or respiratory conditions. But in the absence of a health advisory for air pollution in India, many may not even have known about the bad quality./""Those with heart disease, COPD, asthma or allergies suffer a lot during poor-air-quality days. Those with heart disease can even collapse. Use of drugs increases, which has its own side effects,"" said Dr T K Joshi, director, Centre for Environment Occupational and Health (CEOH)./Recently, Joshi has recommended to the Delhi government that a health advisory be issued and a special prevention strategy be prepared for schools. ""The class teacher should monitor PM10 (coarse pollutants) and PM2.5 regularly. Children's physical activity should be restricted if there is severe or very-poor air quality,"" he suggested./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Nitrogen oxide levels in city air worry environmental experts,"MUMBAI: The dust storm in the Arabian peninsula has resulted in Mumbai topping the list of India's most polluted cities. According to experts, the haze over the city most possibly contained PM2.5./Although air pollution is an issue in Mumbai, its levels have dropped since leaded petrol was banned about two decades ago. Levels of carcinogenic sulphur dioxide have reduced to 7 in suburbs like Bandra, as per Maharashtra Pollution Control Board charts./The readings for PM2.5 are usually below the danger mark of 100 in the city except Sion, where the average reading for March stood at 134.79. But levels of nitrogen oxides, responsible for smog as well as acid rain, have been worryingly high in the city. The perception among experts is that Mumbai is not dangerously polluted. ""The dust haze was worse on Sunday than on Monday. It will settle down soon,"" said Dr Rakesh Kumar of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, or Neeri. Dr Ashok Mahasur, chest specialist with Hinduja Hospital, Mahim, said, ""This dust haze contained natural particles and not chemicals.

The index, using continuous 24-hour average data, will be made available daily from various monitoring stations in those cities./The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has developed the index in consultation with IIT, Kanpur and other expert groups comprising medical professionals and scientists./The move, which will not only enhance public awareness but also create a competitive environment among cities to take steps for air pollution mitigation, was welcomed by environmentalists and think-tanks. They however, said the government should also implement pollution emergency measures to bring down peak pollution levels in the same manner as is being done in other countries./""For the first time, the government has taken the initiative to inform people about daily air quality with simple descriptions that people can understand. It is cautioning them about possible health consequences. This can help build public awareness as well as public support for hard decisions needed to get cleaner air,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of Delhi-based research and policy group Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)./Under the AQI, hosted on CPCB's website, air pollution levels have been classified in six bands with simple descriptions to help people understand it.

"Now, a live and online guide to city's air pollution","CHENNAI: With the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change launching an online national air quality index (AQI), important parameters like particle pollution (PM 2.5) levels, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide for three centres -- Manali, IIT and Alandur -- will be available on a daily basis./Those who wish to know the level of air pollution in their neighbourhood will now be able to get the data at the click of a mouse. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the initiative on Monday. The data is available for Chennai from March 25 onwards at . The idea behind the launch of online data is for people to change the lifestyle by looking at the AQI of their neighbourhoods./Everyday, the site will show maximum, minimum and average levels for all the four pollutants. In the coming days, other pollutants like particulate matter up to 10 micrometre, Ozone, ammonia and lead levels will also be displayed./All indicators are classified as good, satisfactory, moderately polluted, poor, very poor and severe and are given colour codes for people to understand. The site also gives a possible health impact for each of these categories. For example, good has minimal impact, while moderate would make breathing uncomfortable for people with asthma and heart and lung diseases. If the locality is marked severe, it would affect even healthy people./Though data from the site is inconsistent, Chennai does not seem to be doing well as per the data provided. Last Wednesday, the AQI in Manali, an industrial hub was 237 and was classified as poor. Alandur, which is residential area, got an AQI of 88, which was classified as good.

Sahibabad units polluting Delhi too: UPPCB official,"GHAZIABAD: Smoke billowing out of the chimneys of the industrial units in the Sahibabad Site IV industrial area are not only triggering respiratory problems in trans-Hindon colonies of Ghaziabad, but they are also causing air pollution in the neighbouring areas of Delhi such as Anand Vihar, Vivek Vihar and Yojana Vihar./A study in Site IV industrial area has shown air pollution level to be very high./Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board's trans-Hindon area chief R S Singh said the respirable particulate matter or RSPM (PM10) measured in the site IV industrial area in February was a whopping 293 microgram per cubic metre, as opposed to the permissible limit of 100. The suspended particulate matter was 569 mcg against the maximum permissible limit of 100, he told TOI./When asked as to why no action is being taken against the polluting industries, Singh said, ""It does not always happen that way. The workers usually put in too much fuel while starting the furnaces. That causes the dense smoke from the chimneys to immediately become visible. But, we will look into the complaints that we are receiving about air pollution.""/However, he agreed that much of the air pollution from the industrial units makes its way into Delhi and Noida, as Delhi's does into Ghaziabad and Noida./Doctors also said the industrial pollution has been triggering respiratory diseases among residents./""There has been a rise in the number of patients suffering from diseases caused by respiratory irritants. Air pollution definitely plays a large part in it.

Order to keep agencies on their toes,"NEW DELHI: NGT's order on prevention of dust pollution implies that civic agencies and departments such as PWD, DJB and DDA will have to strictly follow the rules. From now onwards, no construction material will be allowed to be dumped on the roadside. Besides, construction sites or places where such material is stored have to be barricaded properly to prevent formation of dust./Other than Delhi Metro, which has so far been quite particular about barricading construction sites, all others have never bothered about ensuring either safety at site or controlling dust pollution. In fact, material like sand and cement is often stored along the roads, without any protective cover. During digging work, where agencies such as DJB, municipal corporations and discoms are involved, mud and other waste material are piled along the work site and left in the open. In summer months, when a dry wind blows in the city, incidents of dust haze have become extremely common./In the elaborate order on control of dust-related air pollution, Swatanter Kumar, NGT chairperson, said: ""No person can be permitted to store sand or other material on the streets. Wherever it is stored, it has to be fully covered to prevent dispersal of dust. With regard to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, its public benefit and importance cannot be denied but it is also required to take measures to ensure that there is no dust pollution during its work.""/Any project, including the private building work, will be stopped if it violates the NGT rules or the 2010 MoEF guidelines. ""The rules laid down by NGT on Friday have already been mentioned in the 2010 MoEF guidelines. The NGT order makes the guidelines mandatory,"" said a source./At present, the municipal corporation is in charge of penalizing those who leave construction waste or material lying about on the road or footpath. However, penal action is rarely taken. In fact, with government agencies defaulting themselves, there is no question of action being taken. Sources said that often construction material is thrown on the roadside and it becomes impossible to trace it back to the owner./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Improve air to better kids' lung function,"NEW DELHI: When we read about Delhi being the most polluted city in the world, many of us are horrified. We worry about the damage being done by pollutants to our children's health-if it can ever be undone. Well, the United States has managed to do just that./A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows how government action to curb pollution in Southern California from 1994 to 2011 has helped improve children's lung function./The researchers tracked lung function of children from public schools in five most polluted locations in Southern California-Long Beach, Mira Loma, Riverside, San Dimas and Upland. They took repeated measurements of the children's ability to breathe as they grew from the age of 11 to 15 years./The results show that, as air quality improved, the number of children with abnormally low lung function fell by over 4%-from 7.9% (1994-1998) to 6.3% (1997-2001) and 3.6% (2007-2011). The lung growth of the subjects got better by over 10% during the study period./""Till date, we only conjectured that pollution impacts lung function of healthy people. This study provides clinching evidence. But, on the brighter side, it gives us hope that the crisis can be overcome by adopting stringent measures,"" said Dr Arup Basu, chest specialist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Southern California faced acute crisis on account of air pollution in the 1980s, thanks to a large motor vehicles feet and industries./""The local government came up with strong laws-still the world's most stringent. It adopted the first coordinated air pollution control programme. Their vehicles are well-maintained and best quality fuel is used... In California, even 40 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic metre is considered hazardous, but average presence of such pollutants in Delhi is 150-200 micrograms,"" said Dr Sundeep Salvi, director of the Pune-based Chest Research Foundation./The number of motor vehicles in India, a major contributor to air pollution, has gone up from 37.2 million in 1997 to over 100 million.

'Rising air pollution affecting festival of rays',"KOLHAPUR: Veteran scientist R V Bhosale has claimed that environmental changes and increasing air pollution might be the major obstacles to the festival of rays at the Mahalaxmi temple./During the biannual festival, sun rays fall at the feet and face of goddess Mahalaxmi's idol and thousands of devotees throng the temple to witness the spectacle. However, during the recent festivals in November 2014 and February this year, the rays failed to reach to the face of the deity's idol./Bhosale (85), an astronomist, studied the behaviour of rays in the last two months, referred to earlier records of the festival and presented his conclusions before the public. The thousand-year-old temple was constructed in such a way that on November 23 & 25, January 31 and February 1 & 2, the rays of the setting sun used to glide from the idol's feet to face./""There have been studies about the physical obstacles; some of them have bee removed now. However, there wasn't any astronomical study available regarding the festival. Rays travel through the atmosphere and are refracted when they pass through the atmospheric prism. In the case of this festival, an artificial prism of polluted air, vapour, smoke and dust particles are causing refraction of rays. Hence, the rays cannot reach the idol's face,"" Bhosale said./For the study, Bhosale presented a hypothesis considering the fact that the idol is of 1 mt and its distance from the horizon is 10 km. ""We found in our study that the rays are getting refracted and failing to reach the idol's face. During this specific season, the activities of sugar factories and farmers are at their peak which increases air pollution. Besides, rapid urbanization also pollutes the air. The rays bent when they pass through this atmospheric prism,"" Bhosale said./The research was conducted by Mass Initiative for Truth, Research and Action (MITRA), an NGO working in the environmental sector. Bhosale was assisted by S B Pawar, Uday Gaikwad and others./""This study is significant since for the first time, we are talking about the environmental impact on the festival. In 2006-07, we studied the physical obstacles such as buildings, banners and hoardings. During the last 8-10 years, most of the obstacles were removed barring buildings. However, the rays were unable to reach the idol's face. Now, it seems that we have solved the puzzle. The government must consider this research and take action accordingly. If the air gets more polluted, we may miss the festival of rays permanently,"" Gaikwad told TOI./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Dust and vehicular smoke choking Kanpur, says UPPCB","KANPUR: Muddy roads and vehicular smoke has made the city's air poisonous. Air quality in the city has deteriorated to hazardous level with level of particulate matter increasing to three times of its permissible limit./Doctors say such a poor air quality has triggered respiratory problems among the people with low immunity, the elderly and the young ones. UP Pollution Control Board's (UPPCB's) real time air quality monitoring system showed the 24-hour average count to be over 324 micrograms per cubic metre on Brahmanagar area alone on Sunday. This is three times more of the permissible limit of 100 micrograms per cubic metre./The data collected from the regional UPPCB office shows that concentration of PM10 in the air has thrice its permissible limit in the past few days. UPPCB's real time air quality monitoring system is installed in Brahmanagar area, which is away from industrial activity. The increase in value of PM10 is clearly due to city-based activities./Regional officer, Pollution Control Board, T U Khan, said that uncontrolled activities at construction sites and increasing vehicles in the city have given way to the number of PM10 here./PM10 refers to fine suspended particulates less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10) that are capable of penetrating deep into the respiratory tract and causing significant health damage. PM10 are so small that they can get into the lungs, potentially causing serious health problems. Ten micrometers is smaller than the width of a single human hair./""With increase in temperature, the concentration of dust particles in the air increases. Particulate matter does not settle on the surface and blows away in the air when temperature is high. Digging of roads all over the city has resulted in rise in PM10 level. Also, vehicular pressure increases on roads during summers which is also one of the contributing factors,"" he said./Doctors say that constant exposure to bad air is making Kanpurities vulnerable to chronic respiratory disorders like asthma and bronchitis. Dr. Sudhir Chaudhary, pulmunologist in GSVM medical college said that continuous exposure to high air pollution levels is like being exposed to second hand smoke./""Fine particulate matter and gaseous pollutants are significant risk factors for asthma. Kids and the elderly are most susceptible to the effects of these fine particulate air pollutants. The risk of respiratory disorders increases during summers when the climate is dry with nearly zero humidity. The number of respiratory disorder patients in the city have increased by 20 per cent in the last five years,"" he said./Dr. Anand Kumar, director, Murari Lal Chest Hospital, LLR, said that air pollution combined with an unbalanced lifestyle has contributed to rising cases of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in the city./""The actual cause of the disease is not known, but the precipitating factors are air pollution and smoking. About 50-60% patients we deal in OPD are COPD sufferers, which is an alarming situation in the city,"" he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution may cause stroke: Study,"NEW DELHI: Air pollution which is known to cause poor lung and heart health may also cause a stroke, a new research suggests./The findings of the research, which has been published in British Medical Journal, are based on an analysis of 103 studies, involving 6.2 million hospitalizations and deaths because of stroke in 28 countries./TOI spoke to India's top neurologists who said it was possible. ""At AIIMS also, we have initiated a study to analyze the link between air pollution and stroke,"" said Dr Kameshwar Prasad, professor and head of the neurology department. He added that there has been a significant increase in stroke cases in the country which cannot be explained by unhealthy lifestyle and other identified risk factors alone./Dr Shakir Hussain, chairman of Stroke & Neurointervention Foundation, said more than 50% of the stroke patients that he sees are below 45 years of age. ""Of them, some are non-smokers, who have normal blood pressure and do not have diabetes. The role of environmental factors in triggering neural disorders cannot be ruled out in such cases. It requires detailed investigation,"" he said./The doctors say vehicular emissions include ultrafine particles and gases such as carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide which get into the bloodstream. ""The pollutants cause thickening of the blood and also initiate formation of cytokines which trigger stroke,"" said Prasad./The AIIMS study, he added, would involve assessing the date and time of stroke in admitted patients and the level of air pollution in their localities./""Several studies conducted in other parts of the world, including the recent one from British Medical Journal, clearly show strong association between incidence of strokes and air pollution. In India, the pollution levels in cities are very high and if our study reveals a similar association then we would urge the government to take action,"" said Prasad./He said role of pollutants is more prominent in ischaemic stroke cases in which the blood vessels supplying oxygenated blood to the brain get blocked. It constitutes nearly 85% of all stroke cases. The rest are haemorrhagic stroke cases, in which bleeding from a damaged blood vessel in or around the brain damages or puts pressure on the brain tissue./""In western countries, even 40 microgram per cubic metre of particulate matter is considered hazardous but the average presence of such pollutants in Delhi ranges from 150-200 microgram per cubic metre,"" said Dr Sundeep Salvi, director of Chest Research Foundation./Recently, National Green Tribunal banned all diesel-run vehicles over 10 years old in Delhi./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Fake emission certificates pollute the air,"<a href=""mailto:Aparajita.Ray@timesgroup.com"">Aparajita.Ray@timesgroup.com</a>/Bengaluru: Ever wondered why the air pollution level in the city is high even though every other vehicle seems to have an emission certificate and the RTO regularly conducts checks on roads? The answer is many vehicles may be having fake certificates stating that they spout less smoke./The transport department recently cancelled licences of seven emission test centres in the city for issuing bogus certificates. This may be just the tip of an iceberg./TOI has learnt how vehicle owners get fake emission certificates by paying just a few hundred rupees. At the emission testing centre, when the measurement shows that a vehicle spouts smoke above the permissible limit, the staff there issues a fake certificate for a price./The staffer takes a photo of the vehicle registration plate and inserts a tube into the silencer to measure the emission of smoke. After a deal, he copies the reading of some other vehicle on the certificate and issues it to the ""customer"". The faker certificate claims that a vehicle emits smoke, but it's under the permissible limit./Explaining how the racket operates, Chandrasekhar A, who runs an emission testing centre on Double Road, said, ""When a vehicle owner is in a hurry, these people who run such centres copy someone else's reading on a different file and print it out for the customer. In such cases, the customer does not know how he got a fake certificate. He gets trapped in the vicious circle of emission racketeers and ends up paying penalty later.""/Besides, certificates can also be fudged. Although Chandrashekar says that machines cannot be tampered with because they are coded and monitored by the department on a real-time basis, there are other possibilities. The emission testing machines have a validity of about five years, but some centres us them beyond that, which can lead to faulty readings./When the Karnataka high court recently pulled up the pollution control board and the transport department for failing to contain air pollution, the latter pointed to the shoddy manner in which emission certificates are doled out to vehicle owners./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
