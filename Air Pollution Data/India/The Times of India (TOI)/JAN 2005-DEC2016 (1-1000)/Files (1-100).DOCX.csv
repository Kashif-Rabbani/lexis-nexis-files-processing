"Defying law, smoking continues unchecked at public places","KANPUR: Are norms regarding smoking in public places being complied with? Not if one went by the findings of non-governmental organisations. Their survey report finds that around 50 per cent of bars and restaurants are not complying with smoke-free laws. The survey was conducted in 211 indoor places in 16 cities of 12 states. It was found that smoking was taking place in 127 out of the 211 places covered during the study period./Level of fine particles in places where smoking was observed was found to be 32 times higher than the World Health Organisation air quality guideline for particulate matter in indoor places./At a district-level advocacy workshop on tobacco control organised on Saturday in association with district tobacco control cell, Kanpur, and NGOs from Lucknow and New Delhi to generate awareness on health hazards due to passive smoking, the data presented a clear picture on how the norms were being flouted./Ashish Pandey, one of the members of the NGO from New Delhi, informed that the study demonstrated gross violation of smoke-free laws in India and provided evidence that indoor smoking caused exposure to harmful levels of air pollution./He said: ""The most alarming finding of the study is that cumulative indoor pollution level in public places across India is 324 micro gram per cubic metre which is much beyond the hazardous category of (251) micro gram per cubic metre of Air Quality Index (AQI). Therefore, non-smokers exposed to smoke at these places are at greater risk of a wide range of adverse health effects including heart attack and lung cancer.""/In Lucknow, 20 public places were visited, out of which smoking was observed at 12 such places. Similarly Kerala recorded maximum number indoor places where smoking was going on without any prohibition. Notably, out of 33 such places, smoking was going on fearlessly at 29. However, in Ahmedabad (Gujarat), only three places abided by the smoke-free laws out of 20 bars and restaurants./Moreover, at the 129 places 'No Smoking' signage was absent and smoking was taking place even at places where signages were present. It was also found that out of 45 non-smoking places, only at 28 places ashtrays were present. Notably, only four locations had designated smoking rooms but none of them were as per the guidelines of the smoke-free law./According to the law which was approved in May 2008 and came into effect on October 2, 2008 for individuals not abiding by the law, a fine of Rs 200 will be issued per violation and the individual will be subject to possible criminal sanction./The workshop, which was attended by chief medical officer (CMO) Ashok Mishra, nodal officers of the district tobacco control cell, officials from the health department and various government officials also were made aware of the fact that designated smoke room (DSR) provision of the law was being ignored. JP Sharma, executive director of the NGO, mentioned that no public policy allowing the DSRs had ever been demonstrated to eliminate the hazards of passive smoking./He appealed to government officials to modify the smoke-free law and told them to intensify the enforcement drive in public and private sectors to implement Cigarette and Other Tobacco Prevention Act (COTPA) 2003 effectively./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Guangzhou battles bad air quality ahead of Asian Games,"BEIJING: The battle against ""bad air"" quality that authorities fought before the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games is now repeated in the south China city of Guangzhou, which is hosting the Asian Games in November.

Kanpur to be one of the most polluted cities in the country,"KANPUR: ""There are nearly 65 cities and towns in the country wherein the air pollution has reached a dangerous level. The list includes cities like Kanpur, Lucknow, Govindgarh (Punjab) and others./In Kanpur alone, the PM-10 (a fine particulate matter found in air) is 200 times more than the standard which stands at 60 micrograms,"" The vehicles largely contribute to the ever-increasing air pollution which is really a cause of concern"", said B Sengupta, ex-secretary, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) while talking to TOI during his visit to IIT-Kanpur on Tuesday. He was here to take part in the three day-long international conference on Environmental Health and Technology./Ironically, Kanpur has once again found its name in the list of the cities having alarmingly high air pollution level. And the reasons accounted were the emission of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and other harmful gases./Explaining about the damage caused to the human body by PM-10 emitted in the air, Sengupta said: ""The particulate PM-10 directly enters into the human lungs and harms the body leading to heart attack, blood pressure disease and diseases of respiratory tract. Therefore, at all such places where the PM-10 is several times higher than the requisite standards, the air pollution is becoming bane for human beings.""/He further went on to add that the emission of hydrocarbons, oxides and nitrogen are also harmful for the environment. ""When hydrocarbons, oxide and nitrogen react in the air, an ozone layer is formed. This ozone (a pollutant) is both harmful to human health and agriculture.""/While speaking about the amount of sewage left untreated in the country that causes water pollution, Sengupta said: ""A total of 33,000 MLD sewage is generated in the country out of which only 7,000 MLD sewage is treated in the sewage treatment plants. The remaining is drained out in the rivers. Therefore, it can be imagined that what a large quantity of waste is directly flown into rivers, harming our rivers to the worst."" We are short of sewage treatment plants which should be commissioned in large numbers to handle the menace otherwise the situation will be very grave, he added./Giving similar data about the amount of hazardous waste which is left untreated, Sengupta said eight million tonnes of hazardous waste is generated in the country and only 10 lakh tonnes is treated. The remaining is illegally dumped that adds to the pollution both on the land surface and in the water./Suggesting reasons as to how the menace can be curbed, the ex-CPCB chief maintained that several norms made by the government should be implemented for securing better results. The shortage of skilled man-power in the state pollution boards and the lack of commitment on their part is another big reason for the tremendous growth of pollution, despite the efforts, concluded Sengupta./* The safe level of fine particulate matter (PM-10) is 60 micrograms but if it exceeds the requisite standard, the situation can become alarming./* The level of PM-10 in the city is 200 times more than the standard./* A total of 33,000 MLD of sewage is generated in the country. With the present capacity of the sewage treatment plants to treat only 7,000 MLD of sewage, the remaining is directly drained into the rivers causing water pollution./* Similarly, out of the eight million tonnes of hazardous waste generated in the country, only 10 lakh tonnes is treated.

"MC violates own rules, burns leaves","LUDHIANA: At a time when its solid waste management project is hanging fire, it seems that municipal corporation has found a simple way to get rid of dry leaves and garbage. Employees could be seen burning the piles of dry leaves along the roadside in the open instead of allowing these to turn into compost in a park or under a tree or on a vacant plot, violating the ban imposed by the civic body itself./A municipal staff said in such dry and hot weather, even a spark could prove dangerous. The smoke emanating from rubbish is a major health hazard and could cause severe skin and respiratory problems, besides irritation in the eye, nose and throat. There is no vigil on the activities of sanitary employees, who set fire to the leaves and create pollution, he stated./Describing the MC attitude, a shopkeeper on Mall Road, Sahil, said, ""We have lodged several complaints with the department against the activity indulged in by the employees but in vain.""/Zonal commissioner (zone D) PS Ghuman brushed aside the information that MC staffers might resort to such activities. But on being quizzed further, said he would look into the matter. ""It is only during morning hours when there is slight relief from air pollution due to vehicular traffic. But the burning of leaves pollute the atmosphere and create health hazard especially for joggers. Hence, the authorities should check these practises,"" he asserted./Sources said since the burning of leaves generates carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and organic matters, it might lead to serious repercussions in people who suffer from cardiovascular disease and also increase respiratory illness in children. This activity also reduces visibility and damages property./This practice is an usual affair on Mall Road, Club Road, Vishkarma Chowk, Civil Lines and Tagore Nagar./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Dust storm: Tips to stay fit and fine,"VARANASI: While most parts of the city are fast turning into dust zones increasing health hazard risks, the experts of chest and respiratory diseases are coming up with health tips and preventive measures to cut down these risks./Dr JK Samaria department of Chest and Respiratory Diseases Banaras Hindu University said: ""The increasing concentration of dust and smokes from the vehicles could definitely increase the particulate matter (PM) in the air, enough to aggravate the respiratory diseases."" The patients witnessing chronic cases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) need to be extra careful and cover their faces with clothes to avoid the situation, he added./It is to be mentioned here that particulate matters are tiny particles of solid or liquid suspended in a gas (air). Some particulates occur naturally originating from dust storms and others result from human activities like burning of fossil fuel in vehicles./While the health experts opine that the increased levels of fine particles in the air are linked to health hazards such as heart disease, altered lung function and even lung cancer, they also believe that chronic patients of cardiopulmonary diseases must avoid these conditions to remain indoors./""There are persistent free radicals connected to airborne fine particles that could cause cardiopulmonary disease and even odours from the garbage (dumped near roads) and sewage along with dust can raise their level,"" said Dr Samaria. One should allow proper ventilation to get rid of indoor air pollution which is more dangerous. The chronic patients especially the elderly people should never miss the puffs that dilate the breathing pipe, he added./Important health tips to avoid dust storms/# Cover your body especially facial area with handkerchief or cloth to prevent inhalation of smoke and dust/# Use helmets or other gears including masks to avoid these conditions/# Try alternative routes to avoid dusty, choked or congested roads/# Wash your body parts (facial areas) and clothes regularly and maintain good personal hygiene/# Asthamatic or COPD patients should strictly adhere to medicines and avoid going out in these conditions/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"NSI takes the lead, KU follows to protect environment","KANPUR: Taking the initiative, National Sugar Institute (NSI) chooses to go the eco-friendly way. The institute now decomposes its waste especially the dried leaves and bushes instead of directly burning it./To combat against the pollution level and protect the environment from harmful gases, at least near by Kalyanpur, where the institute is situated, NSI took the step a month ago. NSI director Prof SK Mitra said: ""The dried leaves and bushes form a major part of the waste in the institute that was earlier burnt causing air pollution. Now, the dry leaves and other decomposable waste is converted to compost.""/He went on to add: ""On an average, over 200-300 kilograms of dried leaves and waste was earlier burnt everyday. In turn, the smoke clouds that were formed enveloped the campus and also contributed to high levels of air pollution. In addition, burning of non-degradable waste like plastic led to the toxic gases like nitrogen oxide and carbon oxide into the atmosphere. Due to this, we had decided to convert these leaves into compost.""/The institute comprises of 126 quarters, three student hostels accommodating nearly 300 students. Together, the place generated about a tonne of garbage waste, claimed the officials. Besides, the vegetation waste also added up the pollution levels./""The initiative would serve dual advantages -- the air pollution caused due to the burning of leaves will be stopped and the manure will be prepared for the plants in the institute itself which will in turn save our expenses that we spent on buying the fertilisers,"" said the director./Explaining the process, Mitra said: "" Two pits, more than five feet deep are being dug and from past one month, the dried leaves and bushes are dumped into them. In addition, a huge unused water entrenchment near the student hostel would also be used in collecting the waste,"" adding that ""we are hopeful that a small effort by us would certainly reap positive and environment friendly results.""/Besides, the attention is paid towards the fact that only the bio-degradable waste are put into these trenches, separating the plastic and other non-biodegradable items from the decomposable effluent, said the officials./It is to mentioned here that apart from NSI, the Kanpur University too has been involved in converting the dried leaves (on the campus) to bacterial compost./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
City's air quality `dangerous',"PATNA: Patnaites are breathing polluted air, the quality of which has reached dangerous levels./""The children are the worst-hit with pollution-related diseases like asthma, dysentery and diarrhoea becoming more rampant these days,"" said Dr Nigam Prakash Narayan who recently did a study on the impact of air pollution on health./The doctor and his team examined 1,400 Patnaites as part of the study which was carried out in collaboration with PMCH and State Pollution Control Board (SPCB). ""The situation can get more alarming,"" Dr Narayan warned./A recent report of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)-New Delhi revealed higher level of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) - much more than the standards laid down by the CPCB - in the air in Patna. The RSPM level in residential areas indicates Patna is one of the country's 41 cities where the RSPM level has reached critical level. Similarly, the SPM level in Patna indicates the city is one of the country's 29 cities having critical SPM level. The SPM and RSPM levels have shown an increasing trend in Patna since 2003./""Vehicular traffic causes almost 70% of air pollution in Patna,"" said SPCB chairman Subhash Chandra Singh./SPCB monitors air pollution at two places in the state capital. The actual air quality level could be more critical at several other places where traffic and urbanization are more dense. Resource crunch is said to be the reason why the board is not setting up more monitoring units./There's a plan to open three well-equipped air pollution monitoring stations in Patna in collaboration with the Union ministry of environment. Under this plan, the static stations are to come up near the Dak Bungalow crossing, the Kargil roundabout near the Gandhi Maidan and the JP roundabout near the railway station. As has been the practice in metros, the proposed monitoring centres in Patna will also have LCD screens to display RSPM, SPM, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and other parameters./The three monitoring stations will be linked with the SPCB control room for creation of a database. As per the plan, the Centre and the state government have to share 50% of the cost. ""We are looking for funds for setting up these plants,"" Singh said./""The causes for air quality reaching critical levels are increase in vehicular traffic, rapid urbanization and ongoing construction activities for infrastructure development such as apartments, buildings and roads,"" said environmentalist Neeraj Jha. He suggested strict compliance of Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate norms, switch over to alternate fuel like CNG and a better public transport system in Patna as remedial measures./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Gensets blowing pollution norms up in air,"VARANASI: Do not be surprised if you are caught amidst clouds of black smoke effusing from gensets within a few minutes of a power cut in the city. If you think that coming out on the roads or open places could save you the hazardous smoke, the clouds would not let you free and even follow you on the roads./The power back-up sources which promise to provide respite from erratic power supply are fast turning out to be prominent sources of air and sound pollutions in the city./In majority of cases, it is the non-compliance of norms like using gensets without canopies (covers that act as filters for controlling air pollution) or without acoustic chambers (which keep the sound levels within permissible limits) that has emerged as a prime reason for the spread of pollution./It is a marriage season and the dwindling power supply has made the gensets dot every nook and corner of the city. The indiscriminate use of gensets has left the health experts worried in the region./The smoke effusing from gensets contains gases like sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide which are major air pollutants and aggravate the risk of pulmonary diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and asthma, said Dr JK Samaria of the department of chest diseases, Banaras Hindu University./The smoke produced by the gensets can pose major health risks. It can cause lung infections and problems in breathing, Samaria added./As per the recommendations of the committee on air pollution control constituted by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which has been also included under the Environment Protection Rules 1986, use of a canopy for a genset chimney (the part that releases smoke) is essential to control the air pollution level./As per an estimate, there are over 10,000 gensets in different parts of the city like in residential areas, shopping complexes and industrial areas. Several gensets are being used without canopies in violation of the norms. ""Who cares for canopies?

PDS kerosene diversion goes unchecked,"WARANGAL: Diversion and misuse of public distribution system (PDS) kerosene has become rampant in Warangal district with the active connivance of the authorities. So much so, the BPL kerosene is diverted to RTC hired buses, which run on diesel, and autos in suburban areas and villages./Highly-placed sources said over 60 per cent of BPL kerosene is misused or diverted by the PDS dealers in the district. ""It's an open secret. They mix kerosene in huge quantity in the diesel tank, pass it off as diesel and claim the fuel amount from RTC depots,"" sources said. While the RTC runs 900 buses in the district every day, 300 are hired services./Sources said the unrestrained diversion of PDS kerosene goes on at the cost of genuine BPL beneficiaries. ""We are not given our monthly supplies on the grounds of short supply. But, kerosene is supplied illegally to the agents,"" rued Sivaratri Saramma, a BPL cardholder from Wardhannapet./In fact, blackmarketing of kerosene has seen a spurt in the last two months after the government began the exercise of weeding out the bogus cards, sources revealed./Sources said the owners of the RTC hired buses resort to use of kerosene to cover up their transport losses. While a litre of diesel costs Rs 39, kerosene is priced at Rs 20 per litre. Even as the buses/autos run on kerosene leave a plume of black smoke and cause air pollution, the pollution control board personnel nor vigilance officials have cracked the whip on the erring drivers./The racketeers have also taken advantage of the kerosene quota given to Deepam (gas) connection holders in the villages by colluding with the dealers, it is learnt./""On an average, close to five lakh litres of BPL kerosene is being siphoned off.

Breathing in Varanasi gets shallow,"VARANASI: Are people living in urban areas of Varanasi taking shallow breaths instead of deep, lungful of air? It would definitely appear so if one went by the cross-sectional study conducted by a group of medicos of the department of physiology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University (BHU). The study suggested there had been a decline in the respiratory performance of Varanasi population in 22 years./According to Dr MB Mandal, one of the researchers, lung function tests were performed on apparently healthy, non-smoking male population aged 16-50 years living in the city area. The people were divided into five groups according to their age (16-19-yr, 20-25-yr, 26-30-yr, 31-35-yr and 40-50-yr). Anthropometric determinants (height and weight) and respiratory performance (vital capacity and peak expiratory flow rate) were recorded in 1982 and 2004./The other members of the study group were AK De and S Kumar. They found no significant difference in height, weight and body mass index between the age-matched groups in 1982 and 2004. However, both vital capacity (VC) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were found to be reduced in 2004 as compared to those measured in 1982 from the similar population matched for age groups./Over the past two decades, the air pollution had been of great concern in cities like Varanasi. According to the study, Varanasi experienced a remarkable growth in motor vehicle traffic without desirable monitoring of the emission. Available data indicated that vehicle registration as well as suspended particulate matters in air of Varanasi had increased. Pollution and Economic Research Laboratory, Centre for Advance study of Botany, BHU revealed about the increasing amount of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and respirable suspended particulate matters (RSPM) known to affect respiratory performance./While it is difficult to clinch a specific cause for the observed difference, atmospheric pollution and lifestyle changes are likely factors. The socio-economic factor is unlikely because it is difficult to believe that there has been a negative socio-economic growth in past two decades even in this relatively slow progressive region of the country. However, the results at large suggested an influence of increasing atmospheric pollution on airways and possible negative influence of increasingly sedentary lifestyles. The reduction of respiratory performance by air pollution due to automobile exhaust is well known and overcrowded Varanasi experienced exponential growth of automobile users during past two decades. Vehicle registration in Varanasi was increased by 750 per cent during 1985 to 2002./The estimated average annual level of SPM (428 microgram/m3) in residential area of Varanasi city 2001 was far above the national annual ambient air quality standard for residential areas (140 microgram/m3) for SPM. Therefore, it was possible that rise in air pollution might have played a crucial role in reducing respiratory performance./The authorities of UP State Pollution Control Board (UPSPCB) also admitted that levels of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) exceeded the prescribed standards in the city./The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report on ambient air quality also suggested that RSPM and SPM levels in Varanasi reached critical levels. The vehicular air pollution is one of the major factors responsible for the decline in ambient air quality. According to data submitted by the road transport office to the UPSPCB, over 4.5 lakh motor vehicles were operating in the district by 2007. Obviously the number of vehicles would have gone up since then./In recent studies with eight years follow-up, it was shown that exposure of children to major roadways adversely affected lung function growth during the period of 10 to 18 years and this could result in important deficit in lung function attained in the later part of life. Further, earlier studies emphasised the role of physical exercise in improving respiratory performance mainly of the young. In this study the age group of 20-30 years was particularly more affected as these groups showed deterioration of both VC and PEFR./Mandal, however, said it was difficult to ascertain any specific reason for it. A number of attractive TV channels available almost in every home might have facilitated the sedentary life style during early part of life. It may be speculated that during first two decades during their developmental stage, since their school days, this age group have largely shifted from outdoor sports to more passive forms of entertainment like watching TV and thus decreasing their physical activity levels in daily life. Moreover, after-school study coaching has increasingly encroached on their afternoon sports./The overall combined effect of such factors seemed to be probable cause for reduction in respiratory performance, especially in 20-30 years age group of population. It might be presumed that because of increased environmental pollution, lack of physical activity and comparatively slow socio-economic progress in this part of country, the younger section of adult male population of 2004 had lower values of VC and PEFR in comparison to those from the similar population of 1982./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Breathless in the city?,"Asthma may occur due to environmental and genetic factors. Other triggers could be cold weather and pollutants./Modern life is full of hassles, deadlines, frustrations and demands. For many people, stress is so normal that unfortunately it's become a way of life. Stress isn't always bad. In small doses, it can help you perform under pressure and motivate you to do your best.

For the first time, studies reveal that work pressure can actually make someone become an asthmatic./General physician Dr Parul Sheth agrees saying, ""It is known that living in urban areas, especially where there's a lot of air pollution, does increase the chances of developing asthma. And stress is a common asthma trigger./Stress and anxiety sometimes can make you feel short of breath and if you already have asthma it may cause your symptoms to become worse."" Pressure at work causes stress, which in turn can give you an array of health issues including gastric disorders. ""Manage your stress levels well.

You can try relaxation and deep-breathing exercises. Eat nutritious food and sleep well,"" she suggests. Interventional cardiologist Dr Hasmukh Ravat says that there is most definitely a link between stress and asthma, ""Stress is the cause for various health hazards and there has been an increase in heart diseases especially amongst youngsters in urban areas due to the excessive work pressure./Other than that, asthma is also greatly exaggerated,"" he says. His suggestion is to take time off work just to relax or maybe take a holiday./Chest physician Dr Rashid Vasi is not in complete agreement with this research. ""Asthma cannot come about just because of work pressure, but the symptom of a mild asthmatic can be greatly aggravated by work pressure. Any sort of mental pressure affects the entire body,"" he opines./Ways to manage work stress/- Take more breaks from your work. Even a five-minute break will help. Get away from your desk. Go for a walk outside if you can./- Lighten up! Laughter is known to reduce stress. You'll be amazed at how much more pleasant the people around you are when you make an effort to be pleasant yourself./- Fix your environment. Make whatever adjustments you need to the lighting, temperature, noise level and other/controllable factors in your office./- Get more sleep. In addition to reducing your stress, it will increase your energy levels and your ability to/concentrate./- Spend more time with optimistic people. Negative people will pull you down to their level./What is asthma?/An asthma attack causes the bronchial tubes or airways in your lungs to become inflamed and constricted. The muscles of the bronchial walls tighten and the bronchial tubes produce extra mucus, which then block your airways. Asthma may occur because of environmental and genetic factors. Exposure to various allergens and irritants can also trigger it. Some other triggers include cold weather, pollutants and dust./Follow us on Twitter for more stories /<a href=""http://www.twitter.com/toilifestyle"">http://www.twitter.com/toilifestyle</a>/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Also a water recirculation system would be prepared which would stop the ash to get discharged into the Pandu river,"" said UPPCB regional officer, Radhey Shyam, who claimed to have received the letter on Monday./Notably, the water recirculation system would not only allow the ash to get treated. It would also enable the treated water to be reused. The authorities also have plans to upgrade the decanter./An online monitoring system having an opacity meter would be installed within the power station premises which would automatically stop the emission of fly-ash from the station once it starts exceeding the permissible limit, said Shyam./According to reports, the authorities have written to the UPPCB to apprise it that the station would have to be shut down for a period of 60 to 70 days for its upgradation./The UPPCB, after serving notices to the Panki thermal power station for flouting the air and water-pollution norms, had recommended for its closure./The action was initiated on the complaints of the locals who claimed they were getting respiratory problems and that the ash coming out of the station was flying into their houses./According to the UPPCB officials, the adverse impact on vegetation and respiratory problems in human beings were increasing in colonies located near Panki industrial area due to unabated increase in SPM (suspended particulate matter) and ash in the surrounding area./""We had no option left but to recommend for its closure,"" said Shyam, who claimed to have received the complaints from the locals in writing./More so, the SPM levels were found to be 250 milligrammes per metre cube against the prescribed 150 milligrammes per metre cube area, which meant an increase of 44 per cent./According to experts, the increased levels of SPM can cause breathing problems in asthmatic patients. It was also learnt that the flying ash produced by the power plant after burning of coal affects the vegetation in the locality. The toxic ash reaches the fields and can damage the standing crops and plants./After the warning from the UPPCB authorities, the officials of the power station have initiated the upgradation process, which is expected to give some respite to the locals of Panki from air pollution./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"This season, Bangaloreis the sickest ever","BANGALORE: Bangalore with its gleaming, soaring towers and high-tech reputation doesn't conjure up images of illness and poor health. But according to a few of the city' most eminent doctors, Bangalore ""is the sickest ever"" they have seen in their decades of practice. The number of viral infections reported is the highest ever in the city./At an interaction organized at the TOI office on Friday, six eminent doctors of Bangalore said that there are more than 200 viruses in the air leading to ailments, which, while painful to deal with, are not fatal. Admissions in hospitals have gone up four-fold this year and doctors are working overtime to kill the viruses. Hospitals are a choc-o-bloc with even super-deluxe rooms overflowing./In Bangalore, the months between July and September are traditionally the worst from a health perspective when cases of dengue, viral fever and H1N1 peak./The reasons are rather basic, boiling down to poor hygiene, environmental degradation, air pollution, poor water and lack of awareness among people. Rapid population growth with migration is also a factor. For migration, historically brings with it newer viruses./Karnataka had the highest reported cases of dengue in the country this year but this also could be due to better reportage of registered cases here than elsewhere, said the doctors. They said that the emphasis should be on preventive measures for otherwise the rise in non-communicable diseases would lead to a major economic burden on the people and the government./Terming the infections as Influenza-like-illness (ILI) where a common cold has the potential to turn into a serious ailment, they said that proper diagnosis and early detection would remedy 90% of the people without recourse to hospitalisation. Only about 10% of the cases need serious medical attention./The onus for a healthy populace lies as much with the people as with the government and medical fraternity, they said. As one doctor said, ""even the sick in India go to work. We don't follow the simple cough etiquette which requires you to cover your mouth when coughing in public.""/The eminent doctors, however, said there was no reason to panic as Bangalore had the most advanced medical facilities in the country to combat any disease. Also, most cases are non-fatal in nature and the ill season will pass within the next two to three weeks./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Outdoor pollution better than smoking zones: study,"BANGALORE: If you are tired complaining about pollution during traffic jams and on roads, digest this: indoor air pollution in many places is much higher than the levels outdoor. The primary reason: tobacco./Levels of particulate matter of less than 2.5 microgram per cubic metre in smoking locations were two times higher than smoke-free locations and 14 times higher than the WHO target air-quality guideline./This and much more alarming data were the findings of a study conducted by the the Centre for Multi Disciplinary Development Research (CMDR), in association with the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, Roswell Park Cancer Institute and the Bloomberg Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use./Illegal smoking was detected in 45 out of the 79 locations sampled. Of the 45 places sampled in Karnataka where smoking was observed, only 11 had any of the required `no-smoking' signages. Sixty percent of the places visited showed smoking happening in the entrance or other adjacent outdoor areas. These were where people were exposed to harmful air upon entry and exit and smoke could drift to indoor places./In Bangalore, illegal smoking was found in 9 out of the 14 locations sampled. Places where indoor smoking was observed had high levels of air pollution (average level 143 microgram/m3). Of the nine places observed, seven did not have the required ""no-smoking"" signages. In fact, there were hardly any signages even in shops near educational institutions as stipulated in The Control of Tobacco Products Act (COTPA)./The researchers found that smoking was very heavy in Dharwad and so were violations of all rules./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Delhi's air quality worsens, haze over city","NEW DELHI: The daily air pollution data being generated in the city is proof that all is not well with the city's environment. Most Games venues are showing constantly high levels of particulate matter (PM) with levels of ozone and NO2 rising by evening. Clean Air Initiative (CAI) for Asian Cities, a Philippines-based organization, has also pointed out in its latest report that Delhi's air pollution is higher than the average of Indian cities./According to Safar, the online portal on Delhi's air quality being maintained by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, all of the past week saw poor levels of PM2.5 and PM10 on the air quality index at all 12 sites being monitored. Levels of ozone were poor at three venues and moderate at the remaining. The trend has been more or less similar since the Games started. The city has also been witnessing haze since last Wednesday, which, according to Met officials is going to continue for a few more days./The latest issue of Delhi's Race to Clean Air, the newsletter published by CAI, also states that based on data collected from over 130 Indian cities, Delhi's pollution levels are higher than the average of Indian cities, specially in context to PM10 and NO2. ""In 2008, the annual average levels of PM10 and NO2 were twice as high as the average of Indian cities,'' said the report. While NO2 was within permissible levels according to the 1994 parameter of 60 microgram/cu m, it now breaches the latest safe level of 40 micrograms/cu m./While launching Safar, the government had released specific data on PM2.5 levels in the city. According to that, ""the estimated total emission of PM2.5 for Delhi is calculated to be around 68.06 Gg/year in 2010. The trend of high emission of the order of 50-400 ton/year is found over Rajiv Chowk, Sansad Bhawan, India Gate, Indira Gandhi International Airport, Okhla Industrial Area, Pragati Maidan, IP-estate, Janakpuri, Meharuli, Lakshmi Nagar, etc. Large point sources like thermal power stations and other major industrial zones are the major contributors of PM2.5.''/The report further stated: ""This maiden study reveals that transport and residential sectors are two dominant sectors responsible for majority of pollution emissions in Delhi followed by industrial and power sectors. NOx emissions are on the rise whereas black carbon emissions are quite low. The unpaved roads have high potential of enhancing the emissions of fine particulate matters.''/While the government claims that there are no short term measures to deal with this kind of pollution, Anumita Roychoudhury of the Centre for Science and Environment says that the October phenomenon is setting in when the air, having become cooler, starts getting heavier and does not give pollutants much area to disperse. ""The initial data produced through Safar indicated several `good' days initially which was possibly a combination of the heavy showers and an overall reduction in traffic volumes due to the restrictions imposed by the government. It should learn lessons from the Games and ensure that it keeps the momentum on even after the Games are over,'' she said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Take precaution to avoid respiratory diseases,"VARANASI: If you are planning to visit traditional puja pandals in holy Shardiya Navratra in the city, here are a few health tips from the experts that could come handy while allaying the fear of contracting any allergic respiratory disease on the occasion./As per Dr J K Samaria of department of respiratory diseases, BHU, and secretary, Indian Chest Society (ICS), one needs to be alert and take preventive measures especially during the change of season (post-monsoon) beginning with holy Shardiya Navratra. The season also results in the increased presence of various allergens including dust and pollens putting young children and elderly people under higher risk of contracting respiratory diseases./A person already suffering from bronchitis or other lung diseases needs to be extra careful as the ailment may aggravate into a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), he added./Saying that the concentration of air pollutants also remains high during the festive season, Dr Samaria emphasised that the high concentration of dust particles caused by digging of trenches along the roads for various developmental projects has also added to the woes in the city./If possible, a person should cover his face or the nose with a handkerchief to avoid inhaling dust during the season. The elderly people and infants should remain indoors to avoid the risk of getting a respiratory disease, he added./It may be mentioned here that the ICS had organised a workshop on spirometry (a quick breathing test for getting early signs and diagnosis of lung diseases) in the city to mark the World Spirometry Day on October 14 this year./The aim of the workshop was to spread awareness on spirometry among doctors, patients and general public for promoting appropriate remedial measures and reducing the risks of lung diseases./According to Dr Samaria, some other measures like curbing smoking and reducing air pollution besides maintaining balanced diet and regular exercise could help improve the lung health./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Fog arrives, pollution leads to haze","NEW DELHI: The fog has made an early appearance this year. Thursday morning saw shallow fog in some parts of the city, specially around IGI Airport. The rest of the day was marked by a thick haze that was caused by a passing western disturbance and high level of pollution./According to Met officials, the atmosphere is highly stable currently and the presence of a high amount of moisture in the air led to the formation of fog. ""Between 2am and 9am, the general visibility had come down to 800m while for two hours after 9am, the runway visual range was fluctuating between 1,000m and 1,100m. Humidity was also above 75%, helped by moist easterly winds that are blowing currently. It was only after 3pm that visibility went up to 2,500m. The situation should continue for another day or so,'' said R K Jenamani, director in-charge, IGI Met./Once temperature started rising during the day, the mist slowly transformed into a haze that lasted till evening. ""The water vapour acts as nuclei for pollution particles to stick to. The atmosphere is quite stable and there is not much wind because of which the particles are not getting dispersed and remain suspended in the atmosphere. The levels of small particles in the form of particulate matter 10 and 2.5 are also quite high,'' said a Met official./Based on information from IITM's SAFAR programme, the air quality index of PM10 and 2.5 was in the poor category for almost the entire day with levels ranging from 201 to 275. ""In winter, air pollution levels are high since the air becomes heavier and there is no place for pollutants to disperse. However, Delhi is also seeing a lot of vehicular traffic which is leading to this problem,'' said an official./Because of the mist in the morning, the minimum temperature was five degrees above normal at 23 degrees Celsius. The day temperature was also warm at 32.7 degrees Celsius though there was no sun through the day. Humidity levels ranged between 56% and 91%./According to Met data, the western disturbance that is affecting the western Himalayan region currently would continue to impact the area and the adjoining plains of northwest India for another couple of days. ""Fairly widespread rainfall can be expected in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh till Saturday. This will also have an impact over the plains where some areas may see light rainfall but humidity over most areas will be quite high,'' said a Met official./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
CJM dismisses Ranthambore noise pollution case,"JAIPUR: The chief judicial magistrate at Sawai Madhopur on Tuesday dismissed a petition alleging violation of wildlife, environment and civic laws during the wedding of celebrity couple Russell Brand and Katy Perry held recently at Ranthambore./The petition was filed by Ranthambore Park Bachao Samiti through its president and local lawyer Akshay Sharma. It was alleged that the forest officials and the district administration officials overlooked violations of noise and air pollution and different sections of the Wildlife Protection Act by the star couple and their guests during their stay at the tiger reserve./The Samiti has now decided to move a revision petition before a higher court in an effort to bring the culprits to justice. ""It's unfortunate that before dismissing it, the magistrate didn't even consider it proper to get the complaint investigated first,"" Sharma told TOI while reacting to the court decision. ""I'll take the petition to the district judge tomorrow (Wednesday),"" he asserted, adding that the Samiti would never cease fighting for the protection of Ranthambore tigers./While arguing the petition before the chief judicial magistrate on October 31, Sharma accused the forest officials of causing territorial fights among the tigers just to please high-profile visitors and make illegal money. The Samiti holds the forest officials responsible for the death of a three-year-old male tiger, T-36, killed in a territorial fight with an older tiger, T-42. The fight was linked to the Russell-Katy marriage and the forest officials were accused of driving the big cats from their territories towards the celebrity couple's place of stay at a resort inside the national park./The Samiti also accused the couple of breaking the rules against loud music after 10 pm, smoking, consuming liquor and carrying firearms in the forest area, disturbing the endangered animals, changing movement routes assigned to them by the forest authorities and getting into a scuffle with the paparazzi inside the park and thereby risking human lives in the tigers reserve./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Take precautions, have safe Diwali","NEW DELHI: Those suffering from respiratory problems must take special care during Diwali. Air pollution due to burning of firecrackers can trigger asthma in patients and cause uneasiness among those in poor health. People are advised to be sensitive towards the health concerns of their near and dear ones while celebrating the festival of lights, say doctors. The crackers contain harmful chemicals such as lead, magnesium, zinc and copper - all of which release toxic fumes when burnt and cause sound pollution./''A lot of people in Delhi are today suffering from dengue and chikungunya, apart from other illnesses. The noise and smoke caused by firecrackers can be a nuisance for these patients and may cause discomfort. One should avoid crackers,'' said Dr Bir Singh, head of the community medicine department and incharge of disease prevention and outbreak response cell of AIIMS. He said that asthma patients and people suffering from respiratory problems such as bronchitis , laryngitis and pneumonia should stay indoors./''There are several factors - dip in temperature, viral infections, high levels of pollutants , etc - that contribute to the sudden increase in the number of asthma attack cases . Patients should take medicines on time,'' said Dr JC Suri, head of the department, pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine, Safdarjung Hospital./Though the Delhi government's campaign against firecrackers has significantly brought down the pollution levels in the capital, doctors say that a complete ban on firecrackers is impossible. Doctors say that asthma patients should avoid crowded places and cover themselves properly before going out. ''The best way to avoid an asthma attack is to avoid exposure to smoke, changing temperature and allergens that can trigger an attack. There is heavy pollen movement in the air, therefore, one should cover the face,'' said Dr RP Singh, senior consultant , internal medicine, Rockland Hospital./Dr Bir Singh said that diabetics and those suffering from kidney damage should avoid sweets.

"Your lungs at higher risk from wood smoke, dung cakes","PUNE: Indoor air pollution and not smoking is the most important cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in India, says a prevalence study conducted by Pune-based Chest Research Foundation (CRF) in collaboration with the KEM Hospital, Pune, and the Imperial College, London. In the West and other wealthier countries, smoking is the single most important causative factor of COPD./The CRF study found that the prevalence of the respiratory disease was 6.9 per cent in the Indian population. Among those identified with COPD, only 7 per cent were smokers while the remaining 93 per cent were non-smokers./Over 700 million people in India suffer from high levels of indoor air pollution affecting women and young children as 75 per cent homes use biomass fuel like wood, crop residue and dung cakes./Other research says that exposure to wood smoke through home heating and cooking or through ambient neighborhood pollution may further increase the risk of COPD and related pulmonary problems in smokers./The age factor was particularly disturbing. ""Nearly 23 per cent of COPDs occurred in people less than 40 years of age. It was believed that COPD starts after 40 in people who have been smoking for over 15-20 years. In India, where the exposure to indoor air pollution begins from childhood, it occurs in younger people,"" said chest physician Sundeep Salvi, director of the CRF./According to a report published by the Maharashtra State Health Resource Centre in March 2010 that examined the top 10 causes of deaths in Maharashtra, COPD was the number one cause./What can help at this moment is a national COPD control programme. ""We have such programmes for malaria, filariasis, tuberculosis and AIDS. The mortality is far too high in COPD than any of these diseases. Policy makers should take up the issue and act fast, "" said Salvi./""Even though there is no similar report from other states in India, it seems likely that COPD may be one of the leading causes of death in other states too. The WHO had compiled a nationwide analysis in 2002, and reported that deaths due to chronic respiratory diseases accounted for the second largest cause of death, with COPD as the main cause of respiratory deaths,"" said Salvi./He spearheaded the study along with social scientist Sanjay Juvekar from KEM Hospital and Peter Barnes, an eminent progessor of respiratory medicine at Imperial College, London (UK)./The study was conducted in 22 rural villages in Pune district with a population of over 1 lakh. As many as 3,000 adults over the age of 25 years were randomly selected for the study which used a standardised respiratory health questionnaire and spirometry (lung function test for determining COPD)./In the western, tobacco smoking is believed to be the most important risk factor for COPD. However, recent evidence refutes this. ""Exposure to biomass fuel smoke is the biggest risk factor, not only for India, but even globally. Compared to 1.1 billion smokers, more than 3 billion people (50% of the global population) use biomass fuel for cooking and heating purposes worldwide,"" Salvi said./""A woman living in a rural home in India spends on an average 60,000 hours cooking during her lifetime, during which she inhales a total volume of 25 million litres of polluted air. This causes extensive damage to the lungs leading to the development of COPD,"" he said./Tobacco smoking is the second biggest cause of COPD in India. As the numbers of smokers increase in India, the burden of COPD is estimated to rise further. The other causes of COPD include poorly treated chronic asthma, certain occupations such as building and construction, mining, sand blasting, leather industry and farming, recurrent lung infections during childhood and poor nourishment especially during childhood./BOX/What is COPD ?/COPD which stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a lung disease that causes a blockage or narrowing of the airways, the tubes in your lungs that air flows through. This results in a decrease in the flow of air, both in and out of your lungs.

World COPD Day to be observed today,"VARANASI: World COPD Day is an annual event organised by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) to create awareness about the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) around the world. World COPD Day 2010 is going to take place on Wednesday (November 17) with a theme ""2010 - The Year of the Lung: Measure your lung health - Ask your doctor about a simple breathing test called spirometry.""/COPD is a substantially under diagnosed disorder, whose diagnosis is delayed until the condition reaches in advanced state. Spirometery is the most frequently used pulmonary function test and enables health professionals to make an objective measurement of airflow obstruction and assess the degree to, which it is reversible, said Dr SK Agarwal, senior professor of department of chest disease, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University. According to him, the COPD is projected to be the third leading cause of death by 2020./""The Indian Chest Society (ICS) is seriously concerned about the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COPD by means of spreading awareness and education about the disease,"" said Dr JK Samaria, honorary secretary of ICS and senior consultant at the department of chest, IMS-BHU. The society had been continuously performing training and research activities to minimise the impact of the disease, he added. According to him, the COPD is a disease appearing similar to Asthma but much more lethal and different from it. The COPD is characterised by prolonged cough with excess sputum production and breathlessness. Initially the breathlessness is observed after light work out but gradually it may occur even while sitting idle as well. The breathlessness caused due to Asthma can be completely cured after proper medication, but unfortunately same is not the case with COPD./The chest experts said that the COPD was a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality throughout the world. It is the fourth leading cause of death in the world, and further increase in its prevalence and mortality can be predicted in coming decades. The GOLD defines COPD as a preventable and curable disease with some significant extra pulmonary effect that may contribute to the severity in individual patients, said Agarwal./Citing a report from WHO Samaria said that more than 90 percent of COPD mortality involved poor countries with people having lower per capita income. In India the COPD among the rural families is a major cause of concern. Among these females cooking on cow dung and wooden fire is one of the major causes of COPD. The COPD spreads rapidly among people living in rural and semi-urban localities due to use of kerosene stoves for cooking, lack of proper ventilation and usage of mosquito coil. Atmospheric air pollution is yet another major cause of COPD and ever increasing quantum of automobiles and pollution due to their exhaust is making the matter worst./According to the chest experts, in India clear data is not available but it is suspected that COPD may be one of the major cause of mortality here as well. A survey performed in 2006 at various centres of the country revealed the fact that there were over 40 million COPD patients in India, said Samaria adding that the prevalence of COPD in non-smoking female patients was quite significant. The ratio of male to female COPD patients is as high as 1.5:1 in India./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Smoking is not the sole cause of smoker's disease',"CHENNAI: Contrary to popular belief, smoking may not be the only risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - also called smoker's disease - in India. A two-year study conducted in collaboration with KEM Hospital and Imperial College, London, in 22 villages of Pune district has shown that among the people identified as suffering from COPD, as many as 93% were non-smokers./The study shows that exposure to indoor air pollution is the most important cause for COPD. It was found that since a significant percentage of Indians live in villages with 75% of the homes using biomass fuel, it was exposing 700 million people to high levels of indoor air pollution./However experts were skeptical about the sample size of the study, which included only people from the villages. ""Though it is true that from now smoking alone cannot be seen as one of the biggest risk factors, it does not mean that smokers are not at risk. High number of non-smokers were found to be suffering from COPD because the study was done in villages,"" said Dr Madhu K, consultant pulmonologist, Frontier Lifeline./He also mentioned that till now it was thought that smoking was the most important cause for COPD. But other factors like indoor and outdoor air pollution, usage of biomass fuels at home can cause COPD. ""Children and women are also more vulnerable to COPD as they are victims of passive smoking,"" said Dr Madhu./Frontier lifeline conducted a free spirometry test (Pulmonary function test) for the World COPD Day on Wednesday in accordance with this year's theme, ""Know your Lung Health"". Of 90 patients in the age group 40-80 tested, 72 of them were found to be suffering from COPD. Out of those who had registered, 80% of them had a history of smoking.

Delhi breathing deadly gases,"NEW DELHI: 'Delhi's cocktail of poisonous gases is posing a huge threat to the city,' claims the Centre for Science and Environment. The organisation analysed air pollution data of the city between November and December and has said that this year, while pollution levels are quite high, it is not just particulate matter that is posing a problem but a deadly mix of ozone, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen./''The official disease statistics show that acute respiratory diseases being reported in the city went up by 28% between 2005 and 2008. The city has a growing number of vehicles, many of them diesel, and this is taking a huge toll on the health of Delhiites. The government has already exhausted its soft options and now needs to take strong measures to curb the city's growing vehicle numbers,'' said Anumita Roychowdhury, associate director, CSE./In its analysis of Central Pollution Control Board's air quality index, CSE found that several locations in the city were being subjected to a lethal mix of pollutants. In 10 days of December, levels of PM2.5 and NO2 breached the safe level on seven days. In November, PM2.5 levels were unhealthy on all 30 days while Ozone was in the unhealthy bracket for 28 days. ''PM2.5 also reached critical levels on some occasions, reaching 1.5 times their standard while ozone levels were critical on a couple of days,'' said Roychowdhury./''Winter has only speedened up the rising trend of pollutants. Ozone witnessed in strong sun, has also been showing a rising trend this winter. With an hourly standard of 180 micrograms per cum, it has peaked at 268. At RK Puram, concentration of oxides of nitrogen has been doubling during peak traffic hours as compared to non-peak hours. Levels of PM2.5 in the morning are again more than double as compared to non-peak hours. At Civil Lines, NO has been doubling during peak hours whereas at IGI airport, NO2 levels shoot up during evening peak hours. In November, the 8-hourly average of CO was more than 3.5 times in excess of standards,'' she said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Testing bomb blasts, chemical warfare agents made easy","ALLAHABAD: Be it testing debris of bomb blasts or finding the presence of sulphur in chemical warfare agents, air pollution harming the ozone layer, petroleum adulteration or processing of natural gas, detection of the element has always been a tedious task, surly not possible outside the labs. But the work of a young scientist is set to change it all./Vyom Parashar, who's working at the Nanotechnology Application Centre (NAC) of the Allahabad University, has developed nanomagnets which could revolutionise the technique of sulphur detection as it would not only check the presence of sulphur, but also separate it from a given sample --even sample collected from the site of a bomb blast./This single assay for quick isolation and detection of sulphur containing compounds from any possible medium one can think of, has been done by Vyom and his guide Prof A C Pandey working at the NAC. His work has been published in a recent paper in `Analytical Methods', owned by the Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK, which is one of the largest and most dynamic publishers of chemical science information in the world. Impressed by the long term application of the pioneering work, the Society has dedicated the cover page of its recent issue for this work./Talking to TOI about the work, Vyom said: ""Our approach is directed towards the simultaneous determination and removal of sulphur molecules in which a sulphur-containing sample is encountered with nanomagnets made of gadolinium (a rare earth mineral with natural magnetic properties). It produces visible red colour which means that the given sample contains sulphur. Then the coloured portion is detectable with the naked eye and simultaneously can be removed from the solution by applying an external magnetic field by using a simple permanent magnet.""/Interestingly, the nonomagnet developed by Vyom is of the size of approximately 1/100,000 the width of a human hair./The technique can be used for smaller scale, say for detection of composition of bombs or chemical warfare agents, to larger use, i.e., adulteration in petrol, he said./Talking about the applications of the technique, Prof Pandey said: ""The vast application of this detection technique includes clinical diagnostics such as early monitoring of amino acids, proteins and polypeptides containing sulphur derivatives in various biological samples, e.g., human blood serum, urine, tissues and tumours of patients.""/As sulphur derivatives are responsible for various diseases, its detection gives a clear indication for the early diagnosis of several severe human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, neural tube defect, inflammatory bowel disease, osteoporosis, retarded growth, hair de-pigmentation, lethargy, liver damage, muscle and fat loss and skin lesions or metabolic disorders./Commenting on the portability of the technique and its usefulness, chief food inspector (Allahabad) Hari Mohan Srivastava said: ""Most of the samples are send to Lucknow or Varanasi and if this kind of technique is made available locally, detection of sulphur adulteration could be revolutionised.""/""The idea that you could essentially, on a single assay platform, detect sulphur from a broad diversity of matrix that are at such a wide range of concentrations with such sensitivity is really, truly remarkable,"" said Prof Pandey, the principal investigator of Nanotechnology Application Centre at AU, who was also involved with the research./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Winter pollution leads to rise in health problems,"PUNE: The cold weather during the last few days has led to a rapid build up of winter pollution, leading to 20-25 per cent rise in respiratory health problems in the city./The pollution level in the city has increased almost 20-30% compared to the summer months and more than doubled compared to the monsoon season. The rise in pollutants is higher during the peak hours of traffic and at night. This was observed by the regular air quality monitoring carried out by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) here./Gufran Beig, programme director and scientist at the IITM told TOI that during the winter the air pollution level increases as the boundary layer (the top-most portion of local environment) comes down. This results in an increase in nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter or fine particles (PM 2.5, i.e., particles less than 2.5 micrometers, and PM10, i.e., particles of 10 micrometers or less)./Sandeep Salvi, director of the Chest Research Foundation said that there has been 20-25% increase in respiratory problems this season, mainly due to vehicular pollution. ""Since the temperature is low, pollutants gets suspended in the air for longer periods. This raises the pollution level. Construction activities and burning of wood and dried leaves also lead rise in pollution level.''/It affects the lungs and windpipes. Young children with recurrent episodes of cold and cough and elderly people with underlying diseases are more vulnerable, Salvi said./In addition, a higher level of ozone pollution is also persists during the winter months. Beig said that, as far as ozone is concerned, the situation is worse in Pune compared to Delhi. In Pune, there is only a moderate increase in the nitrogen dioxide level with 6-25 ppb (parts per billion) which helps in production of ozone that reaches up to 65-70 ppb during afternoon. Whereas in Delhi, there is a huge increase in nitrogen dioxide level of more than 100 ppb, which is bad but at the same time it helps in reduction in ozone level through titration. Hence the latter process is a blessing is disguise./Ozone is not directly emitted by any source but is produced through the emissions of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide (NOx), carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds in the air under the influence of sunlight. In the highly congested traffic areas, the nitrogen dioxide level shoots up drastically. The NOx level is increasing in Pune and hence the ozone level also. But it hasn't reached the level where it starts reducing the ozone level. So, both nitrogen dioxide and ozone levels are up in the city, Beig said./The major source of nitrogen dioxide is vehicular pollution. For PM2.5 and PM10, both vehicular pollution and dust from paved and unpaved roads contributes almost equally. During winter, the particulate pollution increases during night due to the fall in temperature. The level remains much higher from midnight to early morning with the maximum PM concentration between 4 am and 5 am./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
December trend: Sneezing and wheezing cases are on the rise,"CHENNAI: With increasing air pollution levels due to vehicular pollution, construction debris, industrial waste and burning of municipal waste, the city is seeing a huge rise in cases of respiratory diseases and pulmonary disorders./Doctors say pollution is one of the main triggers for asthma, particulalry during the months of December and January. Hospitals across the city have recorded an increase in the number of asthma cases this month. A random survey by the Asthma and Allergy Resource Centre, Mylapore, found that at least 18% of people were prone to asthma. ""In the urban areas, the figures go up to 25%. Many won't admit that. But when we put them on nebulizers and aerosols, they feel better,"" said Dr R Sridharan, who heads the centre./Medical records of many hospitals show an increase in respiratory diseases among people living in the city. While there have been at least 30,000 patients at the Government General Hospital, Kilpauk Medical College more than 16,000 patients in 2010. Private hospitals claim to have handled at least a 20% increase in the last two years./Doctors say that from the 12th leading cause of death, respiratory diseases have moved to the fourth in Chennai. At least six of the 10 top causes of death are related to respiratory disease. Respiratory diseases affect all age groups and class. Paediatricians say that at least one in eight children are prone to asthma. ""Heredity is a factor, but increased pollution in the city is a major trigger,"" said Indian Academy for Paediatrics president Dr S Balasubramanian, who works with the Kanchi Kamakoti Childs Trust Hospital./A study by M V Hospital for diabetes lead by Dr Vijay Vishwanathan, which screened over 900 people showed that at least 17.2% of the people had respiratory illness and 13.5% had other infections. Anaemia was high among females of all age groups and many children were found to be underweight. ""In Chennai, more than 25% of the city's total population were slum dwellers. About 40% of this slum population lives along the rivers and canals of Chennai and the rest on the pavements of the city. The slum population of metropolitan cities is largely exposed to pollution and neglected in terms of provision of health care facilities,"" says Dr Vijay Vishwanathan./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Oxygen cabins for traffic cops in Vadodara,"VADODARA: Traffic policemen in the city will now get the opportunity to get a breath of fresh air while on duty./The city police will inaugurate oxygen chambers for traffic policemen on New Year's day. This is an initiative being implemented for the first time in the state and coincides with the traffic week celebrations./Traffic cops have to bear the brunt of increasing traffic pollution as they have to stand amidst vehicles emitting smoke. This often proves dangerous for their health and in some cases often leads to respiratory system related ailments./""Exposure to air pollution can harm anybody, particularly our traffic policemen who stand in the midst of vehicle pollution. The oxygen cabin will provide them air with nearly 99 per cent saturated oxygen content,"" said deputy commissioner of police (administration) P K Roushan./Roushan said that such booths were provided to traffic policemen in some metros, but would be deployed for the first time in the state. ""Any traffic policeman who feels that he needs some fresh air after spending time on the road can use it. It will give him some relaxation and fresh air,"" he added./Roushan pointed out that the booth has a machine that uses air available in atmosphere and purifies it in a manner that it has high oxygen content. This is then blown inside the chamber where policemen can sit and breathe it./Each such unit will cost between Rs 2.5 to 3 lakh. Presently four such units are being installed at Sayajigunj, Laheripura, Race Course Circle and Amitnagar Circle.

"Air pollution, SPM add to winter chill","LUCKNOW: Increasing levels of air pollution in the state is also proving to be a major contributor to the formation of dense fog and low day temperatures in winters./Aerosols or Suspended Particle Matter (SPM) emitted by vehicles and industries in the air combine with the moisture content in the atmosphere to increase the density of the fog, which lasts for a longer period. The fog thus formed bars penetration of sun rays leading to fall in temperatures during the daytime./According to the UP Pollution Control Board, the SPM level in major cities of the state is three to five times than the standard limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre. The cities mainly responsible for high vehicular and industrial pollution are Lucknow, Kanpur, Agra, Varanasi, Jhansi, Allahabad, Meerut, Ghaziabad and Noida./The number of vehicles in UP have increased five times in last two decades; from 21 lakh in 1990 to 1.02 crore in 2010. The number of vehicles is said to be increasing at the rate of 5-10 per cent per year./In Lucknow alone, over one lakh vehicles are registered with the regional transport office./""Definitely, air pollution is fast becoming a major reason for a dense fog,"" said JP Gupta, state meteorological director. ""The smoke and fog combine to become smog, which can be seen even when temperatures are moderate,"" he added. Former, state meteorological director, RK Verma, when contacted said, ""Aerosols absorb moisture and blend with the fog formed due to condensation of moisture due to cold air."" This combination, he added, is more thick and dense in comparison to the normal fog, hence it lasts for a longer period and gets cleared only when sun rays are assisted by the moderate wind./The change in the weather conditions has been more severe in last few years, particularly in January after heavy snowfall in the hill areas. The SPM are present in the atmosphere in summers also, but do not pose much problem because moisture content is the atmosphere is very low. In monsoon season, the pollutants are cleared by rainfall. However, in winters, as temperatures come down due to icy winds coming to plains from the snow clad hills, the moisture content is condensed into fog. The presence of SPM expedites the process of fog formation, leading to drop in day temperatures and chilly weather./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Green ban flouted opposite Writers,"KOLKATA: In a blatant violation of existing guidelines against burning of organic matter in the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) area, a huge heap of dry leaves was set ablaze on Tuesday at Lal Dighi, bang opposite Writers' Buildings./Not only does a Pollution Control Board (PCB) guideline prohibit burning of organic matter in KMC area, a Calcutta high court order bans the practice within 3 km of Victoria Memorial Hall. The state secretariat lies within the prohibition zone./The dry leaves and rubbish that had been swept off the streets in the BBD Bag area, which houses several heritage buildings and is a declared heritage site by World Monuments Fund, were set on fire by the conservancy staff appointed by the state PWD on Tuesday morning./While the poor do resort to burning leaves, twigs and even toxic materials like plastic and rubber to keep warm in the winter chill, the incident that happened on Tuesday did not have anything to do with it and hence does not deserve to be ignored on humanitarian grounds./Eyewitnesses said the mound of leaves and rubbish was being stacked on the western flank of the tank adjoining Netaji Subhas Road for several days, and on Tuesday, the heap was set on fire at several points in the morning to dispose the refuse./When TOI passed the spot mid-afternoon, the area was/still smouldering and emitting toxic fumes. Pedestrians had to cover their face to make way through the blanket of smoke. An acrid smell hung heavy in the air, forcing drivers of government cars parked along the western flank of Lal Dighi to roll up the windows./Learning of the incident, a PCB official said the matter would be probed. ""It is extremely unfortunate that over a decade after the rules were laid down, they continue to be flouted. Not only does the practice give rise to toxic fumes like carbon monoxide, it also increases the concentration of particulate matter in the air, leading to a quantum jump in air pollution,"" the environment department official said./Green activist Subhas Datta, whose PIL on saving Victoria Memorial Hall had led to a Calcutta HC order in 2005 banning the practice of burning organic matter within a 3-km radius of Victoria Memorial Hall, said the act was not just shocking, it was indicative of the callousness within the administration./""The PWD used to sweep the streets and Maidan of litter and then burn it. The petition successfully got the practice banned. But it continues to be violated.

Air pollution rises as mercury dips,"KANPUR: Over 45 lakh population of the city survives under the thick blanket of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) as dust pollution increases during winters./The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board reports show that SPM and RSPM in the city have crossed the permissible limit. Against the bearable upper limit of 100 micro gram per cubic metre, the level of RSPM in the city has been measured at 227 micro gram per cubic metre, which was 20 micro gram more than figures recorded in 2009. The SPM level in the densely populated areas of the city was recorded as high as 478 micro gram per cubic metre, which is two times more than the bearable upper limit./According to weather experts, increase of dust particles in the air is common during winters due to reduced humidity. The current humidity level, which is less than 50 per cent, has lead to the drying of the soil surface that has resulted in increased SPM and RSPM. Since the roads have been dug up for laying of sewer lines, dust particles form a layer in the air that is visible in the evenings. The density of these dust particles is much higher where construction work is rampant. Areas like KG Road, Parade, Lal Imli crossing, Juhi, Lal Bangla and many others experience more dust pollution in the evenings./Doctors say that the dust causes respiratory ailments like allergy, dry cough, asthma and other pulmonary diseases. ""The level of air pollution has increased. Number of patients suffering from respiratory problems, too, has risen,"" said Dr Sudhir Chaudhary, head, department tuberculosis and respiratory disease, Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) Medical College./Dr SK Katiyar said: ""Particulate matter passes through nose and stick to the mucus of the trachea, which is thrown out of the body in the form of cough.

Cancer in UP to rise by 56% in 10 yrs: WHO,"LUCKNOW: Tobacco is not only associated with cancers. It's bad effect reflects other parts of the body too. Addiction to nicotine for instance can alter the way brain works, while other chemicals can take sheen away from your skin. Facts on cancer like this and more were released on the eve of cancer awareness day./A number of programmes are being organised in the state to mark the occasion. Medical institutions including the Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University and Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences would also deliberate on better management and prevention of diseases./International researches have shown that tobacco intake adversely affects the way heart and lungs functions. Experts at the medical university said that smoking is the major cause of heart attacks across the world. The heart begins to beat faster with the first puff of smoke. Blood vessels clamp down raising blood pressure and forcing the heart to work harder. Pulmonologists add that a smoker has 20 times more chances of getting lung cancer. But long before that, one may develop asthma and other lung disease could grip the smoker./Facts from WHO show that cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world. There are some 2.5 million cancer patients in India. More than half a million new cancer patients are added every year. A World Health Organisation estimate shows that cancer incidence in India would rise by 68% in the next two decades. In UP, the cancer population will swell by 56% by 2020. Radiotherapy is the basic treatment for cancers, besides surgery and chemotherapy./Incidentally, about 40% of cancer deaths can be prevented. Tobacco use is the single most important risk factor for cancer especially in India. Some other factors include: being overweight or obese, low fruit and vegetable intake, physical inactivity, alcohol use, sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV and HPV, urban air pollution, indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels among others./Cancer arises from one single cell.

Emerging evidences show the pollutants prevent insulin from working properly and reduces the ability of insulin in lowering blood sugars, resulting in diabetes./""Particluate matter in the air which is very fine and is less than 2.5 microns in size is called PM2.5 and has been known to cause diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Especially if people are already predisposed to diabetes, as many Indians are, the pollutants could aggravate the problem,"" said professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Ohio State University, Dr Sanjay Rajagopalan./He said that in the 1980s and 1990s the focus was on particulate matter greater than 10 microns in size which are known to cause respiratory problems, but now many countries have started identifying the harmful effects of PM2.5./""In the US and Europe, standards for PM2.5 are 15 microgram per cubic metre annually.

"Obesity, parental smoking cause asthma among kids: Study","KANPUR: The rise in pollution and genetic inheritance are generally perceived to be the common factors of asthma among children. But in a study conducted by the paediatrics department of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) Medical College pointed out that children are getting prone to this respiratory illness due to obesity, parental smoking and bottle-feeding instead of breast-feeding in newborn stage./After conducting study on as many as 300 children in age group of 1-12 years, a team of doctors, under the guidance of Dr RP Singh, head of the department of paediatrics found that besides air pollution, factors like obesity, parental smoking and bottle feeding are the other major reasons./""Obesity has become prevalent among kids of 8-10 years. These kids are overweight and inactive and have failed in doing certain exercises. Obesity at young age develops asthma more than twice more than those kids having appropriate weight as per height,"" said Singh./Nearly 45 per cent of the surveyed children from 1-4 years age group are likely to have asthma, as they were dependent on bottle feeding instead of mother's milk. Similarly, 32 per cent from 5-9 years had chronic or recurrent symptoms of asthma either due to parental smoking or family history./Notedly, these children generally suffer from nocturnal cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness and heartburn. In case of asthma, due to inflammation of the walls which is triggered by the irritants, the thickness of the walls decreases which results in a smaller passageway for air to flow through. The inflamed tissues produce an excess amount of sticky mucus into the tubes which clump together and block the smaller airways. Therefore, during an asthma attack the muscles tighten, constricting the passage of airways./Besides, particulate matter, asthma can be triggered due to pollen grains, dust, mites, pets, insects, foods such as fish, egg, peanuts, cows milk and additives as well./Dr Singh said: ""Shortness of breath, especially with exertion, wheezing, whistling or hissing sound when breathing out, chronic coughing usually at night and early morning are the main symptoms which may occur after exercise or when exposed to cold and dry air.""/He suggested that the asthmatic children to take extra care and avoid things to which they are allergic.

'Burning of fallen leaves poses health hazards',"JAIPUR: Past 9 pm just a little away from the Statue Circle, the street lights turned faint by smoke failed to show the way to traffic. Thick smoke bellowed out of the roadside dustbins parked right adjacent to an electricity pole. Burning fallen tree leaves in Jaipur is a practice that goes unnoticed for its environmental hazards, even while world over, burning fallen leaves has been banned by most governments. And why burn leaves when they can be fruitfully used to make garden compost that adds vital organic matter to build up soil and retain more moisture, feel residents./""Composting leaves is the most eco-friendly alternative to burning. Dry leaves alone will take a long time to break down, but mixing them in green plant materials, such as grass trimmings and even organic kitchen waste from the hotels will speed up the process. All this can be collected by the Jaipur Municipal Corporation and mixed with rich sources of nitrogen, such as livestock manure and used to make the 'Harit Rajasthan', greener and healthier,"" said Ajai Singh a landscape specialist./Even in our country, many towns and cities offer curbside pickup of leaves and other yard waste, which they turn into compost for park maintenance or for sale commercially, he said./Leaf burning is banned in most municipalities because it leads to air pollution, health problems and fire hazards. Leaf smoke may also contain hazardous chemicals such as carbon monoxide, which can bind with hemoglobin in the bloodstream and reduce the amount of oxygen in the blood and lungs. Another noxious chemical commonly present in leaf smoke is benzo (a) pyrene, which has been shown to cause cancer in animals and is believed to be a major factor in lung cancer caused by cigarette smoke. While breathing in leaf smoke can irritate the eyes, nose and throat of healthy adults, it can wreak havoc on small children, the elderly and people with asthma or other lung or heart diseases./""I feel choked with the smoke caused by burning leaves in our locality. Because I am an asthmatic patient, I have to immediately shut my windows when they burn leaves,"" said a city resident./Leaf burning gives off major pollutants in the form of particulates, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. In addition to the chemical pollutants released, mold spores are distributed in the plume of the fire. These spores may affect people with allergies./And because of the moisture that is usually trapped within leaves, they tend to burn slowly and thus generate large amounts of airborne particulates-fine bits of dust, soot and other solid materials. These particulates can reach deep into lung tissue and cause coughing, wheezing, chest pain, and sometimes long-term respiratory problems./Nearly 85% of the particles from leaf smoke are inhaled deep in the lungs which can cause adverse physical or chemical effects. ""The most harmful release with burning leaves is the suspended particulate material SPM which can aggravate problems for a patient with asthma,"" said Dr Vijendra Singh, head asthma and pulmonary diseases, SMS Hospital./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

While authorities and ship-breakers deny the presence of asbestos, which is proven to have cancer-causing links, or any significant pollution , workers say many rustylooking iron sheets of old ships lined up for dismantling contain asbestos. ""None of the ships are without asbestos in their bodies,"" said Maruti Vishwasrao , secretary of the Mumbai Port Trust, Dock and General Employees' Union. A study of workers in Alang, which was commissioned by the Supreme Court in 2006, found nearly 16% of them carrying traces of asbestos./Besides pollution, the safety of workers remains a major concern, said Vishwasrao. Many workers toil without the mandatory safety helmet, protective boots or goggles. Several said they hammer iron sheets without earplugs, as recommended by the International Labour Organization and national pollution control bodies. Their labour comes at Rs 270/day for around 12 hours of work (Rs 22.50/hour), even as many report frequent breathing trouble./""Our employers are only concerned about the work and salary. There is no other facility , not even basic drinking water,"" said worker Pyarelal Moraiya. Another worker, Narsimha Chauhan, who has also worked at Alang, said Mumbai needs to learn a few lessons about safety and facilities from there./But Pratap Bohra, of the Ship-breakers ' Association, rubbished concerns related to environmental pollution. ""Asbestos has been banned since 1985, so the ships which come for breaking do not contain asbestos in their bodies. Moreover , Mumbai, unlike Alang, does not deal with passenger ships, so such concerns are unfounded ,"" said Bohra. He said the overall pollution would compare to that emanated by any steel plant, so there is no cause for worry. ""Hazardous waste is handled as per protocol ,"" he added. But Bohra admitted that worker safety remains a matter of concern./Dr Y B Sontake, regional MPCB officer in charge of Darukhana, echoed Bohra's views. He said, ""We monitor the area for pollution and there is no significant threat from ship-breaking operations."" Speaking about Darukhana's 153 ug/m3 RSPM level, Sontake argued that Mumbai in general has higher RSPM levels. But, a comparison with MPCB's April data shows RSPM levels in Bandra and Mulund standing at only 87 and 110 ug/m3, respectively. Sion stood at a high 168 ug/m3, but that suburb is known for higher pollution levels due to the RCF factory in Chembur and a nearby dumping ground./UN officer Okechukwu Ibeanu, who visited the yard in January 2010, observed in a report submitted in September : ""In view of the small scale of ship-breaking activities in Mumbai (compared to Alang), the regulatory authority reportedly plays a relatively less active role than its counterpart in Alang/Sosiya, especially with regard to the enforcement of national legislation on health and safety at work and environmental protection.""/Ibeanu questioned the attitude of government agencies that deny the adverse environmental impacts of shipbreaking and ""regretted not having received updated scientific data from the regulatory authorities concerned and the state pollution control boards with regard to the actual impact of ship-breaking activities in Alang and Mumbai on environmental media"" ./CHEMICAL FEARS/Substances involved in ship-breaking :/ASBESTOS:/Exposure may cause asbestosis or cancer.

More cars on city roads may choke you,"LUCKNOW: The past few years have seen more and more fourwheelers and two-wheelers zipping across the city roads. But, surprising as it may sound, this trend may affect our health in the long run. An IITR report on air quality, released on Sunday, claims as much. The Indian Institute of Toxicology Research report says that vehicular increase of 9.23% during 2010-11 is one of the biggest reasons for rising pollution levels in residential, commercial and industrial areas of the city./The tail pipe emission from vehicles is one of the important source of air pollutants like RSPM, trace metals and gases. The respirable particles are responsible for cardiovascular as well as respiratory diseases. Traffic congestion, encroachment, cleanliness and maintenance of roads, weather, type of fuel and vehicle used, population density, driving habits and topographical influence of the area are other factors contributing to increase of fine particles and RSPM in the air./The ambient air quality assessment report showed that Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) level at 10 monitoring locations was higher than the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The same was true of fine particles. The rising level of particulate matter in the air is a major concern. Besides, other pollutants like carbon monoxide, ozone and metals like lead and nickel were also found in the air but, to comparatively lesser degree./""The higher levels of PM could be because of local construction activity,"" said the report. It also blamed the rapid economic development, industrialisation and higher level of energy consumption for the air pollution./Further, traffic noise has become a major environmental concern in urban areas witnessing high traffic congestion. Sources of noise in urban areas are primarily vehicular engines, exhaust systems, aerodynamic friction and tyre-pavement interaction./Traffic noise is affected by factors like traffic volume and speed, vehicle mix, pavement type and vehicle conditions./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Burning leaves choke Sarabha Nagar,"LUDHIANA: The residents and shopkeepers in Sarabha Nagar had a tough time on Tuesday afternoon thanks to the careless attitude of municipal corporation (MC) employees who set piles of dry leaves afire in a nearby park. This, despite the fact that there is a complete ban on doing so./The resultant overpowering smell and smoke made it difficult for people in the area to breathe for almost two hours./The residents say it has become a regular feature for sweepers to collect dry leaves and make a bonfire. People who ventured out had to put up with swathes of smoke and its pungent smell emanating from the piles of burning leaves. This led to their eyes watering and sent some of them into spasms of coughing, apart from reducing visibility./A student who resides in B block, Anu Khurana, said it was around 12 noon that sweepers put the dry leaves on fire and the smoke soon engulfed the entire residential area as well as main market. She wondered why the sweepers didn't bury the leaves in pits rather than burning them./A sales manager in a private company, Raman Kumar, said this practice is a health hazard as it could impact people with heart ailments and trigger respiratory problems among children. Burning/of leaves also increases air pollution, reduces visibility and damages property, therefore MC employees should desist from this, he added./Rita Shahi, a homemaker, said, ''To save time the sweepers collect and burn leaves in parks, without bothering that they are adding to air pollution or spoiling the verdant beauty of parks.''/The corporation officers said they did not know about the incident. Additional commissioner Mahinder Pal said, ''The incident has not been brought to my notice and I would be able to comment only after checking things.''/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution back as big health threat in Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Ten years after the city's public transport switched to CNG, air pollution has again become a major threat to public health in Delhi, say environmentalists. With 69 lakh vehicles plying on city roads, a growth of about 60 lakh in 20 years, experts say oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) are now at critically high levels./NOx and PM are known to cause cancer and asthma. Medical experts say signs of deteriorating health are already manifest. The Delhi cancer registry maintained by AIIMS shows a 2-3% rise in lung cancer cases every year./Dr Vinod Raina, a cancer specialist at AIIMS says till some years ago, 14-15 lung cancer cases were reported for every 1 lakh cancer patients. ""Of late, we have been getting about 13,000 new cases of cancer each year, of which 10% come in with lung cancer. And, 30% of lung cancer patients have nothing to do with smoking,"" he said./The Centre for Science and Environment says vehicular pollution has returned as a big threat in Delhi. ""About 55% of Delhiites stay within a 500m distance from main roads where vehicular pollution is at an all-time high. After public transport was converted to CNG, pollution has become invisible but is still on the rise,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, associate director, CSE./""In the 1990s, when the issue of air pollution was first raised, only particulate matter was being monitored. Now there is also a red alert on NOx and PM. AIIMS has been tracking hospital admissions and has found that they have been rising in winter months when pollution levels rise,"" Roychowdhury said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Bandhavgarh: Brick kilns pose a threat to wildlife, for real","INDORE: Wildlife in Bandhavgarh is facing a threat from brick kilns in Tala village, which serves as a buffer zone and a corridor for animals of the national park. Besides, the presence of kilns leads to loss of forests and agricultural land./Naturalist Satyendra Tiwari, who has been active in the Bandhavgarh National Park for over two decades, has urged Umaria collector to take action against brick kiln owners before a big damage to land and forests is caused there./In his petition, Tiwari alleges that the brick kilns, though a purely commercial venture, do not use commercial fuel, but firewood extracted from forests, on occasions in form of timber. ""I have seen the forests disappearing from the surroundings of Tala village over the years,"" he points out. The use of top soil of farm land makes land infertile, taking down agricultural produce yield against the need for greater production of food grains./Added to that, smoke billowing out of brick kilns contains carbon monoxide, which is more harmful than carbon dioxide to both the human and plant life. All fruit-bearing plants within the radius of 500 meters of any brick kiln see a major share of the crop. In the flowering season, bees and other insects stay away from the fruit bearing trees because of pollution caused due to heat. Brick kilns raise the temperature of the surroundings areas by 4-5 degrees./According to Tiwari, the sudden increase in temperature and constant blow of hot wind force insects that help in pollination to avoid these trees at a crucial time, impacting pollination and resulting in less production. This, he said, affects farmers directly. Tiwari has requested the collector to shift these kilns to some other place before May when the brick kiln season starts./Wildlife Conservation Trust Director Anish Andheria said, ""Apart from being one of the biggest sources of air pollution, brick kilns put pressure on both trees and soil, leading to an irreversible damage to the surrounding forests. The presence of brick kilns within the Tala village undoubtedly puts stress on Bandhavgarh and its tigers. The kilns also cause erosion thereby negatively influencing the hydrology of the landscape. Stringent steps must be taken to stop existing kilns and put a complete ban on construction of such units within 10 km from the tiger reserve boundary.""/Conservator of forest RK Pathak says ""Tala is a small village and residents are making bricks for their own use, I do not think it is on a large scale, but since you brought it to my notice I will see."" He added that they even use husk to prepare bricks and he would ensure that no timber was used in this process./CK Patil, park director says guidelines exist for declaration of eco-sensitive zones around the national parks and wildlife sanctuary, but it is not implemented yet. ""Since, it is in Tala village, which is not under my jurisdiction, I cannot take action against brick kilns owners,"" he said./When contacted, Umaria collector NS Bhatnagar, said he received a letter and asked SDO revenue to find out and appropriate action would be taken if any kind irregularity or harm to timber wood was found out./The first week of October is observed as the wildlife protection week. At present, there are more than 50 hotels and resorts around Bandhavgarh. In park around 50 tigers, a good number of chitals, sambhars, wild bores and leopards can be seen./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Assagao fire still troubles residents,"MAPUSA: The fire caused by burning of industrial waste on Assagao plateau was yet to die down on Wednesday evening even 48 hours after it had started. Sources said the site may have been regularly used for dumping toxic wastes. Smoke continued to rise from the burning waste and residents of Mapusa and Siolim are reeling from the toxic fumes. The fire is emitting a toxic smell and residents have complained of breathing and coughing problems. The fire also gutted a plantation in the vicinity. Residents have also complained to forest department regarding environmental damage. Bardez deputy collector Jayant Tari said, “It looks like it is industrial waste. I have directed the police to initiate necessary action to identify the culprits,” Tari said./Health officials inspect dump site/Miscreants had lit the fire on Monday evening on the plateau after dumping about three to four truckloads of waste, including plastic, thermocol, sponge and industrial waste./When TOI visited the site on Wednesday locals pointed out that the activity has been going on for long as around 300 sq m of area has been leveled and the quantity of waste dumped is huge. “It appears the fire was deliberately lit to reduce the waste to ashes and create space for new waste,” a local person said. Tari has also directed fire officials to monitor the situation and take action to douse the fire. Fire officials visited the site again on Wednesday and asked Mapusa municipality for labourers to cope with the task at hand. “We asked the municipality for labourers so that waste can be loosened and water splashed to put it off, if the fire doesn't come under control by Thursday morning,” Mapusa fire station in charge Dattaram Redkar said. Siolim primary health centre's health and sanitary officers inspected the site on Wednesday. They have sought action from Goa Sate Pollution Control Board (GSPCB)./“During the site inspection it has been seen that the waste dumped is still on fire and emitting thick smoke with acrid smell resulting in air pollution, therefore it is requested to kindly to look into the matter urgently and take necessary action,” the health department report to GSPCB states” I am not denying that smoke is emitted and is creating uneasiness for locals, however there is no immediate danger to the health of the public,” Siolim PHC health officer Chandrakant Parab said. GSPCB sources said they are looking into the matter. “We have already issued a show cause notice to MMC regarding the unscientific disposal of waste at the site,” an official said. The site of the fire is 300 metres away from it. Aggrieved villagers of Siolim, led by Xavier Fernandes, submitted a memorandum to, GSPCB, forest and health departments to take the matter seriously and act urgently./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Siolim fire: Govt agencies pass the buck,"MAPUSA: The six-day old fire fuelled by plastic and industrial wastes at Siolim-Assagao plateau refuses to die down, despite pouring of nearly 200 cubic metres of water over it. Sore over breathing toxic fumes, villagers alleged that authorities are ill-equipped to tackle such disasters./More than 25 fire tenders have been emptied at the site, but the smouldering fire only erupts again after deceptively subsiding for a few moments. Villagers from Siolim and nearby areas troupe to the site only to find that firemen and workers deputed by Mapusa municipal council are unable to extinguish the fire./""The disaster management authority (DMA) doesn't have resources to tackle disasters of this type,"" said Angelo Vaz, an activist from an NGO, My Siolim. Alleging lack of co-ordination between government agencies, other activists and villagers said the authorities have taken the issue too lightly while people are suffering unnecessarily./""If a JCB was pressed into service, some amount of leveling and covering it with mud would have helped to put it out faster,"" said Xavier Fernandes, another Siolim resident. But though the sub divisional magistrate had directed MMC to deploy an excavator to put out the fire, the council passed the buck, stating that they do not have a machine./Terming the Mapusa fire as Sonsoddo 2, Claude Alvares of Goa Foundation said a similar fire had raged at the Margao site for ten days. ""Finally, the disaster management authority had issued an emergency tender to get two contractors to pour mud over the raging fire,"" he said. Goa Foundation was managing the Sonsoddo site about three years back, but some unknown persons had set fire at the site in an act of sabotage, he alleged./""The firemen and labourers deputed by MMC are wasting their energy and risking their health,"" Fernandes said. Pointing out that they have been toiling at the site for five days, he said leveling of the dump with machinery would have achieved the purpose more efficiently./But Mapusa Municipal Council (MMC) sources said the site of the fire is not under their jurisdiction, and yet they are cooperating with authorities. ""But we don't have a machine to press into service,"" MMC chairperson Ashish Shirodkar said./However, additional collector Narayan Sawant said he would look into the matter. ""Any agency, be it private or government, has to provide the required machinery, as per the direction of the disaster management authority,"" he said./Alternately, the DMA can requisition machinery from PWD or other agencies, Sawan added./The sarpanch of the Siolim-Marna village panchayat, in whose jurisdiction the area comes, has expressed helplessness over the issue./""The waste has been dumped during late nights and it is extremely difficult to monitor it; the government should help us by providing guards to monitor dumping of the waste which is rampant in that area,"" sarpanch Vithal Salgaonkar said./""The villagers of Siolim had complained to me about the problem, I will convene a special meeting tomorrow (Sunday) to discuss the matter, and hopefully we will arrive at some solution because the health of villagers is at risk,"" he added./Blaming the government agencies for their slow approach, Seby Rodrigues, a social activist, said, ""The authorities should have taken samples of fumes for air pollution test; of the soil to check the type of wastes that are being burnt and also if ground water has been affected.""/The Goa state pollution control board (GSPCB) has conducted an inspection at the site, but a report compiled by officials is being processed./Though MMC has deputed five workers at the site, local residents said levelling the burning garbage manually is a difficult task. ""It is risky and unhealthy for them, as they are neither wearing masks nor is it possible to move the charred waste, almost embedded in the soil,"" Fernandes said./Armed with rakes, the five workers could manage to cover a small patch of the burning waste since Friday./The firemen routinely drive in, douse the fire for some time, refill the tender and return at the site. ""We monitor the situation and douse the fire whenever it suddenly breaks out in patches,"" a fireman said. Though some of them were wearing masks, they have also been exposed to the toxic fumes./""We are aware that dousing it with water is not the solution, but we are helpless,"" a fire official said. Villagers termed it as a waste of the precious commodity./The entire site with mounds of smouldering plastic and other waste throws up clouds of smoke throughout the day. Tightly packed in bags, it burns slowly, despite being treated with jets of water. Intermittently, small patches of garbage suddenly catch fire.

Activists unite for eco-friendly Diwali,"LUCKNOW: With Deepawali barely few days away, social activists are already on their toes to spread the message of 'Safe and Clean Diwali'. Many anti-cracker campaigns have kicked off in the city to spread awareness among the masses about the harmful effects of burning crackers./City-based pathologist, Dr PK Gupta like earlier years has already started promoting an eco-friendly Diwali. Together with other activists, the target this year is the students. ""We have used students as social messengers, who will be spreading a word of cautious among the people and highlight the side effects of burning crackers,"" said Gupta. The team would be visiting schools where during the assembly, students will be apprised of the health and environment hazards caused by burning crackers./As per him, burning crackers on Diwali night not only results in causing eye injuries, skin burns, but the gases emitted by burning the crackers such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon dioxide pollute the environment increasing the air pollution levels./The campaign will also sensitise people on the money that is wasted in burning the crackers. According to Dr Gupta, nearly Rs 20 crore is spent on crackers on Diwali, and around 1,500 metric tonne of waste is generated from burning the crackers./The students will be made aware of the Supreme Court ruling, which prohibits burning crackers in around 100 metres radius of hospitals, religious places and court. They will also spread the message that burning of crackers after 10.00 pm causes trouble to patients of asthma, bronchitis and other chest problems as the smoke level goes up. ""Every citizen has a right to sleep and burning of crackers late night hampers the sleep of people especially elderly citizens,"" said Dr Gupta./Traders' associations will be motivated to get away with the business of crackers. Students will carry placards for a safe and clean Diwali and urge the people to refrain themselves from burning the crackers.

Changing weather causes spurt in respiratory diseases,"VARANASI: Dust and smoke, two of the major allergens responsible for aggravating respiratory diseases, are fast turning out to be a menace in the city. Various government hospitals, including Sir Sunder Lal (SSL) Hospital, BHU, have started witnessing increase in respiratory ailments, including allergic asthma and bronchitis. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are also finding the conditions difficult to tackle. To add to their woes, the Ganga Pollution Control Unit (GPCU) of Jal Nigam also started the digging of roads to lay stormwater drainage pipeline on Sunday./As per reports of the OPD of department of chest and respiratory diseases, BHU, there has been an average increase of 20% in patient turnout for respiratory diseases in the past fortnight (since October 1). Against the average turnout of around 150 patients a day, the department has started to witness around 180 patients a day these days. Similarly, reports of DDU Hospital and SPG Divisional Hospital also indicate a spurt of nearly 15% in cases of respiratory diseases with heavy turnout of patients at the OPD./As per J K Samaria of department of respiratory diseases, BHU, and secretary, Indian Chest Society (ICS), the post monsoon season marks increased presence of various allergens, including dust and pollens. This puts young children and elderly people under higher risk. Those already suffering from bronchitis or other lung diseases need to be extra careful as the cases may aggravate into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Saying that the concentration of air pollutants also remains high during the festive season, he emphasises that the high concentration of dust particles caused by digging of trenches along the roads for various developmental projects adds to the woes in the city. It may be mentioned here that heavy and incessant rainfall during monsoon season has not only damaged a large number of roads but the dust particles that have settled on these roads have now started to fly and mix with air. In addition, heavy traffic load with ever-increasing movement of smoke-emitting vehicles is enough to aggravate respiratory diseases./Reports from GPCU under Jal Nigam indicate that the work of digging trenches to lay stormwater drainage pipeline (part of ambitious Rs 192 cr mega project under JNNURM) has started at Pishachmochan, Badi Gaibi and Samneghat. The work would witness digging of trenches (three-metre to six-metre deep) and construction agency would simultaneously start construction and repair of road, immediately after the pipe is laid./Take care not to inhale dust particles : The health experts are coming up with tips to tackle respiratory diseases. According to J K Samaria of department of respiratory diseases, BHU, and secretary, Indian Chest Society (ICS), one needs to be alert and take preventive measures, especially during changing season (post-monsoon). ""If possible, the face or at least the nostrils should be covered to avoid inhaling dust. The elderly people and infants should remain indoors to avoid the risk of respiratory diseases,"" he said./The chest physicians are coming up with suggestive measures, including curbing smoking and reducing air pollution beside maintaining a balanced diet and regular exercise to improve lung health.

It is also pertinent that asthma patients remain well-prepared with inhalers and adhere to their prescribed medicine strictly. Air pollution also leads to development of symptoms like coughing, wheezing and breathlessness even in healthy people so they should also stay careful,"" he said./Gaseous air-pollutants emitted from firecrackers aggravate the risk of an attack in asthmatics./Such pollutants also have the potential to cause new cases of asthma. Crackers are one of the provoking factors for childhood bronchial asthma, particularly in children between 6-12 years and it has now been established that 26% of people without any prior history of respiratory ailments develop symptoms of coughing, wheezing and breathlessness especially during Diwali./The reason is that crackers contain 75% potassium nitrate, 15% carbon and 10% sulphur and when they are burnt, harmful gases such as sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, manganese and even cadmium are released, which irritate the delicate airways of lungs and worsen the condition of people with pulmonary diseases./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

People should avoid early-morning and late-night walks as the air is more polluted and also smoggy air increases difficulties for asthma patients,” said Dr Ravindra Mehta, pulmonologist, Fortis Hospital./Air pollution when combined with rain can lead to acid rain, which can be harmful for those who suffer from asthma and bronchitis . “Rain combines with pollution and causes allergies like cold, cough, breathing problems and skin irritation ,” said Dr Padma Sundaram, consultant pulmonologist, Manipal Hospital./Dr H Paramesh, director and peadiatric pulmonologist, Lakeside Medical Centre and Hospital, said: “The air pollution slowly comes down once winter sets in. But rain combining with pollution during Diwali makes it difficult for people who are allergic to air pollution.”/The best way to avoid getting cold and cough these days is to cover yourself well. “People should keep away from fumes and dust. If your home has a carpet or office has wall-to-wall carpet, it’s necessary to keep it clean. Carpeted rooms can be a cause of allergy because they are the best carriers of dust mites,” said Dr Dwijenda Prasad, consultant, internal medicine, BGS Global Hospital./How sulphur dioxide affects you health/Sulphur dioxide, one of the main components of fireworks, stimulates nerves in the lining of the nose and throat and lungs’ airways This causes a reflex cough, irritation, and a feeling of chest tightness, which may lead to narrowing of airways This is particularly likely to occur in people suffering from asthma and chronic lung disease, whose airways are often inflamed and easily irritated./Asthma patients are generally considered most sensitive to concentrations of SO/Exercise enthusiasts are sensitive to it. This is because the gas is very reactive and consequently distribution along conductive airways of respiratory tract is non-uniform , depending on breathing volumes and types For nasal breathing with low to moderate volumes, the penetration into lungs is negligible. For oral inhalation and larger volumes, doses may reach the segmental bronchi./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Haze in Delhi sets off air pollution alarm,"NEW DELHI: A thick haze over Delhi on Friday has set the alarm bells ringing over growing air pollution in the city. While pollution normally rises during winter, Friday’s level at places was more than 10 times the prescribed limits./For instance, levels of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), the prescribed standard for which is 80 micrograms/cubic metre, were 811 and 760, respectively, at R K Puram and Punjabi Bagh at 7pm. Experts said usually such high pollution levels are not seen till later in the season./“About 80% of NOx and NO2 come from vehicles. At 7pm, when shockingly high levels of NOx were recorded, Delhi normally witnesses its highest traffic movement. The PM2.5 level at 5 pm was also almost seven times the prescribed levels and this is very worrying,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, director of Centre for Science and Environment’s clean air programme./The Met department gave two main reasons for the pollution haze. “The wind has been unusually calm because of which pollutants have remained suspended in the lower atmosphere. Moisture has also been building up due to a western disturbance over J&K because of which humidity is high. Water molecules act as a nucleus for pollutants” said R K Jenamani, director in-charge, IGI Met./In another couple of days, both fog and haze will lift as a low-level wind is showing signs of strengthening./Environmentalists have been raising the red flag over air pollution in Delhi, especially due to a profusion of vehicles and Friday's haze only support their arguments. ""Particulate matter levels have become a major problem for Delhi but this time we are witnessing a cocktail of deadly pollutants,"" said Roychowdhury./The system for air quality forecasting and research which records pollution levels on a scale of 0-500 based on their health impacts indicated very unhealthy levels of both PM 2.5 and PM 10 for Delhi University at 405 and 476 respectively. Noida too recorded very unhealthy levels of both pollutants at 466 and 443. At Ayanagar, PM 2.5 was at 407 and PM 10 at 388. At all other locations, the levels of PM were poor, if not worse./Pollution levels rise in winter due to a lowering of the inversion level. While warm air tends to rise and disperse pollutants, in winter the air near the surface is cooler than the air above and does not rise. Due to this pollutants tend to remain packed within a smaller area./CNG benefits fade/Along with a rising number of vehicles, Delhi is also dealing with massive dust due to construction activities and a failed effort to control burning of garbage and leaves. Experts say benefits of converting to CNG have practically disappeared and conditions are only likely to worsen in the coming years if the government doesn't mediate. A rise in diesel vehicles also does not help./Environment secretary Keshav Chandra said the department was working on a comprehensive policy on PM levels. ""We are working at promoting public transport. Levels of NOx are expectedly high during evening hours but it would require us to study the problem further,"" he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Vroom boom adds pollutants to Lucknow's air,"LUCKNOW: The ambient air quality of Lucknow is on a decline. Compared to previous years, concentration of gaseous pollutants and respirable fine particles has increased in the air, at least at 10 locations which IITR monitored, as part of its annual post-monsoon environment assessment in October 2011./Stating that vehicular traffic is the main source of particulate air pollution in the city, SC Barman, scientist at IITR said, “It is the increasing number of vehicles, which is to be blamed for this.” Encroachment, traffic congestion, vehicles moving at a speed less than the optimum level and footpath-dust are the other factors leading to surge in air pollution level. Since, Lucknow does not have any major industrial activity, tremendous increase in number of vehicles is one of the biggest reasons for rising air pollution./The Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR) celebrated its 46th Foundation Day on Friday. The environment assessment report released on the occasion showed rising pollution levels for residential, commercial and industrial areas./The Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) level at 10 monitoring locations was higher than the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The same was true in case of finer particles./Tail pipe emission from vehicles and re-suspension of dust are major sources of air pollutants like RSPM, trace metals and gases. The respirable particles are responsible for cardiovascular as well as respiratory diseases, as these particles can penetrate deep into respiratory system. Smaller the size of the particle, more harmful it is./Cleanliness and maintenance of roads, weather, type of fuel and vehicle used, population density, driving habits and topographical infl uence of the area are some of the factors contributing to the increase in fi ne particles and RSPM. Scientists are of the opinion that it is the composition of pollution, which has changed over years while the problem still remains more or less the same./The report also stated that traffic noise has become a major environmental concern in urban areas with high traffi c congestion. Sources of noise in urban areas are primarily vehicular engines, exhaust systems, aerodynamic friction and tyre-pavement interaction. Traffic noise is affected by factors like traffic volume and speed, vehicle mix, pavement type and condition of the vehicles./Times View/The air quality in Lucknow has deteriorated and, as the IITR survey says, vehicular pollution is the single-most factor behind it. Fuel prices may be hitting the roof, but that has hardly played a deterrent as far as its consumption is concerned. The number of vehicles has gone up 13% in the city and the sale of fuel by 10% in the past one year./Clearly, in the absence of an organized public transport system, the number of people using personalized vehicles is growing rapidly. And this number will continue to grow until people driving their own cars to commute fi nd city buses good enough to travel in. The low-fl oor city buses introduced under the JNNURM are so few that they are not able to cater to more than a couple of routes. Besides, the city has no taxi service. While the Metro, if it materializes at all, will take another 10 years to get operational, revamping of public transport system is the only way to cut emission./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Chemical unit makes life miserable for Lake Town residents,"KOLKATA: From 1962, residents of a part of Lake Town are bearing with a torture of sorts. West Bengal Chemical Industries Ltd, a chemical company, opened in that year and ever since, the residents around the factory are living in a ""polluted"" environment. It has also been alleged that the company has made life miserable for patients in the locality./The West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) in January this year had come up with instruction that the factory should submit time-bound programme to shift to elsewhere, but factory officials claim their operations are being conducted as per guidelines laid down by the WBPCB./The company, which manufactures chemical compounds for medicines, was taken over by the government in 2005 and is now run as a joint venture company. On November 10, 2010, the WBPCB finally took cognizance of the complaints and after several inspections had served a closure notice for operating without adopting proper pollution control measures. Thereafter, the factory was closed down for 40 days. In January, 2011, it was allowed to resume operations after an inspection revealed that it had adopted measures to minimize air pollution and set up an effluent treatment plant as per the Board's directions./In the same month, the WBPCB issued a fresh directive stating that it would have to submit a time-bound programme for shifting its activities from the present location. The directive further stated that under no circumstances should the factory continue its operations at that location beyond three months from January, without prior permission from WBPCB./However, the WBPCB carried out another inspection last week after receiving complaints from the South Dum Dum Municipality. ""We carried out two inspections recently. The report should be out in a day or two,"" said WBPCB chairman Binay Kanti Dutta./Residents, however, are not keen to spend any more time in such unhealthy surroundings. ""We were relieved last year after the factory closed down. We thought our misery has finally ended. Now, things have gone back to what it was earlier. The factory emits a strong obnoxious smell that we have to bear with throughout the day. It only gets stronger after dusk. The machines inside also create a terrible noise throughout the day,"" said Sekhar Roy Chaudhury./There are some who are suffering from serious respiratory trouble and they complain that the smell has turned their lives miserable. ""It's a very strong smell and I am getting badly affected. I am already suffering from respiratory problems,"" said elderly resident Bijon Kumar Saha./For people like 69-year-old Sumitra Devi Arya, it is like living in hell. She has to be administered Oxygen 24-hours a day due to interstitial lung disease. ""My mother's room is just adjacent to the factory and the windows have to be kept open at all times. The smell is unbearable for her,"" said her son Chaturesh Arya./Factory general manager (operations) Surojit Kumar Paul claimed that all WBPCB norms are being complied with. ""It's true that there were problems last year but since then, we have been following all environmental norms according to WBPCB instructions. In fact, we stopped using butyric acid completely. If pollution levels are so high, how can the trees survive inside the complex? Contrary to what is being said, we have about 200 employees and none of them have ever complained. This factory also has the approval of Current Good Manufacturing Practices,"" Paul insisted./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Mosquito coils can cause COPD,"<p>/VARANASI: While primary cause of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is believed to be tobacco smoke world over, in a survey conducted recently it has been found that COPD cases in India among the non-smokers are more than among smokers.</p>/<p>/""The survey was conducted in India recently and this data comes as a shocking surprise as it is contrary to rest of the world,"" said JK Samaria, professor and senior consultant, department of chest diseases, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University (BHU).</p>/<p>/Samaria, also the honorary secretary of the Indian Chest Society, said the data caused more concern due to the fact that the non-smokers hardly ever realised that they might develop a lethal disease like COPD. ""Even the use of mosquito coils can cause COPD,"" he said.</p>/<p>/""The American College of Chest Physicians and Indian Chest Society are seriously concerned about the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COPD by means of spreading awareness and education of the general public and medical fraternity about the disease,"" said Samaria. He is also the international governor (India) of American College of Chest Diseases. According to him, the society is continuously performing training and research activities to minimise the impact of the disease. In continuation to this, the Indian Chest Society is going to organise a workshop on the Spirometry for training of physicians at 24 centres across the country on the occasion of World COPD Day on November 16 (Wednesday).</p>/<p>/Besides Indian Chest Society, a centre of chest care in association with Indian Medical Association (IMA) will also arrange a free mobile check up van on the occasion. The van will cross through various localities of the city for free check up of COPD patients.</p>/<p>/The World COPD Day is a global effort to expand understanding of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and advocate for better care for patients. According to the report of World Health Organisation (WHO), in 2004, 64 million people had the illness and WHO predicts that COPD will become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030. Key risk factors for COPD are tobacco smoking, indoor and outdoor air pollution, and exposure to occupational dusts and chemicals.</p>/<p>/According to Samaria, COPD is a disease appearing similar to asthma, but it is more lethal and different from asthma. The COPD is characterized by prolonged cough with excess sputum production and breathlessness. Initially the breathlessness is observed after light work-out but gradually it may occur even while sitting idle as well. The breathlessness caused due to asthma can be cured after proper medication, but unfortunately same is not the case with COPD. The patient of COPD is never cured completely.</p>/<p>/He said that COPD is the fourth largest cause of mortality in America. In India, however, clear data is not available but it is suspected that the COPD may be one of the major causes of mortality here as well.</p>/<p>/""A survey conducted in 2010 at various centres of the country revealed the fact that there were over 50 million COPD patients in India,"" he said and added the prevalence of COPD in non-smoking female patients was quite significant. The ratio of male to female COPD patients is as high as 1.5:1 in India.</p>/<p>/""According to a report from WHO, more than 90% of COPD mortality involves poor countries with people having lower per capita income,"" he said and added that in India the COPD among the rural females was a major cause of concern.</p>/<p>/Among these females cooking on cow dung and wooden fire is one of the major causes of COPD. According to him, two billion kg of biomass fuel is burnt every day world over producing 25 million liters of polluted air affecting 3000 million people across the world. The COPD spreads rapidly among people living in rural and semi-urban localities due to use of kerosene stoves for cooking, lack of proper ventilation and usage of mosquito coils. Atmospheric pollution is yet another major cause of COPD and increasing quantum of automobiles and pollution due to their exhaust is making the thing the worst.</p>/<p>/Samaria said that COPD might not be completely cured with available drugs today, but proper education and awareness about the disease could surely help to reduce its occurrence.</p>/<p>/Quitting smoking, use of pollution free means of cooking, proper ventilation in the houses are few measures that may lower the risk of COPD significantly.</p>/<p>/""Use of pollution mask daily before going out-door can also be useful to prevent pollution due to automobile exhaust,"" he suggested and added to diagnose the disease early and reduce its impact, spirometry was a useful and reliable test.</p>/<p>/This test is available at BHU hospital and other selected centres in the city.</p>/<p>/<meta content=""cms.next"" name=""cmsei"" />/</p>/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Delhi four times more polluted than Pune on Diwali night,"PUNE: Air pollution caused by firecrackers had crossed the permissible limits in the city during this year's Diwali. However, Pune is found to be much better compared to Delhi, where pollution level was found to be four times higher than that in Pune during the same period.The air quality monitoring, carried out by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) here shows that the pollutants - particulate matter PM 2.5 and PM 10 - crossed the permissible limit in the city. The level of PM 2.5 crossed 90 ug/m3 (micrograms per cubic metre) on October 26, whereas the permissible limit (National Ambient Air Quality Standards) is 60 ug/m3. The level of PM10 was more than 125 ug/m3 on October 26 and 27, while the permissible limit was 100 ug/m3./On October 26, the PM 10 level in Delhi was 527.53 ug/m3, and the PM 2.5 level was 335.27 ug/m3. Gufran Beig, programme director and scientist at the IITM, told TOI that PM 2.5 and PM 10 are fine particles which are airborne pollutants and can easily be inhaled without the person even noticing it. It is dangerous for health, particularly for people suffering from asthma and upper respiratory diseases and for infants and the elderly people.The finding shows that, on 24-hour basis, PM 2.5 level crossed the permissible limit with 90 ug/m3 on October 26 and with 83 ug/m3 on October 27. On an hourly basis, the PM 2.5 level was above 450 ug/m3 at 11 pm on October 26. Such a high level is very unhealthy and dangerous.Beig said that PM 2.5 are particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers. The smaller and lighter a particle is, the longer it will stay in the air.Similarly, the PM 10 level was more than 125 ug/m3 (permissible limit 100 ug/m3) on a 24-hour basis on October 26 and 27. On an hourly basis, the level was above 550 ug/m3 on both the days. A small exposure of this pollutant can be harmful for people suffering from asthma or respiratory ailments. It can cause wheezing and coughing and lead to heart attack, Beig said./In case of nitrogen dioxide level, on a 24-hour basis, the concentration of nitrogen oxide crossed 20 ppb (parts per billion) on October 26 against a permissible limit of 42 ppb. Whereas, on an hourly basis, it touched 100 ppb for two hours around midnight between October 26 and 27.Beig said that nitrogen oxide causes nose and eye irritation and can lead to lung tissue damage. It aggravates heart diseases also.The pollution level in Pune was less compared to Delhi and the reason could be public awareness or the quality of crackers used here, Beig said. Smoke discharge is less in case of better quality crackers, he added.""The air pollution in Pune was almost the same as last year. But, in Delhi, it was much less than that of last year. One reason behind the reduced pollution level could be the awareness drive through school students and social organisations. Another reason could be the colder temperature last year as Diwali was on November 5. During such periods, the atmospheric boundary layer (the lowest part of the atmosphere) is lower and traps pollutants,"" Beig said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"8% of people in Mumbai, Thane hit by COPD","In The Emperor of All Maladies : A Biography of Cancer, oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee brought to the fore a disease that society and the medical world are still grappling with. But there is another disease that claims more lives than cancer; considered as dangerous as AIDS, its fatality rate is surpassed only by heart attacks, strokes and acute lung infections-Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)./Described as a slow killer, COPD is fast emerging as an epidemic , affecting eight out of 100 people living in Mumbai and Thane district . The results of a city-based study show that the percentage of Mumbaikars and Thaneites suffering from COPD is much higher than the all-India figure of 4.1%. The culprit , say doctors, is smoking./Researchers at the Indian Institute of Environmental Medicine (IIEM) put the urban and rural prevalence of COPD at 7-8 %./The most common cause of COPD is smoking. ""Around 90% of people who smoke risk the chance of developing COPD,"" said IIEM director Dr Rohini Chowghule, a chest specialist who conducted the study on 500 men and 500 women above the age of 35 years./Though the study reflected 2006 figures, city doctors say the incidence rate would have only increased in the last few years./One reason, say doctors, for the higher prevalence of COPD in Mumbai is the massive population. ""There is a bigger population in the city, especially of those who smoke-actively as well as passively. This is the reason more people suffer from respiratory problems,"" said Dr Ashok Mahasur, a chest specialist with Hinduja Hospital. ""Another problem is the environmental pollution in the city. Many Mumbaikars have occupational exposure to pollution and end up falling prey to COPD,"" he said, adding that if repeated respiratory infections during childhood are not treated, they too can become COPD at a later age./""For a long time, there are no visible effects of smoking. But over a period of time, the tubes of the air ways get inflamed. The person gets bronchitis, which is still reversible . If, however, the person continues to smoke, then the alveoli, which are tiny air sacs in the lungs, start getting damaged,"" said Chowghule. There are about 300 million alveoli in two adult lungs and provide a surface area almost equal to the singles area of a tennis court. But with COPD, the elasticity of the alveoli is lost. The walls of the air sacs break, thus reducing the capacity and the surface area. ""The air is trapped in these damaged alveoli. There is stale air in the lungs and one has to strain to breathe,"" said Chowghule./Biomass fuel is a health hazard/Another worrying aspect, say doctors, is the prevalence of COPD among women who don't smoke. Studies show that women who have to use biomass fuel for cooking purposes are more prone to COPD. Dr Amita Athavale, head of the chest department at KEM Hospital, said: ""It is not just a rural phenomenon. Even women in Mumbai slums and pavements use this technique for cooking purposes."" According to doctors, the morbidity is higher and gradual among women who use biomass fuel. ""In the course of the disease, there comes a time when they cannot perform the most basic household chores and have to strain the abdominal and neck muscles to breathe. It is important that women are taught to maintain smokeless chulhas so that they don't fall prey to COPD at a later age,"" said Athavale./WHAT IS COPD?/Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD is a chronic obstruction of the flow of air through the airways and out of the lungs. The obstruction is usually permanent and progressivethe disease gets worse over time/CAUSES/CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SECOND-HAND SMOKE/Smoking is responsible for 90% of COPD cases. When a COPD patient stops smoking, the decline in lung function slows to the same rate as a non-smoker/AIR POLLUTION/It can cause problems for people with a lung disease, but it is unclear whether outdoor air pollution contributes to the development of COPD. In the nonindustrialized world, the most common cause of COPD is indoor air pollution, usually due to indoor stoves used for cooking/OCCUPATIONAL POLLUTANTS/Some occupational pollutants such as cadmium and silica do increase the risk of COPD. People at risk include coal miners, construction, metal and cotton workers/SYMPTOMS/COPD symptoms usually slowly worsen over time. Over time, symptoms may become severe enough to see a doctor/Typically, after smoking 20 or more cigarettes a day for more than twenty years, patients with COPD develop a chronic cough, shortness of breath (dyspnoea), and frequent respiratory infections Chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis symptomschronic cough and sputum production-are telling signs Periodic chest infections can cause fever, dyspnoea, coughing, production of purulent (cloudy and discoloured) sputum and wheezing/ADVANCED COPD SYMPTOMS/Patients may develop cyanosisbluish discoloration of the lips and nail beds-due to a lack of oxygen in blood They also may develop morning headaches due to the inability to remove carbon dioxide from the blood Some patients experience weight loss, primarily because of the additional energy that is required to breathe.

Prevent inhaling dust to keep respiratory diseases at bay,"KANPUR: With winter season, cases of asthma and other respiratory disorders also rise./Saying that winter can spell trouble for people who are suffering from lung diseases, medical experts have asked patients to be careful and stay in touch with their doctors./If chest experts are to be believed, asthma aggravates to some extent during winters, especially when the weather is foggy. ""This mainly happens due to the particulate matter in smog that triggers asthma in individuals allergic to it,"" said Anil Nigam, chest specialist at Ursula Horsman Hospital./Adding that change of seasons also worsens the medical condition of those suffering from asthma, Nigam points out that sudden variations in temperatures during changing seasons are critical to children as well. It is important to mention here that as per the outpatient records of the district hospitals, the chest specialists are observing nearly 50 to 70 patients everyday. Also, among all the patients, at least 30% are children./Doctors further claimed that dust and smoke are the two major allergens responsible for aggravating respiratory diseases which are fast turning out to be a menace in the city. Various government hospitals including Lala Lajpta Rai hospital have started witnessing increase in respiratory ailments, including allergic asthma and bronchitis./Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are also finding the conditions difficult to tackle. To add to their woes, the ongoing digging work under Jawharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) is adding dust to environment./As per reports of the OPD of department of chest and respiratory diseases, at LLR there has been an average increase of 20% in patient turnout for respiratory diseases in the past fortnight (since November 20). Against the average turnout of around 80 to 90 patients per day, the department has started to witness more than 150 patients a day these days./Similarly, reports of UHM Hospital and Kamlapat Memorial Hospital also indicate a spurt of nearly 15% in cases of respiratory diseases with heavy turnout of patients at the OPD./RP Singh, head of department of chest and respiratory diseases at LLR, informs that the post-monsoon season marks increased presence of various allergens, including dust and pollens. This puts young children and elderly people under higher risk./""Those already suffering from bronchitis or other lung diseases need to be extra careful as the cases may aggravate into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"" added Sharma./He goes on to add that the concentration of air pollutants also remains high during the festive and marriage season and says the high concentration of dust particles caused by digging of trenches along the roads for various developmental projects adds to the woes in the city./It may be mentioned here that heavy and incessant rainfall during monsoon season has not only damaged a number of roads but the dust particles that have settled on these roads have now started to fly and mix with air. In addition, heavy traffic load with ever-increasing movement of smoke-emitting vehicles is enough to aggravate respiratory diseases./""If possible, face, or at least the nostrils, should be covered to avoid inhaling dust. The elderly people and infants should remain indoors to avoid the risk of respiratory diseases,"" said DK Vaishya , chest specialism at UHM./The chest physicians are coming up with suggestive measures, including curbing smoking and reducing air pollution besides maintaining a balanced diet and regular exercise to improve lung health. Most of them feel that keeping a close vigil on allergens and taking measures to avoid them could ensure better lung health during the season./The experts also suggest spirometry test (a quick breathing test for getting early signs and diagnosis of lung diseases) for reducing the risk of lung diseases in the season./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Rise in lung cancer cases worries docs,"NAGPUR: Incidence of lung cancer that has always been the most deadly form of the disease are on the rise in Central India. More than 3% people affected by cancer suffer from it at present as opposed to 2% until just a couple of years back./This startling fact came to light in a recent study undertaken by Rashtrasant Tukdoji Regional Cancer Hospital, one of the 27 regional cancer hospitals in the country. The hospital has been keeping a track of cancer patients in the region since the last ten years. They are specifically observing the incidence of lung cancer for the past few years./""Globally lung cancer causes most cancer related deaths. Until recently, its incidence was not very high in India. However, in the last couple of years there has been a steady rise in the cases,"" informed Dr Shantanu Chaudhari, director of RSTRCH. He added that the scenario was the same in most developing countries./Dr BK Sharma, joint director of the hospital, said, ""this is one form of cancer that can be cautioned against since most people acquire it through smoking. Ninety percent of the males and 83 percent females get the disease because of smoking.""/The risk of developing cancer among smokers is proportional to consumption and duration they have been smoking, informed Dr SB Sapre, medical superintendent of the hospital. ""For example, compared to non-smokers those who consume up to 14 cigarettes a day are eight times more likely to die of lung cancer and those who smoke 25 or more sticks a day are 25 times more likely to do so,"" he explained./Another causative agent of lung cancer is radon, a radioactive gas found in abundance in uranium mines. ""Radon is also present in high amounts in cities as it is a naturally occurring gas even inside homes and offices. In fact, a study has found that around 9% cases of lung cancer in Europe can be ascribed to indoor exposure to radon,"" said oncosurgeon Dr Prasanaa Joshi. Other factors that can be responsible for the disease include occupational exposure to carcinogens, indoor air pollution, alcohol, family history and previous cancer treatment./Though early detection helps in treatment, many factors often delay the detection. ""Many symptoms that may warn people of the presence of lung cancer, like cough, weight loss and anorexia are also experienced in tuberculosis. TB being a much prevalent infection in India, many times patients are treated for it before it is found that they are suffering from lung cancer. Long bouts of cough, therefore, necessitate the patients to be screened for lung cancer to be on the safer side,"" said oncologist Dr Pranay Taori./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Bird flu battle begins in state,"BHUBANESWAR: Mass culling of poultry birds began in Khurda district's Keranga area on Thursday. The move followed a central directive to Odisha to go ahead with the exercise to prevent the spread of avian influenza in the area, which is home to hundreds of domesticated fowls and a huge poultry farm./Around 4,000 broiler chickens and thousands of eggs were buried near the private farm on day one. Spread over nearly 15 acre, the farm housed nearly 28,000 broiler birds. In total, the government plans to kill around 35,000 poultry birds in Keranga area./""Ten rapid reaction teams (RRT), including veterinarians, were involved in the culling exercise. It will continue till all poultry fowls in 19 villages within a 3-km radius from Keranga, the epicentre of the dreaded disease, are killed,"" said fisheries and animal resources development secretary Satyabrat Sahu./Two RRTs comprising 15 trained veterinarians and forest officers were engaged to cull the birds at the private farm. ""This was the biggest poultry farm in the area. We buried the culled birds as per the standard protocol and safety measures,"" Dr Sanjeet Kumar, nodal officer of the exercise, told TOI./There are a couple of other small poultry farms in the vicinity. ""We will soon move out to the 19 villages and cull domesticated birds. Villagers were asked to cooperate with us,"" said Kumar, an Indian Forest Service officer./Two pits, each 13 feet deep were created inside on the sprawling farm campus to bury the birds./""We have imposed a three-month restriction on the raising of poultry birds in Keranga area. And the pits will not be opened up for the next five years,"" Khurda district collector Roopa Mishra said. ""Once the culling process is over, we would start doling out compensation announced by the government,"" she added./Earlier, tension prevailed at the culling site as the officers reached late to start the exercise. The villagers, who demolished portion of a boundary wall of the farm, razed down other concrete fences, notwithstanding heavy police deployment./The Keranga residents, many of whom are in police and military services, urged the collector to ban poultry farming in the area. ""Air pollution went up ever since the poultry raising started in the farm eight months ago. Population of deleterious insects such as flies has gone up, spreading pollution in nearby villages,"" Idrish Khan, a villager said. Five other villages with a population of nearly 4,000, surround Keranga village./The villagers are livid that the poultry farm led to the death of a number of chickens, hens and ducks in the vicinity. ""Not less than 400 poultry birds died in the last 10 days. We suspect the birds died of avian influenza, which originated from the farm,"" Sheikh Nasim, another villager said./The collector said: ""I will look into the demand of the villagers.""/Nodal officer of fisheries and animal resources department Gopal Tripathy denied of receiving fresh positive bird flu cases in Odisha on Thursday. A hen, a duck and a crow were found carrying the fatal H5N1 virus recently, sources said. ""So far no human being has been affected by the bird flu virus,"" Tripathy added./The government stopped movement of poultry products into Keranga, thus depriving schoolchildren of eggs under the Midday Meal Scheme there./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Something in the air here,"It’s the time of the year when people with respiratory problems queue up outside clinics thanks to higher levels of particulate matter and toxic gases in the air. Tamil Nadu pollution control board (TNPCB) officials say they have a tough task ahead — to prevent and monitor burning of tyres and plastic on Bhogi Saturday./This year, their job is doubly difficult as there are five more wards to monitor following the expansion of the city last year. The pollution control board has 15 corporation zones to cover — from Sholinganallur to Manali./Last year, air pollution on Bhogi day was monitored at nine locations. Traditionally, families discard old possessions on Bhogi which precedes Pongal. But burning of old tyres and plastic vessels has led to low visibility and high pollution./The permissible limit for nitrogen oxide and sulphur dioxide in the air is 80ppm (parts per million). Respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) should not exceed 100 micro gram per cubic metre while total suspended particulate matter (TSPM) should be below 200 micro gram per cubic metre. On Bhogi day, the levels go up mainfold./Asthma expert Dr R Sridharan says his regular patients have been adequately warned about the problems to expect during this season. “But there will be many new patients who begin wheezing during this time of the year. Some of them get well after medication but for many it will become a chronic infection,” he said./Several general physicians have prescribed flu shots for their patients as influenza can lead to obstruction of the airway, thereby causing respiratory problems. “The weather is changing. Flu shots can help reduce respiratory diseases,” Sridharan said./TNPCB deputy director P V Marimuthu says the board has taken measures to cover the extended city. “We are also conducting awareness programmes and campaigns to discourage the public from burning tyres and plastic products. We have identified 15 major locations including those in newly-added areas for pollution monitoring,” he said./Tiruvottiyur, Ambattur and Perungudi are among the new areas to be monitored. TNPCB plans to organize street plays prior to Bhogi to spread awareness about pollution prevention. “Over the years, our awareness campaigns have proved effective as fewer people have been found burning tyres during Bhogi,” Marimuthu said./The board has five ambient air quality centres in the city — in Anna Nagar, Adyar, Kilpauk, T Nagar and Vallalar Nagar. During festivals, the board deploys mobile units for air quality sampling. This year, our task is to monitor areas in the suburbs too. Pollution levels during Bhogi are generally high in Ambattur, Manali, Perambur, Pallavaram and Tambaram,” said Marimuthu./TNPCB has been monitoring air quality on Bhogi days since 2001./BREATHING IN POLLUTANTS/The day preceding Pongal is known as Bhogi. On this day, people gather at dawn, light a bonfire and discard old articles. But increasing instances of burning tyres and plastic materials have led to accumulation of carbon monoxide and suspended particulate matter in the air Burning of tyres and plastic leads to emission of carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen, dioxins and toxic fumes Carbon monoxide reduces oxygencarrying capacity of blood cells. Sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen can cause respiratory problems, dizziness, metabolic disorders and cancer Suspended particulate matter results in smog under humid conditions. This can cause road accidents and disrupt air traffic due to poor visibility./TIMES VIEW/Ringing out the old and ringing in the new are part of civilizations, old and young. Bhogi, when people discard old things, is such a ritual. Burning one’s mattress, footwear or old clothes in the open would have been OK till there was open space and these articles were mostly made of natural materials. Urbanisation has shrunk our personal space and brought along with it synthetic household articles which, when burned, add to the already dangerous levels of pollution. There is precious little the pollution control board can do when people burn rubber and plastic in the name of tradition. If you have to throw out something this bhogi, let it be the polluting habit./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Some smile, some choke on Bhogi","CHENNAI: Some neighbourhoods in the city celebrated Bhogi responsibly, keeping pollution levels low, while some others threw awareness messages to the air and burned discarded materials, contributing to the smog cover./Residents of Adyar and Royapuram saw a decrease in air pollution compared to last Bhogi, but in places like Perungudi andAnna Nagar,the respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) was double the permissible limit of 100 microgram/ cubic metre. The average RSPM level in the city during the 24-hour period on Saturday was 142 against 129 last year and 128 in 2010./Three international flights coming in to land at Meenambakkam airport had to be diverted to other airports due to low visibility. Bhogi smoke reduced visibility to about 500 metres at the airport. “Runway visibility remained between 500 metres and700 metresfor an hour,” said airport metdirector R Suresh. Visibility remained low on roads and railway lines butdidn’t affect vehicle traffic./Perungudi, where one of the two big dumpyards is located, RSPM count touched 232 on Saturday against 48 on Friday. Tondiarpet and Kilpauk registered RSPM counts of 246 and 228 on Saturday, but they were only about 20 counts above that of the previous day. The pollution control board said pollution levels have remained high in these partseven beforeBhogi because of metro rail and bridge works. Madhavaram, T Nagar andVirugambakkam also registeredhigh pollution levels. Adyar registered lowest RSPM level (61), followed by Thiruvotriyur (69) and Sholinganallur (80)./A senior officialwiththe regional meteorological department said the below average minimum temperature added to the smog. The overall status of gaseous pollutants like sulphur-dioxide (SO2) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx)werefoundto be within permissible limits. TNPCB checked ambient air quality at 15 locations before and after Bhogi./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"NO2 levels over India increasing, says data","PUNE: The satellite data of tropospheric pollution over Asia shows that there has been a rise in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) level over India and China. It is due to usage of more fossil fuel. At the same time, there is a decline in the level of nitrogen dioxide in Europe and US, said Andreas Richter, senior scientist, University of Bremen, Germany./He was speaking at the Indo-German workshop on 'challenges and opportunities in air pollution and climate change' organised by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune on Monday./Richter said that there is concern regarding the rise. ""The increase in nitrogen dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas, is related to economic activities. The sources of nitrogen dioxide include emission from vehicles, power plants, forest fire and lightning, among others. In the case of India, the rise in nitrogen dioxide is mainly due to emission from vehicles,'' he said./He stressed that satellite remote sensing observations are valuable tools for observation of trophospheric pollution like nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulphur dioxide, among others./Raghu Murtugudde, professor at University of Maryland, USA, who was speaking on 'climate change, water quality and human health' said that climate change will bring in regional weather changes like heat waves, extreme weather, temperature, humidity, precipitation and vegetation changes./On health effects due to climate change, he said that it will lead to heat-cold related to morbidity and mortality, extreme weather-related morbidity, airborne allergens and pathogens, water and food-borne diseases, zoonotic and vector-borne diseases, food and water shortage effects, infectious and other health effects./Around 50 students from various fields participated in the workshop. There will be an informal discussion between senior scientists and young Indian researchers on research and career opportunities in Germany and India on January 17. Around five students will be selected for specific PhD and postdoctoral research programmes./There will be a public lecture on 'Does the atmosphere help us to get rid of air pollution? The self-cleaning capacity in global change' by Andreas Wahner, an eminent atmospheric scientist and director of the Institute of Energy and Climate Research - Troposphere, Julich, Germany, at 5.30 pm at the NCL auditorium, Pashan Road.

Silent killers,"AHMEDABAD: This might be the best city to live in India but there are a few black spots that need to be dealt with. One contentious issue is pollution./Contrary to popular belief, vehicular pollution on city roads and industries emitting black smoke from chimneys are not the only pollutants. According to researchers, there are many more 'culprits' that pollute the air we breathe. Even a brick kiln located outside Bopal or a power plant in Gandhinagar will be capable of polluting the city's ambient air quality./These are silent pollutants which emit particulate matter of less than 10 micrometers in size (PM10). Power plants, dusty roads and brick kilns are some of the other pollutants./These factors were highlighted by a study named 'Urban air pollution and co-benefits analysis in India' published recently for six Indian cities, including Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot, Pune, Indore and Chennai./The study was conducted by New Delhi-based research group UrbanEmissions.Info to understand the sources of air pollution in these cities and also projected pollution rate in 2020. As per the study, all six cities exceed the annual ambient standard of 60 ug/ m3 (micrograms per cubic meter) of PM10./In 2003, the city was branded as the most polluted in the country. Since then many changes have been made like introduction of CNG autorickshaws and BRTS. But, the PM10 threat is yet to be addressed effectively. The researchers say that BRTS and its cycle track could hold the key to resolving this issue in future./Sarath Guttikunda, founder of UrbanEmissions.Info who also developed statistical tools for the project told TOI, ""Ahmedabad has a high level of PM10. Here, pollution comes from a variety of sources - power plants and brick kilns surrounding the district. We often believe that vehicles moving in immediate surroundings contribute to the pollution in cities. However, a plant or a kiln away from the city can also affect Ahmedabad considering the wind direction.""/Guttikunda added, ""While Chennai has almost the same size and more industries, sea breeze blows PM10 away from the city, reducing the suspended particulates in the air. Going by the PM10 levels in Ahmedabad, the estimated premature deaths due to pollution is likely to be 4,950 as compared to 3,950 in Chennai.""/The Pollutants/The five main pollutants responsible for majority of the health hazards in Indian cities are particulates (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3). According to the study, consequences of exposure to these pollutants range from premature mortality to aggravated morbidity effects such as respiratory problems, asthma, chronic bronchitis and oxygen deficiency in blood./The Solution/As per the study, the need of the hour is an air quality management plan which looks at a mix of policies to promote public transport, walking and cycling, improve efficiencies of industries, power plants, and brick kilns, and controls dust on the roads, for better air quality in the cities./The study also highlighted the fact that a better transport system such as BRTS and less dependency on open burning for cooking or waste disposal is expected to reduce pollutants in air. While Ahmedabad emitted 35,100 tons of PM10, it is expected to decrease a bit in a decade and reach to 31,800 in 2020, says the study/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air pollution, harsh climate also take toll","Independent, smart, tech-savvy and ready to take on the world. Meet the new-age Delhi kids. Groomed in the best schools and brought up with access to state-of-the-art health facilities and information, they sure are a confident lot. However, there’s a flipside to being born in Delhi, they feel./Piya Gill, 16, who lives in Patparganj in east Delhi, says, “The extreme weather conditions and exposure to excessive noise and air pollution makes life difficult in the city. If I was born in a smaller town, I am sure I would have been healthier. The pollution levels would be lower and I wouldn’t be so dependent on junk food,” says Gill./Experts echo Gill’s views. Dr Anupam Sibal, paediatrician and medical director, Apollo Hospital, says Delhi’s peculiar weather makes children more vulnerable to certain ailments. “Gastrointestinal diseases are common among children in the summer months, when temperatures go up to 45 degrees Celsius. The bitter cold is no better. Low temperature and smog aggravate asthma and bronchitis and limit outdoor activities,” he said. Lack of outdoor activities and exposure to the sun put children at a risk for Vitamin D deficiency./A study has revealed 11.9% of Delhi’s schoolchildren in the age group of 5–16 years suffer from bronchial asthma. Significant risk factors for its development are male sex, a family history of atopic disorders and the presence of smokers in the family./Wheezing, another respiratory disorder, was found to be common among schoolchildren. In a study published in medical journal Indian Paediatrics, over 30% school going children were found to be affected by wheezing. “Exposure to environmental pollutants, compromised immunity and overcrowding makes children more vulnerable,” says Dr Sanjeev Bagai, senior pediatric consultant, Nephron Clinic./Delhi Government’s statistical handbook released last year showed that 7,525 persons died of complications from respiratory diseases in 2010 — a 41% increase from 2009. Pollution is a contributing factor to these deaths, say experts./“We are losing out on the benefits of introducing CNG buses to thousands of cars that are being added to city’s roads every day. Pollution levels are up, with levels of airborne particles smaller than 10 micrometers, called PM10s, often touching 300 per cubic metre, thrice more than the city’s permissible limit of 100 per cubic metre and well above the World Health Organization’s recommended limit of 20 per cubic metre,” said a senior government official./“Today, children step out of AC homes, travel in AC cars and study in AC classrooms with hardly any exposure to sunlight. They grow up in cramped spaces with little clean air to breathe and no room for recreation,” said an expert./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Pune has highest RSPM, Nox concentration in state","PUNE: A statistical analysis of air pollution in the state carried out by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) shows that the average values of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) and Nitrogen oxide (Nox) concentrations, calculated during last year, were highest in Pune region./The status of air pollution estimated from April 2010 till March 2011 also said that So2 concentrations seemed to be highest in Pimpri Chinchwad and lowest in Solapur while Karve Road in Pune recorded the maximum RSPM on an average last year. The average ambient air quality in Pune showed an exceedence factor of 1.5, which brings this region under the 'high pollution' category according to notified standards by the National Air Monitoring Programme (NAMP)./Chest physician Parag Khatavkar said, ""Breathing the air that contains particulate matter such as RSPM, SO2, Carbon monoxide and Nox can result in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in which the inside of the patient's airways get swollen and thickened. COPD also leads to narrowing of the airway caliber while gradually scar tissue gets deposited in the airways."" He added that breathing air containing such pollutants may aggravate symptoms in asthma patients./The NAMP identifies four air pollutants viz., Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Oxides of Nitrogen as NO2, Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM/PM10). On an annual basis, the permissible limit of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM/PM10) is 60 ug/m3 as per the national ambient air quality monitoring standards. Similarly, the permissible limit for NO2 and SO2 is 40 ug/m3 an d 50 ug/m3 respectively./The places that were monitored for their ambient air quality were Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation building; Nal Stop; Swargate; Bhosari, Karve Road in Pune; Satara; Voronoko School, Solapur; and WIT campus, Solapur. The annual average concentrations for SO2 near Voronoko School, Solapur was found to be 16.7 ug/m3, while near Pimpri Chinchwad civic body building it was 26 ug/m3, well within the prescribed standards. Bhosari, Swargate, Nal Stop and Karve Road showed concentrations for SO2 within the standards of 50 ug/m3, as their annual average concentration of the pollutant was 31 ug/m3, 22 ug/m3, 21 ug/m3 and 11 ug/m3 respectively./The annual average concentrations for NO2 exceeded the prescribed limit of 40 ug/m3 in three locations in Pune; with the Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation building area recording an annual average concentration of the pollutant as 49 ug/m3, Swargate as 54 ug/m3, and Nal Stop as 43 ug/m3. However, the annual average concentrations for RSPM exceeded the prescribed standard of 60 ug/m3 in all locations in the region. Area near Voronoko School, Solapur showed an annual average RSPM concentration of 70.6 ug/m3, WIT campus, Solapur, showed 73.2 ug/m3, PCMC building showed 87 ug/m3, Bhosari 91 ug/m3, Swargate 86 ug/m3, Nal Stop 89 ug/m3 and Karve Road showed 129 ug/m3, which was highest among all the other locations monitored./P K Mirashe, western region officer, MPCB, said, ""The statistical analysis of the data over the entire Pune region however showed that the annual average concentrations for SO2 is found to be 21.2 ug/m3, which is within the prescribed standards. Nox has been found out to be 43.6 ug/m3, marginally above the stipulated standards and RSPM concentrations are found to be 94.4 ug/m3, which again, is above the prescribed standards.""/He further said that the differences in data for individual sub-regions shows that monthly RSPM concentrations vary from 12 ug/m3 to 386 ug/m3, whereas that for SO2 and Nox ranges from 5 ug/m3 to 95 ug/m3 and 9 ug/m3 to 149 ug/m3. ""The stark variation in these values comes about due to change from one season to another. Winters witness high concentration of pollutants due to frequent temperature in-versions and calm winds. During summers, the strong winds wipe away these pollutants from the air; something that does not happen in winters,"" he said./Mirashe added that the average ambient air quality in Pune showed an Exceedence Factor of 1.5, which from the National Ambient Air Quality Standards' (NAAQS) point of view is 30 percent higher when compared to the 24-hour prescribed standards. ""RSPM and Nox concentrations are highest in Pune and lowest in Solapur probably due to the highest number of two-wheelers in Pune and higher re-suspension of dust caused by adverse road conditions and rapid rate of construction. On the other hand, SO2 concentrations seem to be higher in PCMC and lowest in Solapur, perhaps because the monitoring station is located in an industrial area in PCMC,' he said./________________________________________________________/Neha Madaan/Pune: A similar analysis of the river water quality over the same period (April 2010 till March 2011) in the Pune region by MPCB showed that its surface water quality exceeded the prescribed standards by 5-10 %, making most water bodies intolerable for diverse aquatic life./P K Mirashe, western region officer of MPCB, said, ""After comparing the trend of indicators during the last year, it was seen that most components of water quality do not comply with the prescribed standards. The Pune region had an average pH level of 7.9 during the year analyzed, which was within the prescribed standard. Surface water quality in Pune I and II exceeded the standards by 5 to 10%, where as sub-region Pune I showed an average (Biological Oxygen Demand) BOD level at a maximum point of 24 mg/l, which is several times higher than the prescribed limit in the water quality standards.""/Maximum average chemical oxygen demand (COD - 30.4mg/l) was recorded in Pimpri Chinchwad while the highest and lowest individual levels of COD recorded were 42mg/l and 4.35 mg/l in Pavana river at Sangvi and in Nira river (flowing through Pune and Solapur) at Aklai Devi Mandir respectively. ""This shows the impact on surface water bodies due to discharge of treated/untreated sewage directly into the river,"" he said./""It was observed that the discharge of domestic untreated sewage from the Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits is the main sources of water pollution here,"" he said, adding that treated effluent from the industries is being used for gardening purposes in most of the cases and very few industries are discharging their effluent into the rivers./He added that the pH here, which should have been in the range of 5.5 to 9.0, showed an average of 7.51. BOD and COD, which should have limits of 30 mg/l and 250 mg/l respectively, have shown excess values in some stations located in Pimpri Chinchwad municipal area, except Ravet weir. ""This highlights the fact that water entering the area is potable but it gets polluted while exiting,"" he added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Suspended particles in air aggravate lung diseases',"VARANASI: Is the variability in aerosol distribution over Varanasi threatening health risk, especially respiratory diseases? If experts are to be believed, the distribution of atmospheric aerosol not only plays an important role in the study of Earth's radiation but also keeps a close tab on air quality, environment and human health, especially respiratory diseases./""Atmospheric aerosol particles are very tiny liquid or solid particles that are suspended in the air. Their variation in the distribution causes accumulation of particulate matter of lower size (between two to five microns), also known as respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), and they threaten to directly enter the lungs and aggravate lung diseases,"" said AK Singh of Atmospheric Research Laboratory, Department of Physics, Banaras Hindu University on the concluding day of four-day-long second international workshop on 'spectroscopic signatures of molecular complexes /ions in our atmosphere and beyond', jointly organised by the UP Autonomous College and Department of Applied Physics, IT-BHU on Friday./It may be mentioned here that AK Singh has studied the characteristics of atmospheric aerosol and its composition, temporal as well as spatial distribution over Varanasi, which is located in the heart of Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB). We studied the aerosol optical length (AOD) and metrological parameters like temperature, pressure and water vapour. Variability in aerosol distribution including AOD was noted and water vapour showed good correlation with enhancement of AOD. ""However, it was found that anomalous enhancement of AOD during dust storms are harful and aggravate the risk of respiratory diseases in the region,"" he added. Similarly, saying that dust storms are normally occurring event that take place in arid and semi-arid regions, he also emphasised that the frequently occurring dust storms carrying local aerosol particles are a threat for human health especially aggravating respiratory problems./The air pollution tend to increase due to infusion of smoke and dust particles in the atmosphere and the most harmful elements in the smoke are the suspended particulate matter of size less than 10 microns. The particles sized between 5-10 microns are usually filtered by our nostrils and the throat, leading to allergy and infection. But, particulate matter of lower size (2-5 microns) also known as RSPM are most harmful as they directly enter the lungs and aggravate lung diseases. On an average, a person inhales and exhales about 15,000-litre of air in a day./Meanwhile, the four-day-long international workshop came to an end with varied discussions on molecular complexes and ions in the atmosphere that affect global climate. The focus of discussions revolved around climate change and global warming with recent advancements in the field./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Space fuel for urban shuttles,"It's the main fuel of NASA's space shuttle launchers and will now power a test fleet of autos in the city. Hydrogen, so far used terrestrially in some avantgarde customized cars and experimental bus fleets, will run 15 autorickshaws developed as part of an IIT-Delhi project. But unlike London's hydrogen buses and California's Hydrogen Highway project that use complicated fuel-cell technology, the Delhi autos will be built around cheaper internal combustion engines./Professor LM Das of IIT-D , who has perfected the technology, explains the rationale for hydrogen power: “Hydrogen is like a slightly temperamental child. You need to tame it. Once controlled, it can be much more efficient than even compressed natural gas (CNG)”./Das says he conceived the idea of using compressed hydrogen as an automotive fuel with Delhi's air pollution in mind. In the early '80s, it was a bold initiative - an idea ahead of its time. Lay acquaintances thought he was talking about making a hydrogen bomb. Detractors in the scientific community dismissed his research as a freak project./But Das soldiered on alone over the next three decades as associates came and went. “No one can turn a blind eye to the environmental degradation caused by vehicles. In fact, before CNG came, Delhi had become unlivable . So, despite all the criticism that my research was too futuristic , I pursued it. Now the world knows that aggressive steps are required to mitigate the environmental damage that has been done,” he says./Unlike petroleum-derived hydrocarbon fuels, pure hydrogen does not produce toxic carbon monoxide or the heat-trapping carbon dioxide on combustion. There are no oxides of sulphur, nor any particulates. Water vapour and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are the only byproducts. Although NOx is a pollutant, Das claims their engine has been optimized to reduce its emission greatly. “We got the best efficiency and very low emissions,” he says./As a member of the government-appointed core group on automotive research, Das had worked on a hydrogen fuel assignment from United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the International Centre for Hydrogen Energy Technologies (UNIDO-ICHET ) based in Istanbul, in 2006. Over the next three years, the engines were developed at IIT. A conventional CNG engine was used with modifications for compressed hydrogen gas./While the project at IIT-D's Department of Energy Studies resembled a turnstile, one man alone stayed on with Das - lab technician GP Singh. The 14-member team stabilized after the project was officially taken over by automobile firm Mahindra that has built up a strong presence in alternative energy with hybrid and electric vehicles. The new system was implemented on autos provided by the company and trials were done inside the IIT campus./Apart from developing the autos - branded Mahindra HyAlfa and shown to the public at last month's Auto Expo - Das' team is also working on two hydrogen-fuelled minibuses with a 2014 deadline. Senior project scientist , GP Subhash, who quit his job at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies to join Das, says the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is keen on developing a hydrogen-run minibus. “The Rs 15-crore project aims to develop two mini buses by 2014. The idea will take some time to be part of our daily lives. But we are at it to prove the efficiency of hydrogen fuel,” he says./Meanwhile, the HyAlfa, which resembles Mahindra's Alfa autos commonly seen in NCR towns, awaits its commercial launch and will be the first mass-produced hydrogen-run internal combustion engine vehicle in the world. The higher price of the modified engine and fuel system is a challenge, though, for its target market. The economics of running these autos in Delhi is yet to be worked out. But Das, Subhash and their team are looking forward to the day when the technology will become an example for the world and give Delhiites a chance to have a smooth ride with less noise and smoke./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pollution in Sonbhadra not on political radar,"SONBHADRA: Sonbhadra has no dearth of ironies. It is one of the richest districts in the state in terms of natural resources but its people are among the poorest. More than half of power generation in UP takes place here but it gets power supply for less than 10 hours a day./The finest quality of cement and concrete is produced in Sonbhadra but the roads are pathetic and only 13.2% people have pucca houses. It is a major revenue earner for the state but in return people here have got death and destruction because of high pollution level due to illegal mining and quarrying. The worst part is that these factors do not figure as main issues in the election ./Sonbhadra is situated in one of the oldest hill ranges of UP --Kaimoor . More that 57% of the land is forest. Coal, aluminium, limestone, sandstone, riverside sand and many other natural and mineral resources are found in abundance. Cement factories and crushers producing concrete is one of the main industries here. However, there is no regulation. Only 15 crushers have been sanctioned but locals say over 250 are operating ; most of them illegal and violating the norms laid down by the Supreme Court./Ideally, every crusher unit should have water sprinkler to prevent silica dust from polluting the air. Machines should be used more to avoid human exposure to pollution. Trained blasters should be used to dig out hills to produce cement and concrete. All precautions should be in place to avoid a mishap. But norms are openly flouted. One can find a permanent haze here, which is actually a heavy concentration of dust particles suspended in the air./“Pollution has not become a main issue in election because most contestants get donations from owners of crushing units,” said Vijay, a local activist. Government doctors said on an average they receive 100 patients of tuberculosis and silicosis per month. Silicosis is an occupational lung disease that develops over time when dust that contains silica is inhaled into the lungs. There's no cure for silicosis. An affected person should not be exposed to pollution./Government has set up units for the two diseases but doctors say they cannot do anything substantial till the source of pollution is not removed. The chemicals released in the Son river by the metal industries is also causing water pollution which is hazardous for the people. The fly ash from the thermal power plants and cement factories is also a major source of air pollution here. Six units of Anpara and Obra thermal power plants generate 2800 MW but only 717 out of 1426 villages are electrified ./Dinkar Kapur, a candidate of Jan Sangharsh Morcha, who raised the issue of pollution , said illegal mining is underway in connivance with the government officials and minister./Fast facts/Wildlife/Tribal culture.

Rising pollution takes a toll on kids’ health,"JAIPUR: Being born in a big city is always considered a privilege given the access to good schooling, exposure to high standards of living, all of which go into making children confident and ready to take on the world./However, there's a flip side to it as well. High levels of pollution, increasing peer pressure and binging on fast food are some of the few unpleasant factors associated with a city life./Fourteen-year-old Mukesh Sharma of Shyam Nagar says a city like Jaipur, that has got several good schools, provides him a chance to aspire for ambitious career goals. “But, the pollution level is high in the city. Noise and air pollution are taking a toll on my health. I often have an upset stomach due to eating junk food.”/Experts too feel that living conditions, as far as health is concerned, in rural areas are definitely better than in cities./J K Lon Hospital (a childcare specialty centre) superintendent Dr SD Sharma said, “The suicidal tendencies are higher among urban students as they live under constant stress due to studies and peer pressure. They eat junk food, don't do any physical work or exercises, which make them prone to various kinds of illness.”/A recent state survey ‘International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Childhood’ revealed that the children in the state are vulnerable to asthma and nose and eye allergies./Head of division of allergy & pulmonary medicine at SMS Medical College, Dr Virendra Singh, says, “During the survey in Jaipur, we found that 8% of the children are suffering from asthma. Incidences of eye and nose allergies are found to be the highest among children in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Bikaner.”/Singh, who was the survey’s national coordinator, says such problems arise because of presence of pollutants in the air, mainly harmful gases emitted by vehicles./Not indulging in any kind of physical activity also makes urban kids more vulnerable to respiratory diseases. Add to that, high intake of junk food instead of following a nutrient-rich diet, is another reason for low immunity among these children. Sources said respirable particulate matter (RSPM) is above the normal level in various parts of the city, which may cause respiratory diseases./For instance, RSPM level in Chandpole (one of the most polluted areas in the city) was measured at 206 mcg (micrograms) last year, twice the national standard level of 100 mcg./Dr Sharad Tikkiwal of Asthma Bhawan, a private hospital in Vidyadhar Nagar that exclusively treats asthma patients, presses the alarm for city kids. “The number of asthma cases among children is increasing because of rising levels of pollution and change in the lifestyle pattern.”/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

We can take up a lot of activities connected to water, land use, air pollution, among others, to make Pune sustainable,’’ Bharucha added./The other panelists discussed the five elements — earth, air, water, energy and space — on similar lines, besides speaking about the salient features of Pune’s environment and how one can contribute towards a sustainable lifestyle./Noted ecologist Madhav Gadgil said that the natural resources were being misutilized. “This is not a new trend, it was there earlier also. People are spending much more and we do not know where this is going to lead,’’ he said./Town planner Aneeta Benninger said: “ ‘How can I consume more’ is the goal today. Development is directly related to consumption. How much land a man needs is the question.’’/Speaking on ‘water’, Vijay Paranjpye, environment expert and president of NGO Gomukh, pointed out that at present beautification of river or navigation was not needed. “If the river is highly polluted it has to go to hospital (restoration) and not to a beauty parlour (beautification). Rather we have to see that by 2025, the release of sewage and industrial effluents into rivers be stopped. Thus, the most important factor is restoration of the rivers,’’ he said./Conservation architect Chetan Sahasrabudhe said that earlier ‘place making’ was rich and thought provoking. But now it is dry and sterile and degraded urban environment. “Earlier, importance was given to open spaces and there used to be courtyards.

Pneumonia can be prevented in children,"Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs. The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes./When there is an infection in the lungs, these alveoli fill with pus and fluid, which is the body’s natural response to fighting infection. This infection in the lungs makes breathing difficult and limits oxygen intake. Pneumonia is a serious life-threatening illness in children. According to UNICEF, there are approximately 155 million cases of childhood Pneumonia every year in the world. In India, 3, 50,000 children were reported to have died of pneumonia in 2008./Pneumonia in children can be caused by viruses and bacteria . There are two bacteria that are responsible for most pneumonia related deaths: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Both these bacteria can also cause acute meningitis (infection of the membranes covering the brain) in young children. In newborn babies pneumonia may spread through the blood, especially during and shortly after birth./Cough is a common symptom of respiratory infections including pneumonia . Most children with cough and cold /fever have upper respiratory tract infections due to viral infection (not Pneumonia). Whereas children with pneumonia should be treated with appropriate antibiotics, those with viral respiratory tract infections do not require antibiotics. Children with pneumonia have fast breathing along with cough. In severe cases the child may have indrawing of lower chest wall when he/she breathes in, grunting and difficulty in breathing. If your child exhibits cough with fast breathing with or without other symptoms , an immediate check up is recommended, as it could be a case of pneumonia. Pneumonia can be effectively treated with antibiotics . Severe cases require hospitalization as the child may need oxygen. Besides an X-ray is normally done in such a case to check for any complications./Although we have effective treatment for pneumonia; taking precautions and preventive measures such as, frequent washing of hands and general cleanliness reduce the transmission of microorganisms and are effective measures to prevent pneumonia . Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months is vital to ensure the child gets adequate nutrition and builds natural immunity against infection. Keeping your child in a safe and healthy environment is of utmost importance in ensuring the wellness of your child./As with most diseases, prevention is always better than treatment. Vaccines are an effective way to safeguard your child against pneumonia. DPT, a vaccine against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus and measles vaccine are effective in preventing pneumonia caused by whooping cough and measles. A new vaccine that protects children against Hib as well as diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and hepatitis B, is now available. Vaccines that prevent against Streptococcus pneumoniae are also available in India./In order to save children from pneumonia and its complications protect (breastfeeding, handwashing, avoid indoor air pollution), prevent (vaccination) and appropriately treat (antibiotics for pneumonia) them./- Dr Satinder Aneja, Director-Professor, Department of Pediatrics, Lady Hardinge Medical College/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"P3 Smoking kills, but PMC makes a killing","PUNE: More the people smoke the more our civic body earns. At least this is what the statistics of the Pune Municipal Corporation's octroi collections indicate./The PMC earned a whopping Rs 19.52 crore in octroi from sale of cigarettes this year as compared to Rs 17.84 crore it earned last year. This when city-based Chest Research Foundation fears that rising pollution levels are putting smokers at the risk of succumbing to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)./Smoking is a major environmental risk factor for the development of COPD. Other factors like occupational exposures, ambient air pollution, and exposure to second-hand smoke contribute to the condition./""The PMC imposes 8% octroi on cigarettes. A few years back, it was 7%. There is a strong demand to increase the rate further as it would result in increase in prices of tobacco products and prove a deterrent to smokers. Till recently, the PMC earned anything in between Rs 5 crore and Rs 10 crore. In the last three-four years, the collection has gone up sharply. By the end of February this year, we had earned Rs 19.52 crore. The figure will definitely go up by the end of this financial year,"" said PMC octroi chief Hemant Nikam./'Smoking main cause for chronic pulmonary disease'/Doctors are worried about the increasing prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cases in the city./""The rise in sale of cigarettes in Pune is a cause for concern, especially when air pollution has increased significantly. We have observed several cases of chronic obstruction of the flow of air through the airways and out of the lungs. The obstruction is usually permanent and progressive as the disease gets worse with time,"" says Sandeep Salvi, director of city-based Chest Research Foundation./Smokers are not only damaging their lungs, but also their knees and hearts. Doctors have found that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease makes people prone to osteoporosis and other medical conditions./Air pollution, both indoor and outdoor, has been recognized over the past several decades as an important threat to pulmonary health and a significant contributor to COPD. Various surveys in the last few years have put Pune in the list of most-polluted cities in the country, but the PMC and its elected members have failed to draft a comprehensive policy to assess pollution and its impact on citizens./""We are conducting a targeted COPD population study in Pune, focusing on IT professionals. This disease is going to be a major challenge to the city's health as the overall trend is serious and there is no system in place to check the ever-growing number of smokers,"" said Salvi./Worldwide, one in 10 adults over the age of 40, may have COPD. In India, nearly 3 million people die of it every year. According to the World Health Organization, COPD is the fourth leading cause of deaths worldwide, surpassed only by heart attack, stroke, and acute lung infections. It kills more people than cancer, and as many people as AIDS. Researchers at the Indian Institute of Environmental Medicine (IIEM) put the urban and rural prevalence of COPD at 7-8 %./""It is time for the PMC and NGOs to come together and check the rising trend of smoking. We would raise the issue in the general body (GB) meeting. The civic body, in turn, should plan a comprehensive policy to curb smoking habit, especially among youths,"" said corporator and Congress leader in PMC, Aba Bagul./Says Salvi, ""Another trend is the steady rise in number of women smokers, who consider it more as a fashion statement. Besides, growing number of hookah parlours are worsening the COPD scenario.""/S K Jindal, a medical professional with the Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh, said that COPD was so far under-diagnosed in India. In his study, 'Emergence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as an epidemic in India', Jindal says, ""COPD is now recognised in 4-10% of the adult male population. In non-smokers, especially women, an exposure to indoor air pollution from domestic combustion of solid fuels is an important factor. More significantly, the exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is an established cause for COPD. On an average, an Indian COPD patient spent about 15% of his income on smoking products and up to 30% on disease management.""/Exposure to domestic combustion, especially solid (or biomass) fuels such as dried dung, wood and crop residue, is an important cause of chronic bronchitis and COPD among women. Respiratory difficulties were found among 13% of the 3,608 non-smoking women who cooked regularly, especially in poorly ventilated houses./WHAT IS COPD?/Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD is caused due to persistent obstruction of the flow of air through the airways and out of the lungs. The obstruction is usually permanent and progressive as the disease gets worse over the time./CAUSES/Smoking is responsible for 90% cases. Air pollution (indoor and outdoor) can cause problems for people with lung diseases./SYMPTOMS/Breathlessness, abnormal sputum and chronic cough. Daily activities, such as walking up a short flight of stairs or carrying a suitcase, can become very difficult as the condition progresses./TREATMENT/It is is not curable. Treatment can help control its symptoms and improve the quality of life for people with the illness./PREVALENCE/Earlier, it was more common among men, but because of increased tobacco consumption among women in high-income countries and exposure to indoor air pollution in low-income countries like India, the disease now affects men and women almost equally. COPD develops slowly and is, therefore, usually diagnosed in people aged 40 or above./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Tobacco products set to get costlier,"PUNE: Cigarette, cigar and pipe tobacco could be costlier in the city with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) initiating steps to hike octroi charges on these products to 15% from the existing 8%./“The PMC can charge more octroi on cigarette, but has to seek state permission for the same. In Maharashtra, Nagpur civic body charges 15% octroi on tobacco-related products and the state government has given them special permission. If the PMC wants to increase the octroi, we have to follow the same procedure and seek special permission from the state. The demand by corporators to hike octroi is workable,” said octroi department chief Hemant Nikam, replying the debate on tax structure at the General Body meeting on Wednesday./The PMC earned a whopping Rs 19.52 crore in octroi from sale of cigarettes this year as compared to Rs 17.84 crore the year before. This when city-based Chest Research Foundation fears that rising pollution levels are putting smokers at the risk of succumbing to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). If the PMC imposes 15% octroi on cigarette, cigar and pipe tobacco, the octroi revenue will go up by around over Rs 15 crore per year./At the GB meeting, all party corporators demanded that the civic administration should increase octroi on the cigarette, cigar and pipe tobacco considering the rising number of smokers in the city./MNS corporator Rajendra alias Babu Wagaskar said that the PMC should seek the information from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation on how to levy heavy octroi charges on tobacco products and forward a similar proposal to the state government. “This will help curb the rising number of smokers and also help civic body to earn more income. Instead of increasing octroi on essential goods like foodgrains, the PMC should hike octroi on tobacco products,” said Wagaskar. Newly-elected women representatives supported Wagaskar and said the civic administration should immediately hike the octroi./Leader of the house and NCP corporator Subhash Jagtap supported the demand and said, “We will unanimously approve the hike. But, we will have to follow the procedure and seek the state nod. We will also increase octroi on liquor imported in the city.”/Sandeep Salvi, director of city-based Chest Research Foundation, speaking to TOI, said the rising sale of cigarettes in city is a cause for concern and all possible steps should be taken by the government and the local governing body to curb smoking.

The few existing stations are in the wrong places and do not provide an accurate picture of the rising pollution levels. There are no monitors, for example, near the city’s highly polluted dumping yards at Kodungaiyur and Perungudi./At a workshop to analyze urban air quality of Chennai organized by the Institute of Financial Management and Research (IFMR) and Urban Emissions.Info, experts pointed out that Chennai’s air pollution levels were among the worst in the country but the city lacked a proper system to monitor the problem./Rajesh Rangarajan, project lead of IFMR’s India Pollution Map, said monitoring by the pollution control board should be extended to the suburban areas. “Emission sources like dumpsites also need to be monitored for a better understanding of pollution in the city,” Rangarajan said./He said the board had not installed pollution recording meters in Perungudi and Kodungaiyur despite complaints by the thousands of families living in these areas over air being filled with smoke from burning garbage./Chennai has five ambient air quality monitoring stations run by the TNPCB. Experts say these stations do not record figures that properly reflect even air pollution levels of the neighbourhoods in which they are located because they have been set up on streets with low traffic density./Chitra Grace, a senior epidemiologist with the Indian Council of Medical Research, said pollution monitoring standards should be revised regularly because new pollutants can enter urban environments./“The current PM10 (particulate pollution) standard has to be revised.

25% Bangalore children have asthma,"BANGALORE: Changing demographics, ever-increasing air pollution, air-conditioned houses and offices and different dietary habits have increased the prevalence of asthma — one of the most dangerous respiratory disorders — in Bangalore. A study by the Institute of Medical Education and Research across four Indian cities —Delhi , Chandigarh, Kanpur and Bangalore— reported asthma prevalence in adults at 3.47% in 2011. About 10% adults in Bangalore are said to be suffering from asthma, according to pulmonologists./A study conducted by Lakeside Medical Center and Hospital and its team of pulmonologists between 1979 and 2009 concluded there is a three-fold rise in asthma cases among children. Said Dr H Paramesh, director, Lakeside Medical Center and a paediatric pulmonologist: “About 9% children were found to be suffering from asthma in 1979. In 2009, we found 25.5% children suffering from it.” In adults, the present prevalence is about 10%, he added./What’s more worrying, added Paramesh, is the prevalence of persistent asthma (which needs medication ) among children has gone up to 72.5%. “We must blame the changed weather conditions, increased air pollution level and eating habits for it. Also, houses , offices and schools nowadays lack ventilation. People, especially children, prefer junk food over freshly cooked home food. All these have contributed to the rise in number of cases,” he said./Said Dr Vishwanth Bellad, consultant, pulmonologist, BGS Global Hospitals : “Asthma is commonly seen in younger people, the majority in the age group of less than 20 years. The symptoms are more visible during childhood, but no age is immune to asthma./Bangalore is more vulnerable to this disease because of the climatic conditions as it rains almost through the year and the air density is low.”/“Asthma is constantly on the rise in Bangalore. We can blame it on more greenery, which generates pollens, the main source of allergy. Also, people are more exposed to environmental pollution which increases respiratory disorders,” said Dr Sumant Mantri, consultant, pulmonologist , Apollo Hospital./What can lead to it/“Genetic and environment factors can trigger asthma in children. The gene Adam 33 is said to be responsible for someone contracting asthma . If a child, who has an aggressive Adam 33 gene is exposed to unhygienic conditions, pollution , etc. then the chances of her contracting asthma increases.

Less resistance in body triggers asthma: Experts,"KANPUR: The rising cases of Asthma is not a new thing for the city, which is among the most polluted cities in the country. But if the health experts are to be believed, asthma has nothing to do with the rise in pollution. However, unbalanced lifestyle and less resistance in the human body are the major causes asthma./Dr SK Katiyar, chest specialist and former principal of Ganesh Shanker Vidyarthi Memorial Medical College, said that asthma is an allergic disease which has nothing to do with the rising pollution. However, allergy from dust consists a large number of asthma patients but diet and lifestyle is a bigger reason which is ruining the lungs of the people./“Processed, adulterated and junk food which contain a lot of chemicals are a greater source of allergens which cause asthma. Also, the fertilizers used in cropping and agricultural process and toxic injections used in artificial ripening of vegetable and fruits is a major source of asthmatic allergies,” Dr Katiyar added./Most of the asthmatic allergies are caused due to pollen emitted from plants. Each patient is allergic to different kind of pollens which gave him/her asthmatic attacks. As pollen is emitted at the time of year when seasonal changes take place, this why the chances of asthma attacks increased with the change in season./“Dust is also a big reason for asthma as wind carries maximum pollens in it. Apart from dust, people also get respiratory ailments due to vehicular pollution which is on rise in the city,” Dr Katiyar said./Aping of the western lifestyle by the youngsters is taking them away from healthy lifestyle. Natural and healthy foods like milk, curd, ghee, fruits and vegetables are totally out of menu. Children are addicted to play computer games and chat on Internet, rather than go out for physical activities./Child specialist Dr S Tripathi pointed out that just few years ago, the children were found playing in the parks, while these spots are now remain for morning walkers only. Also, the physical training classes in the schools has now been replaced by computer or other activities. This has lowered the resistance in the body and the children are getting prone to allergic infections./Urging for awareness among people which can reduce asthma, Dr Anil Nigam, chest specialist at Ursula Horsman Hospital said that nearly 80 patients visit the OPD of UHM with chest blockage and 30% of them suffer from asthma./The air pollution not only refers to the dust level in the city but even vehicular and industrial pollution./Even ultraviolet rays from ozone which contains chlorofluorocarbons is a major cause of producing allergens in air.

Increasing vehicles amplify pollution levels,"LUCKNOW: The 8.68% rise in the number of vehicles during 2011-12 has taken its toll on city's ambient air quality. As a result, there is no let-up either in the air pollution or the noise pollution levels. The increase in the number of vehicles has also led to a rise in the concentration of fine particulate matter in the air./The ambient air quality assessment report released by the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research on Tuesday, shows rise in pollution levels for residential, commercial and industrial areas of the city. The Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) level at nine monitoring locations was found to be higher than the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)/When the data for this year was compared with the previous years, it showed an increasing trend of air pollution, except Indiranagar and Alambagh. The concentration of gaseous pollutants has also increased, as compared to last year. The only respite is that the levels recorded are within the prescribed national standards./The rising level of air pollution indicates that state agencies have failed to fulfil their role. The Comptroller and Auditor General in its report on May 30, had pulled up the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) for not performing its role effectively. The report said that the board has failed to plan a comprehensive programme for prevention and control of air pollution in Lucknow since its inception in 1975. Low priority was accorded to environmental issues by the state government, as expenditure on it was reduced from Rs 14.08 crore (0.025%) to Rs 3.11 crore (0.002%) of total expenditure of the state during 2005-11./The CAG report further observed that 23 out of 82 recognised private centres meant for checking the level of vehicular emission have not upgraded their software, but have still issued Pollution Under Control certificate./The IITR report, on the other hand, mentions that all pollutants, including metals, have adverse effects on human health. The finer particles (RSPM and PM), which are inhaled, are responsible for several cardiovascular and respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, reproductive development, increased risk of pre-term birth and even mortality. The respirable particles can penetrate deep into the respiratory system. A particulate matter is a complex mixture of chemical agents of different shapes and sizes./The tail pipe emission from vehicle is another important source of air pollutants like RSPM, heavy metals and gases./The report also stated that traffic noise has become a major environmental concern in urban areas with high traffic congestion. Sources of noise in urban areas are primarily vehicular engines, exhaust systems, aerodynamic friction and tyre-pavement interaction. Traffic noise is affected by factors like traffic volume and speed, vehicle mix, pavement type and vehicle conditions./Number of cars has gone up by 10.69% from last year. More than 18,000 cars got registered in 2011-12 in Lucknow/Number of two-wheelers has gone up by 8.43% from last year.

"High court tells corporation, government to identify place to dump garbage","CHENNAI: Continuing its efforts to find a solution to the vexed Pallikaranai dumping yard problem, the Madras high court has asked the Chennai Corporation and the Tamil Nadu government as to whether they had identified any other place for dumping the municipal waste./The first bench comprising Chief Justice M Y Eqbal and Justice T S Sivagnanam, issuing further directions on a public interest writ petition seeking to put out the recent fire at the dump yard and order probe by environment protection agencies, asked the Chennai Corporation to file a detailed affidavit narrating the steps taken for the full compliance of the court’s order delivered in the year 2008./In March 2008, the court had formed an experts committee seeking suggestions on the suitability of the present Pallikaranai site for use as the municipal solid waste yard and measures taken to restore and protect the marshland. It also sought suggestions for remediation of the land, groundwater, flora and fauna at the site./The present round of litigation over the dumping yard commenced after a vast portion of the yard caught fire and thick smoke chocked the vicinity on June 9. The PIL, filed by S Viswanathan, noted that several studies and recommendations by various bodies including the IIT-Madras had not been acted upon, and said that the fire and smoke choked residents living neighbouring the yard and caused poor visibility for motorists./Residents had to remain confined to their houses, even as several fire tenders fought for a couple of days to bring the situation under control./Breathing difficulty, poor visibility and diversion of public transport facilities, in addition to the already existing problems such as groundwater contamination and air pollution, have left the residents distraught, the PIL said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

The Class V student died virtually without treatment despite a state minister's recommendation for government help./Dhannu Saw said doctors in the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences in Ranchi detected the illness of his son Rahul and advised him to take him to Mumbai for treatment. Saw then approached local MLA and minister Chandra Prakash Chaudhary for government help meant for economically backward class to save his son. The minister asked the civil surgeon of Ramgarh for government funds to save the boy. ""However I did not get any kind of government help because my name was not listed on the BPL list.""/The district health department confirmed that the department had received the recommendation letter for government help for Rahul but since the family was not listed in the BPL category, the department was unable to unable to provide government help. There is a provision for government help for cancer or other patients who fall under BPL category and are suffering from deadly diseases./Rahul was not the first who died of cancer in Argada coal belt. Several others suffering from cancer have died since 2003 and approximately 18 people, including women, are battling with the disease./Ramgarh civil surgeon Dr Dilip Kumar Singh admitted that the number of cancer patients in Argada coal belt was on rise. ""The situation is alarming because of industrial pollution in the locality,"" he said adding that industrial pollution was the root cause behind the spread of the disease in the area. Singh said to curb the rising cases of cancer in the industrial area it was necessary to arrange clean water and air pollution./General manager, Argada area of the Central Coalfields Limited A K Jha denied charges made by district health official and said the area was ""one of the cleanest and pollution-free"" belts and it was irrational to say that the rising number of cancer in the locality was because of water and air pollution.

Nagpur experts hail UN's linking of health and environment,"NAGPUR: The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio +20) has recognized an important link between health and development. Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization declared that health is a ""precondition for, an outcome of, and an indicator of sustainable development"". This is also demonstrated by the fact that one of the biggest challenges of this century has been to counter increase in incidence of non-communicable diseases as the world moves towards development./Experts suggest embracing green technologies in terms of transport, housing, energy requirement as a solution towards the creation of societies that are not just economically productive but also healthy. Experts from the city believe that the recognition of the interrelation of health and environment is an important milestone and a step in the right direction. Some, however, expressed concern about the implementation of these ideas./""Doctors have always been promoting better surroundings for better health, so this step by the UN is an appreciable one. The fact that factors like noise, which is responsible for problems ranging from hearing loss to convulsions and even cardiac problems, have also been addressed shows the seriousness of the UN in this regard,"" said Dr Uday Bodhankar, general secretary of the Commonwealth Association for Health and Disability./He also said that faulty habits were responsible for spread of many diseases. ""For example, using a chullah, which is not an environmentally friendly device to cook, is the most common reason for children acquiring pneumonia,"" he explained./It is not just the doctors, other sections of the society also acknowledge the importance of this small step. ""Industrial and vehicular pollution are biggest contributors to air pollution, which leads to various respiratory diseases. So, a mandate towards having green fuels for transport vehicles and improvement in the air and water quality of the countries makes a lot of difference,"" said Prakash Kumbhare, principal scientist and head of the research and development planning division at National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri)./Former president of city branch of Indian Medical Association (IMA) and ENT surgeon Dr Prashant Nikhade believes that health has always remained a neglected area, especially in India. ""We don't realize that a healthy population is essential for a better economic output. The saddest part is we all know the solutions towards the ecological imbalance and its impact on human health, yet we hardly make efforts in the direction of those solutions,"" he said./Environmentalist Kaustav Chatterjee thought it was good that environmental groups have started broadening their horizons, including issues like poverty alleviation and health improvement as pointers towards environmental sustainability. ""After the Kyoto protocol of 2005, most environmental summits have failed to prompt any action. There are several commitments made in all of them but their fulfilment has been a big question mark. There have been several good suggestions in the Rio +20 conference, like considering outlook towards the energy requirements and economic situation of developing countries. It would all make sense only when acted upon,"" he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Indoor pollution equally harmful,"BANGALORE: Talk of pollution and the only thing that comes to mind is outdoor pollution. But indoor pollution caused by use of biomass fuel and passive smoking is equally harmful, if not more. Children under five and homemakers are more vulnerable./In India, where 50% of households still use biomass fuel, children are prone to chronic cough, more risk of lung cancer and worst of all, pneumonia. Apart from malnutrition, pneumonia is the single largest killer of children in the country. In urban areas , except for slums, biomass use is not extensive. And LPG is safe to use,” said SK Chhabra, professor and head of the department, Cardio-respiratory physiology, Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, New Delhi. He was speaking at a one-day workshop organized by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board./The challenge is to shift to the use of alternative fuel sources. Piped natural gas is the best for use, followed by LPG. While piped natural gas is the most expensive option, switching to LPG is the most feasible option. ""Piped natural gas gets burnt out completely to carbon dioxide and water, leaving no residue. LPG on the other hand does not emit harmful gases while biomass is the worst to use with so many gases it releases into the air,"" said Chhabra./“Air pollution (both outdoor and indoor) is one of the serious problems which the urban centres in India, including Bangalore, are faced with. The sources of outside air pollution are many, including domestic fuel burning,” said AS Sadashivaiah, chairman, Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB). The data revealed by KSPCB shows that domestic fuel contributes to 4.6% to outdoor pollution as well./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Jaipur municipal corporation fails in waste management: Report,"JAIPUR: The first spell of monsoon shower brought a huge relief from the blistering summer heat, but along with it came a sordid tale of woes, particularly water-logging and garbage strewn all over./Most places saw water-logging on the roads with garbage meant to be picked up, clogging the drains as the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) disposal system in the city is in a sorry state. Trash thrown outside the bins just got washed away in the streets. It seems 51 health inspectors, 208 jemadars, 6,330 street sweepers and 1,392 temporary sweepers on the rolls of the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) have failed on their job./According to a Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) report, ""Jaipur being an important tourist place, it is very important to maintain cleanliness and hygiene in the city. But the municipal authority has failed to do so; therefore the management of MSW is going through a critical phase.""/During the RSPCB's study, it was found that the JMC has failed to implement MSW management in an effective way and it doesn't seem to have any concrete plan to have a better management in the coming years. It was also found that JMC prioritizes only those areas where the social connectivity is stronger./The board's report also find fault with the JMC's handling of MSW and said the civic body is not following the standard procedure of waste management. ""There should be segregation of MSW at the generation stage itself. Collection efficiency was found to be only around 80% which consequently leads to a huge amount of waste being left out in the city. JMC gives priority to few areas while handling the MSW in comparison to others which further deteriorates the situation of MSW management. Transportation system was also found to be less effective since they have only one transfer station and thus have to travel long distances thereby making the frequency of trips high; this is not only a wastage of time, money, man power and fuel but also increases air pollution,"" the report read./Besides, JMC has no proper mechanism for disposal of MSW, due to which the garbage is dumped in uncontrolled open dumping sites, leading to increased air pollution, soil contamination, ground water contamination. These open landfill sites produce leachate that contains concentrated toxic chemicals./As per the report, the estimated generation of daily MSW in the city is about 1,000 TPD to 1,100 TPD (tonnes per day), collected through sweeping of the communal waste storage sites. The quantity of waste generally transported each day is 900 TPD, which is about 85% of the total waste generated in the city. The quantity of waste generally transported each day is 900 TPD, which is about 85% of the waste generated. Remaining solid waste is transported during special weekly or fortnightly drives. While some roads are cleaned everyday and some periodically, others are looked at twice a week or once a week./Moreover, dust bins in the city were very dirty and overflowing. People often throw garbage outside the bins and on roads. These acts attract rag pickers and stray animals which present very ugly scene. Such scenes have become regular at many places in the morning and thick black smoke spread over large areas on the roads due to burning of leaves, plastics and other wastes./Box/16% increase in solid waste since 2001/According to JMC, around 1,024 TPD solid waste is collected every day which is around 80% of the waste generated, therefore the estimated quantity of waste generated in the entire city is around 1,280 TPD. While the estimated quantity of waste generated in 2001 was around 1,100 TPD and 80% of that waste, comprising fresh as well as old backlog, was being transported each day. Hence from 2001 to 2010 the total municipal solid waste generated has increased by 16%./eom/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Conjunctivitis, a monsoon malady","Monsoon is here, and so is conjunctivitis. Experts tell Zeenia F Baria how to combat this illness/Cornea, cataract and lasik surgeon Dr Kavita Rao says that conjunctivitis is an inflammation or infection of the conjunctiva, the thin transparent layer of tissue that lines the inner surface of the eyelid and covers the white part of the eye. “It is is a common eye disease and may affect one or both eyes. Some forms of conjunctivitis can be highly contagious and easily spread. While it is usually a minor eye infection, sometimes it can develop into a more serious problem. It may be caused by a viral or bacterial infection, and can also occur due to an allergic reaction to irritants in the air like pollen and smoke, chlorine in swimming pools, and ingredients in cosmetics or other products that come in contact with the eyes.”/Consultant ophthalmologist Dr Keiki R Mehta has warned that conjunctivitis could assume epidemic proportions since it is spreading quickly across the state. “The last two weeks have witnessed an increase in the number of conjunctivitis cases in Mumbai. While cases are reported during the rainy season every year, this year, the occurrence is manifold./Conjunctivitis is highly contagious and spreads if a non-infected individual comes in contact with a person suffering from conjunctivitis or touches an object that has been touched by such a person after wiping his eyes. Wearing a pair of goggles helps as it acts as a barrier in rubbing the eyes and makes the patient more tolerant,” says Dr Mehta./What causes conjunctivitis/The cause varies depending on the offending agent.../Allergic conjunctivitis/This occurs commonly among people, who already have seasonal allergies. At some point they come in contact with a substance that triggers an allergic reaction in their eyes. Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis is a type of allergic conjunctivitis caused by the chronic presence of a foreign body in the eye. This condition occurs pre-dominantly with people who wear soft contact lenses that are not replaced frequently./Bacterial conjunctivitis/This is an infection often caused by staphylococcal or streptococcal bacteria from your own skin or respiratory system. Infection can also occur by transmittal from insects, physical contact with other people, poor hygiene (touching eyes with unclean hands) or by use of contaminated eye make up and facial lotions./Viral conjunctivitis/This is most commonly caused by contagious viruses associated with the common cold. The primary means of contracting this is through exposure to coughing or sneezing by persons with upper respiratory tract infections. It can also occur as the virus spreads along the body’s own mucous membranes connecting lungs, throat, nose, tear ducts, and conjunctiva./Chemical conjunctivitis/This can be caused by irritants like air pollution, chlorine in swimming pools, and exposure to noxious chemicals./Usually, conjunctivitis starts from one eye. Although it is not life threatening, patients should not be allowed to attend school or office, as they may pass on the infection to others. “Self-medication should never be attempted. People should consult an eye specialist instead of buying medicine off the counter. The treatment includes use of antibiotics and astringent eye drops,” adds Dr Mehta. Steroid eye drops available off the counter are commonly used to treat conjunctivitis. “These can lead to corneal ulcers and blindness and should never be used in this infection. Conjunctivitis is caused either by entero virus or adeno virus. While the adeno virus causes haemmorhagic conjunctivitis, which we are seeing in 10 to 20 per cent of the cases, the entero virus causes pharyngo conjunctival fever, which includes sore throat, fever and conjunctivitis,” he says./Dr Rao adds that treatment of conjunctivitis has three main goals — to increase patient comfort, to reduce or lessen the course of the infection or inflammation and to prevent the spread of the infection in contagious forms of conjunctivitis. “Contact lens wearers may need to discontinue wearing lenses while the condition is active. Your doctor can advise you on the need for temporary restrictions on contact lens wear. If conjunctivitis developed due to wearing contact lenses, your eye doctor may recommend that you switch to a different type of lens or disinfection solution,” she says./Symptoms/- A gritty feeling in one or both eyes/- Itching, redness or burning sensation in one or both eyes/- Excessive tearing/- Discharge from one or both eyes/- Swollen eyelids/- Pink discolouration to the whites of one or both eyes/- Increased sensitivity to light/- Irritation and heaviness of eyes, and sensitivity to light./What to do/- Isolate personal belongings such as tissues, soap, towel and pillow cases./- Use disposable tissues instead of handkerchiefs or towels to dab eyes./- Wash your hands thoroughly and frequently./- Gently dab tears at eye corners to prevent hemorrhages or red spots./- Avoid touching your eyes with your hands and don’t use eye cosmetics./- Soothe discomfort of viral or bacterial conjunctivitis by applying warm compresses to the affected eye. To make the compress, soak a clean cloth in warm water and wring it out before applying it gently to your closed eyelids./- For allergic conjunctivitis, avoid rubbing your eyes. Instead of warm compresses, use cool compresses to soothe your eyes./- See your ophthalmologist to help diagnose the cause and the proper course of action. Do not self medicate./<a href=""mailto:zeenia.baria@timesgroup.com"">zeenia.baria@timesgroup.com</a>/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Animals killed in road accidents too entitled to decent burial,"Belgaum: Ever wondered what happens to all those road kills? Most often they are just left to rot. But Dr Mahantesh Ramannavar, an anatomy doctor with BM Kankanwadi Ayurvedic College of KLE University in Belgaum, believes that every animal has the right to a decent burial, even road kills./Carcasses of dogs, cows, snakes, cats, and pigs are common sights on highways. Every time Dr Mahantesh comes across such a sight, he buries the animal./He always travels with gloves, masks and antiseptic lotion. “Most often these animals are run over because the driver is speeding,” says Ramannavar./Carcasses left in the open are unhygienic and lead to air pollution and can spread diseases too./“Many find my actions very strange. I feel more people should come forward to do such small jobs for the sake of the environment. One has to just lift the dead animal by its tail,” he explains. Ramannavar now has a small staff that supports him in his endeavour./“Whatever I am doing is my bit to society and the only intention is to create awareness among people on the importance of sanitation and environment,” he says./Dr Mahantesh is the first doctor in the country to dissect his own father’s body to help anatomy students understand the human body./His father had stipulated in his will that his corpse should be cut open by his doctor son for research./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Keep those teddy bears in fridges,"BANGALORE: You may find it difficult to wean your kids away from those cuddly teddy bears (soft toys)./But at least keep them for a good number of hours in the refrigerator or wash them thoroughly before handing them over to children. For, that is the best way to keep house dust mite at bay and ensure your little ones are not infected./“Soft toys are one of the common causes of allergy in children and freezing them will ensure the dust mite gets killed before children use it,” said Dr (Major) K Nagaraju, national convenor, IAP Allergy and Applied Immunology Chapter./He was elaborating on preventive strategies in respiratory allergies./With 50-70 % of the country's population suffering from one or the other allergy, closed residential structures with poor ventilation and high air pollution levels have only added to the problem./“The common cause of fatigue and sleep disturbances in both children and adults is allergy, often mistaken as common cold and neglected,” Nagaraju told TOI on the sidelines of a seminar on 'Mitigation of non-communicable diseases in children', organized by Lakeside Education Trust./He said children of allergic parents are usually born allergic and their condition worsens once they are exposed to polluted environs./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
