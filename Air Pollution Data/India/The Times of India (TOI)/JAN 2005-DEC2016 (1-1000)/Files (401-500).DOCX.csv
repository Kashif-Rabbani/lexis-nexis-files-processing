Heart attacks claim 80 lives per day in Mumbai,"MUMBAI: The 'Maximum City' takes a massive toll on the heart: 80 Mumbaikars died every day due to heart attacks between March 2014 and March 2015, up from 67 deaths daily during the same period the previous year./Data given out by BMC in response to a Right to Information query showed that 29,393 deaths due to heart attacks were registered in the city during the between March 2014 and March 2015. In the previous financial year, 24,603 Mumbaikars had succumbed to heart attacks./The seriousness of Mumbai's heart problem can be gauged from the fact that heart attacks account for a third of annual deaths in the city. For instance, 31% of the 93,254 deaths recorded in Mumbai in 2014-15 were due to heart attacks, showed the RTI data. ""We have been collating Mumbai's health data since 2010 and found that roughly 70,000 to 80,000 deaths occur every day. Heart attacks account for the biggest chunk,'' said Milind Mhaske from Praja Foundation, an NGO that brings out a white paper on the city's health every year./The present data was collated by RTI activist Chetan Kothari by filing an application under the Right to Information Act with the BMC's health department. ""Heart attacks have been the leading killers for the last 15 years. Tuberculosis comes a distant second and cancer is the third medical cause for deaths,'' said Kothari. The BMC data showed that in 2014-15, at least 19 Mumbaikars died due to tuberculosis while 18 others died due to cancer every day./A senior BMC official said heart-related deaths indicated the dominance of non-communicable diseases over communicable diseases in Mumbai. Dr N O Bansal, who heads the cardiology department of the state government-run JJ Hospital in Byculla, said, ""It is entirely possible that heart disease is the largest killer in Mumbai as there is better data collection in Mumbai than other places. Mumbaikars are not following good health habits, be it eating right or exercising right.''/Heart surgeon Dr Ajay Chaughule from Global Hospital, Parel, said, ""Coronary artery disease is a lifestyle disease worsened by urbanization. A person living in an urban area is more likely than a person living in a rural area to have heart disease."" The lack of open spaces where people can walk or exercise, easy availability of high-fat food items and sugary drinks as well massive mechanization makes urbanites more prone to lifestyle diseases like obesity, diabetes and heart diseases. ""Moreover, emerging research says that air pollution is a major cause for heart diseases and cancer. Another contributory factor is daily stress, be it at work, crossing the road or at school,'' said Dr Chaughule./Dr Bansal said people should include 20 minutes of exercise or walking in their daily schedule. computerization has robbed us of even the few steps that we would take at the workplace to move a file from one table to another. It is hence advisable to keep a check on one's blood sugar as well as cholesterol levels,"" he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution takes toll on GenY,"KOLKATA: The city's polluted air - largely a result of fume-spewing vehicles - has been taking a heavy toll on children. Around 35% of them, aged between eight and 14 years, suffer from poor lung health. It can lead to a range of disorders, according to a survey./Of the affected children, lung health of 9% affected kids has been termed 'poor' and the remaining 26% was dubbed 'bad'. While the findings have left doctors and green activists shocked, Kolkata has actually fared better than Delhi, where 40% have poor lung health, and Bengaluru, where the figure was pegged at 36%. Mumbai, with 27%, fared the best among the four metros./Conducted by Heal Foundation and Breathe Blue, the study was part of a Clean Air India Movement (CLAIM) launched across the country on Monday. It reveals that children who travel in uncovered vehicles were the worst affected. In Delhi alone, 92% of children using uncovered vehicles fared 'poor' as against just 8% of those who travelled in covered vehicles. Mumbai (79% uncovered, 21% covered), Bengaluru (86% uncovered, 14% covered) and Kolkata (65% uncovered and 35% covered) showed a similar trend. The survey was conducted among 4,000 school children./Addressing a press meet at the launch of the survey report on Monday, green activist Subhas Datta said the findings for Kolkata were not surprising since few measures have been taken to check vehicular pollution in the city. ""Less than 5% of the city's area is roadspace. A part of it is abused. So, the vehicular pollution gets concentrated in a smaller area. More than half of the city's vehicles are old and don't use clean fuel. Steps like introducing 'green channels', that involved synchronizing traffic signals that allow vehicles to cover stretches without a stop, have not been successful in Kolkata. The result has been disastrous,"" said Datta./Survey participants were put through a peak respiratory flow estimation test to detect their lung efficiency. It determines how much air the lungs can hold, how quickly one can breathe air in and out and how well the lungs receive oxygen and remove carbon dioxide./Children suffer more if they breathe polluted air for their lungs are still developing, said Parthasarathi Bhattacharya, director of the Institute of Pulmocare and Research, Kolkata. ""It has been seen that proximity to pollution increases the chances of lung disorders and reduces the efficiency of the organ. The growth in the number of vehicles in Kolkata has coincided with a spurt in the number of children with lung diseases. This can't be curbed unless we control pollution,"" said Bhattacharya./As much as 40% of Kolkata's paediatric population suffers from respiratory disorders, according to Anirban Maitra, consultant paediatric pulomologist, AMRI Hospital and RTIICS, Kolkata. ""This survey only confirms the fact that Kolkata is choking with chemicals. While it's true that vehicles are not the only source of pollution, they remain the major one in Kolkata. Pollution is a price we pay for development and we can't wish it away. But we can definitely keep it under control,"" said Maitra./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Every 4th schoolkid in Mumbai fails lung test, finds survey","MUMBAI: One in four Mumbai schoolchildren possibly has poor lung function, according to a multi-city survey released on the eve of World Asthma Day on Monday. The outlook is grimmer if one considers the national average: 35% of the surveyed children had poor lung function./The survey, covering 2,000 children in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Kolkata, has linked poor lung function to rampant air pollution in metro cities. The World Health Organisation has long held that by reducing air pollution levels, ""countries can reduce the burden of disease from stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and both chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma""./The survey, which was conducted by the Breathe Blue and Heal Foundation, graded children's lung function as excellent, good, satisfactory, bad and poor based on various international scales. Delhi's children fared the worst, with 40% having compromised lung function: 21% had poor lung function and another 14% bad lung function./Mumbai's children fared the best with 73% of the surveyed children having good lung function. Of the remaining, 13% children had poor and 14% had poor lung function. In Bangalore and Kolkata, the affected student percentages stood at 36% and 35% respectively./""Thus, about 35% of schoolchildren across metros fared badly in lung health screening test, indicating poor air quality,'' said the Breathe Blue survey./A study conducted by chest specialist Dr Sanjeev Mehta over a decade back in Mumbai showed underperforming lungs among 30% of those tested. ""At that time, scientists were too shocked with the results to accept them. It seemed difficult that air pollution could have such effects,"" said Dr Mehta./Since then studies have shown that children born to mothers in Indian cities have poorer growth in comparison to children born to Indian mothers living in western cities. A study done in Beijing showed that children born in the run-up to the Olympics in 2009 had higher birth weight than those born later (because China had taken measures to reduce air pollution),"" said Dr Mehta./Lung function tests determine how much air the lungs can hold, how quickly one can move air in and out of his/her lungs, and how well the lungs take oxygen in and remove carbon dioxide out from the body. ""The tests can detect lung diseases and measure the severity of lung problems. Poor lung function results mean compromised lung function and high possibilities of contracting pulmonary diseases,"" said the foundation's press release./Pulmonologist Dr Sujit Rajan said prolonged exposure to environmental pollutants such as nitrogen dioxides and particulate matter can impair lung function. ""But what possibly worsens the odds for today's children is their poor nutrition levels. They consume so much of readymade foodstuff containing additives and adulterants that their risk of asthma is higher than before,'' said Dr Rajan./High levels of air pollution in India, especially in the national capital New Delhi, has been in the news in recent months. ""People who have been exposed to air pollution have an increased risk to a number of diseases, ranging from poor lung function to lung cancer,'' said Dr Mehta. ""We have a lot to worry about children being exposed to pollution because lungs keep growing till the age of 25, but pollution affects their growth,'' he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Clean up Kolkata air to make it inviting: US diplomat,"KOLKATA: A senior American diplomat has cautioned that Indian cities, including Kolkata and Delhi, may have difficulty in retaining and attracting talent if they do not clean up the air./Speaking to TOI, US embassy deputy minister counselor for economic, environment, science and technology Samuel Kotis said high levels of air pollution was a growing concern among expatriates./""Air pollution affects everyone because we all breathe the same air. Its adverse impact on health is definitely cause for concern. As a father, I am worried about my son who is 16. On days when the pollution level is very high in Delhi, I ask him to stay indoors. I am sure parents in Kolkata would be concerned as well because there are days when the air here is more polluted than Delhi,"" Kotis said./The Global Burden of Disease Report, considered the gold standard in global epidemiology, assessed that ambient air pollution was responsible for 630,000 premature deaths a year, or more than one death per minute. The World Health Organization 2014 report on air pollution lists Kolkata among polluted cities. Delhi tops the chart globally./A recently published report by researchers from the University of Chicago, Harvard and Yale found that ambient air pollution is on average shaving three years of life expectancy for people in India. In a metro, the loss will be higher. Also, in a study commissioned by Central Pollution Control Board, scientists found that particulate pollution caused irreversible reduction in children's lung function. ""As a parent myself, and one who is only in Delhi for a relatively short period of time, that is a conclusion that is very troubling to say the least,"" the diplomat remarked./The US embassy in Delhi and four consulates in Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai independently monitor air quality 24 X 7 and upload the data on its websites. Though the consulate in the city is located in a relatively traffic free zone (there is restriction on movement of cars on Ho Chi Minh Street due to security concerns) and the air monitoring station is located next to a lawn in the consulate compound, the air quality is poor except in summer when heat and rain contribute to its improvement./Kotis said many American cities were facing a similar problem in the 1960s and 1970s as high pollution made the cities polluted, dirty and unattractive./""Just think of smog-laden Los Angeles of the 1960s and 70s and compare it to the much cleaner skies you can experience there to know what a difference concerted, well-planned and well-executed long-term action can make. Indian cities, including Kolkata, can also transform themselves into clean urban centers with growing economies and healthy populations,"" he pointed out./But if Kolkata fails to address the concern, it would not only have to bear the incremental cost of an ailing population, companies operating out of the city may have to pay more to executives. That is a complete reversal of the current situation where salaries in Kolkata are lower than Mumbai or Dehi./""Despite an attractive package, many may not consider an assignment in a polluted city, particularly those who have school-going children,"" Kotis said, pointing out that addressing the issue of air pollution now can also mitigate climate change for future generations./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Inhalation therapy best way to treat asthma: Experts,"JAIPUR: Summer holidays are round the corner. Most of the students would head for hill stations but for 12-year-old Ravindra Singh, it's a dream which would hardly become a reality./He is asthmatic and even in slightly cold weather, his condition deteriorates. He is suffering from asthma since childhood./Singh is not the only child who has asthma. According to city-based doctors, asthma cases are on the rise among the children because of various factors like polluted environment, hereditary respiratory problems etc./Dr Virendra Singh, director, Asthma Bhawan, said, ""There is a need to identify the actual cause of asthma attack. The patient himself has to analyse what triggers asthma attack. There are blood and skin tests available which also help in identifying the factors that trigger asthma.""/The figures of people who have undergone spirometry test in Sawai Man Singh hospital paint a disturbing picture./""In 2014, as many as 10,860 people had undergone spirometry test. It is a test to check body's pulmonary functions. In 2015 so far, 2,870 persons have undergone this test. Also, a total of 30,910 patients took treatment for respiratory diseases in 2014, and of them, 60% were suffering from asthma and allergy. Similarly, in 2015 so far, 7,760 persons have turned up for treatment,"" said Dr Ajit Singh, additional superintendent, SMS Hospital./Besides, the doctors claimed that among various factors, environmental pollution is a major cause of asthma./""The air pollution due to industries and vehicles causes asthma. Recent researches have shown that environment dust, which is high in Jaipur, also causes asthma,"" said Dr Adil Aziz, assistant professor (medicine), Sawai Man Singh Hospital./The theme of World Asthma Day, which will be observed on May 5, is 'you can control your asthma'./Doctors said the best treatment for control of asthma is inhalation therapy./""Though inhalation therapy is the best treatment, there are people who doubt its effectiveness. I have observed that unmarried girls' parents don't prefer inhalation therapy because they think it will 'reveal' to people that their daughter is an asthmatic,"" Dr Aziz said./Proper medication is important for controlling asthma. ""When proper care is not given to asthma patients, it often leads to difficulties. Poor treatment could result in the death of an asthma patient,"" said Dr Deepak Yaduvanshi, chief consultant pulmonologist with a private hospital./Dr Shubhranshu, a consultant pulmonologist with another private hospital, held a camp and screened 60 children for asthma. He said general hygiene is important to prevent allergic disorders in children in the age group of 1 to 12 years. It was also noticed that most children suffer from anaemia and parasite infestations which are a precursor of asthma./Ankit Bansal, a consultant pulmonologist, said that asthma attack occurs when a person is exposed to a trigger or irritant and breathing becomes difficult. The triggers could be pollens, bugs, chemical fumes, cold air, fungus, dust, smoke, strong odours, pollution, pets and sometimes even anger, stress and exercise. Therefore, to control asthma attacks, it is important to identify and avoid the irritant./In infants, breastfeeding for at least six months prior to giving solid food can protect them from developing asthma./Box:/Things known to cause asthma/-At home: Mites, pets, moulds/-Outside: Pollens, smoke/-At workplace: Chemicals, dusts/-Medications: Aspirin, pain medications/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
40% of Delhi schoolkids fail lung capacity test: Study,"NEW DELHI: More than a third of schoolchildren in four big cities of India suffer from reduced lung capacity, with Delhi showing the worst results, claims a new study whose results could be pointing to how air pollution is impacting the health of kids in urban India./In the survey, 2,373 kids in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata underwent a lung health screening test (LHST). Of the 735 students who took the test in Delhi, 21% were found to have 'poor' lung capacity while another 19% had 'bad' capacity./This means four out of every 10 children screened in the capital failed the test. Delhi has the worst air quality among 1,600 cities around the world, according to the World Health Organization./The students were asked to inhale and then exhale forcefully into a testing device to check their lung capacity.

Green panel rap on govt for not using chimney at Swargadwar,"BHUBANESWAR: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Tuesday came down heavily on the state government for its failure to effectively run the scientific chimney at Swargadwar (crematorium) in Puri./To check pollution, the Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB) installed the chimney at the crematorium in September, 2014, and handed it over to Puri municipality for operation. But the chimney has not been put to proper use, resulting in ambient air pollution. The board recorded emission of 727 microgram per metre cube of particulate matter from the cremation ground against the permissible limit of 100./""The chimney should be made fully functional before July 30, the next date of hearing on the matter. If the officers concerned fail to comply with the direction, we will be compelled to take coercive steps against them and the state government as well,"" said the NGT order./In 2013, green campaigner Subhas Dutta filed a petition before NGT, regarding pollution in Puri due to smog emanating from the cremation ground. Earlier, the tribunal had directed the pollution board to take up plantation at the crematorium./Regional officer (Bhubaneswar) of OSPCB Hadibandhu Panigrahi said Puri municipality was not taking enough steps to encourage people to use the platform, where the chimney has been set up, to burn bodies. ""The chimney has the capacity to suck 12,000 micro gram dust and smog an hour. The emission of particulate matter will remain within the permissible limit if it is used properly,"" he said./Around 30 bodies are cremated in eight chullahs at Swargadwar every day. ""The smoke from burning body parts can cause pulmonary diseases,"" Panigrahi said./Executive officer, Puri municipality, Manish Agrawal said the chimney has not been made fully operational due to some technical problems. ""We are taking steps to convince people to burn bodies at the chullah, where the chimney has been installed.

Trucks now pass through residential areas,"Meerut: Keeping trucks out of city limits before 10pm and after 6 am is losing its purpose with the expansion of Meerut city over the past 20 years./Trucks bound for districts such as Bulandshahr and Hapur ply on the city's periphery during the day and avoid entering city limits. However, with new residential areas such as Prabhat Nagar, Mangal Pandey Nagar, Jagriti Vihar and Shastri Nagar,coming up since the mid-90s, these old ""bypasses"" have effectively become city roads./""This is true. There are areas within the city that are open for trucks despite the fact that we do not allow trucks within city limits. On paper, these roads are still bypasses but with the expansion of housing areas, these trucks now pass through residential areas,"" said SP (traffic) PK Tiwari./Regional pollution control officer (Meerut division) BB Awasthi told TOI, ""The acceptable limit of particulate matter levels (PM10) prescribed by the government is 100 micrograms per cubic metre while PM10 levels in Meerut is close to 140. On the other hand, at around 50 micrograms per cubic metre, Meerut's gaseous matter level is less than the acceptable levels of 80. This means that the main source of pollution in the city is vehicular dust and emissions. Trucks are particularly harmful since they run on diesel. A proper traffic plan needs to be put in place if this problem has to be solved.""/A total of 3,606 heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) ply on Meerut roads every day and 1,584 of these are over 10 years old. Emissions from trucks so close to residential areas is a health hazard, doctors say. ""There are residential areas around which there is a high concentration of trucks. It is only natural that noise and air pollution will affect people's health. The most vulnerable sections are children, pregnant women and senior citizens. The immunity system in children is not fully developed while senior citizens have weakened respiratory tracts,"" said Dr Ankur Gupta, a city-based doctor./Sunil Kumar Patel (50), who owns a shop in Saket residential area, said, ""Trucks go by in front of my shop all day. The problem is not on straight roads but in places where there are crossings. I've seen accidents near the Saket petrol pump crossing. Bikers are most at risk since they make sharp cuts and don't wear helmets.""/Retired serviceman RP Singh (76), a resident of Shastri Nagar, near Garh road, said, ""We have to be very careful while crossing the road. Most of these truck drivers drive too fast and I suspect they are drunk too. A man from my native village was run over about five years ago and residents are constantly worried. I doubt they have even got proper pollution checks done.""/Garh road also has some of the city's biggest hospitals such as Lala Lajpat Rai Medical College. LLRM chief medical superintendent (CMS) Dr Subhash Singh said, ""It would be much better if diversions are found for these trucks. High levels of pollution even affect healthy people so it can't be good for people who are already suffering from respiratory diseases. We should have an expressway system like in the US. They should make new routes away from the city.""/While Tiwari told TOI that there is no immediate solution to this problem, the administration has started taking some measures. ""We need to sit and decide what needs to be done but in the meantime; we have started construction of a new bypass. This new road will connect LLRM to Hapur road. At least, trucks going to Hapur can take this route and avoid some residential areas.""/However, this stretch is only one of the several stretches which are open for trucks. ""For the other areas, we keep conducting drives. We have enforced a speed limit on many roads such as the Modipuram bypass, Kankarkhera bypass, Baghpat road, Hapur road and Garh road. We fine drivers who cross the speed limit and don't have proper documents, including proper pollution check certificates. Traffic police has even put up several hoardings that implore drivers not to speed. However, given how the size of private advertisements is so huge and we can only put up hoardings of a particular size, our warnings have become blind spots,"" said the SP (city)./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Breathing dust, toxins round the year","For the second time in a month, 10-year-old Rohit Pandey, a resident of Vipul Belmonte on Golf Course Road, had a severe asthma attack. His condition stabilized only after he was admitted to a hospital's intensive care unit and put on oxygen./The Pandeys moved to Gurgaon from Pune in 2010 when Rohit was just five. He developed breathing problems at the age of seven. ""When I was in Pune, I used to play football for three hours daily. I could also run for 30 minutes at a stretch. After I was diagnosed with asthma and advised by doctors to stay indoors, I was forced to give up outdoor sports. Now I feel like a prisoner in my own house,"" says Rohit./Doctors are convinced increasing levels of air pollution, caused by construction dust, have been triggering his chronic disease. ""Pollution caused by construction dust can have a fatal effect as it increases the level of PM 10 (particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter that are capable of penetrating deep into the respiratory tract and causing health damage) and metal dust in air. These particles accumulate in the lungs and reduce their oxygen-holding capacities, which may lead to lung cancer, bronchitis, sinusitis, asthma, fibrosis, silicosis, etc. All these are non-curable disease,"" says Dr Himanshu Garg, pulmonologist at Artemis Hospital./The levels of PM2.5 (fuel pollutants) are also high because of the high volume of vehicular traffic on the road and diesel generators used by various construction sites on and around it. Housing societies, too, use generators for power backup./Like the Pandey family, many who chose to buy premium apartments on Golf Course Road didn't quite bargain for living in a dustbowl, leading to major health problems. Living at this address is costly, whether as a flat owner or on rent, but the failure of civic authorities to check dust pollution triggered by mega infrastructure projects on the road is proving costlier for residents' health./The impact of dust pollution is felt more severely by construction workers, who stay at the sites. Some said gloves and masks were given to them in the days right after the National Green Tribunal ordered their mandatory use on April 7 but not any more. ""Protective gloves and masks were given to us for only two days, when some officials came for inspection. Our families are directly exposed to construction material. Sometimes, it leads to inflammation and reddening of skin,"" said a construction worker./At some construction sites visited by this correspondent, only engineers and senior staff were found wearing protective gear to cover their hands and faces. At just one site, construction workers were seen wearing gloves and masks./Not just air pollution, residents living in townships alongside Golf Course Road also complain of rising levels of noise pollution. A 66-year-old who lives in a township in Sector 54 and suffers from a heart disease says he calls up police thrice a week. ""It has become a daily affair to carry on construction till late in the night. Loud noise from a construction site increases stress levels. Every time, we have to make complaints to 100,"" he said./TOI found out that nearly six complaints of noise pollution are made every month in three police stations ? DLF Phase I, Sector 56/57 and Sector 43 ?by people living on and around Golf Course Road./Pollution caused by construction dust also has a major impact on flora and fauna in the Aravalis. ""As the road is next to the Aravalis, massive construction hinders photosynthesis in plants,"" said Vivek Kamboj, an environmentalist. Illegal dumping of construction waste at various sites near the Golf Course Road also affects soil quality and has a negative impact on vegetation./MD Sinha, conservator of forests (Gurgaon, south circle) told TOI, ""Nature is resilient, so the construction process doesn't affect plants so much. However, if construction waste is dumped near a tree, it doesn't let roots of the tree absorb enough water. Dumping of construction waste in the Aravalis is a major issue. We have already written to the authorities concerned to keep a check on it.""/What is the way forward?/The implementation of the Union ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) guidelines of 2010 on construction is the need of the hour to regulate construction dust and air pollution./According to an official of the state pollution control board, it is mandatory for all construction companies to check air and noise pollution once every six months. ""Monitoring of pollutants and noise levels should be done by a construction company through a laboratory authorized by the ministry. The copy should then be submitted to the ministry and the state environment department that gives environmental clearances to companies,"" he said./He also urged people to come forward to highlight violations of construction norms in their area. The NGT has ordered a stop to construction at any site where the 2010 guidelines are not followed./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Vehicle ban: Centre to oppose it today,"NEW DELHI: Supported with the findings of a recent set of air pollution studies and analysis done by IIT-Delhi, Centre is set to put a strong case against the ban on 10 years old vehicles when it submits its stand before the National Green Tribunal on Monday. The findings concluded that banning such vehicles may result only 1% reduction in the atmospheric PM2.5 pollution./Sources said that the response of Centre would mention the findings while submitting that there is a need to have a comprehensive approach to reduce air pollution in Delhi and its surrounding areas. The findings of these studies have reiterated earlier studies of how transport sector contributes to about 18%-20% of total air pollution in the national capital./PM2.5 has been found to have potential health effects leading to cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer and respiratory infections. According to report, air samples were collected from Mathura Road in 2014 where average traffic flow is about 1.70 lakh vehicles per day and has substantial share of commercial traffic./In order to understand the relative contribution of different species, mass closure was attempted for PM 2.5 mass with seven key components including wood smoke, traffic and other organic matter (OM), secondary aerosol and mineral dust/ soil. It found that vehicles contribute about 18.7% and 16.2% PM2.5 pollution in summer and winter respectively. It said PM2.5 sources other than transport are also significant./The report also mentions how comparison of PM2.5 pollution on Sundays and weekdays showed that PM2.5 pollution is 6-7% lower than on Sundays than weekdays during morning hours. The difference is up to 13% in 2014 from 7 am to 8 am. However, for many parts of the day the PM2.5 levels are greater on weekdays, it also observed./It also refers to the findings of April 30 when transporters including buses, trucks and taxis went on strike. It was observed that absence of such vehicles on Delhi roads made little difference to pollution./The study concluded that a significant reduction in traffic on Sundays and strike day did not show significant decrease in PM2.5 levels. It has said if it is accepted that transport share of PM2.5 in atmospheric pollution is 17%-20%, then 5% reduction in total Pm2.5 emissions would require more than 25% reduction in vehicle numbers on road./It has also observed that banning cars older than 10 years, which is about 7% of the total car fleet, will mean only 1% reduction in the atmospheric PM2.5 pollution./The studies found that significant reduction in pollution will come if quality of fuels, especially diesel, is improved and a single standard adopted for the whole country. The action will reduce pollution from most sources in one go - transport, diesel gensets, industry and construction equipment./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
China wants Yoga-like recognition of Tai Chi by UN,"NEW DELHI: Even as New Delhi and Beijing celebrate the success of a series of bilaterals and billion dollar deals between the two nations, the two nations are engaging in a different sort of a duel. Agencies report that China now plans to push for global recognition for Tai Chi following India's successful efforts to get June 21 designated as the International Yoga Day by the UN./Chinese Premier Li Keqiang along with Prime Minister Modi attended the joint presentation of Yoga and Tai Chi performance by nearly 400 mostly Chinese and few Indian youths at the Temple of Heaven in Beijing on Friday./Later, agencies report, Chinese officials said Li wanted to get UN recognition for Tai Chi too./Yoga, which is being considered as India's tool for soft diplomacy, remained in focus during Narendra Modi's recent Chinese visit. After witnessing a display of the two ancient arts, Prime Minister Modi tweeted, ""It was a delight seeing Indian & Chinese children do Yoga and Taichi.""/Interestingly, China was one of the co-sponsors of the India-backed resolution at the UN to get June 21 declared as the International Yoga Day./Yoga will also have the spotlight turned on it at the 68th World Health Assembly in Geneva which begins from May 18 and runs till May 27./Union Health Minister J P Nadda will open a photo exhibition ""Yoga for All, Yoga for Health"" at the mega event, when India assumes its presidency after a gap of 19 years. The move is significant since the BJP-led government has promoted the spiritual and ascetic discipline ever since it came to power at the Centre./The exhibition at the WHA will also be endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) with its director general Margaret Chan launching the event along with Nadda, who is leading a high-level Indian delegation to Geneva./The Health Assembly is the supreme decision-making body of WHO. It is attended by delegations from 194 member countries and will review activities of WHO through the year and set new priorities for the future./This year, the Assembly is expected to deliberate on key issues of anti-microbial resistance, air pollution and health, global health emergency, preparedness and surveillance, global strategy and plan of action on public health, innovation and intellectual property, and research and development in neglected tropical diseases./Nadda will also participate in a number of bilateral and multilateral meetings on the sidelines of the Assembly, including the Commonwealth health ministers' meeting and BRICS health ministers' meeting./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
More women getting vulnerable to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"NAGPUR: Till recently, doctors looked at the progressive lung ailment chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a man's disease as more men have been diagnosed with the disease than women. However, it has emerged in the recent years that women suffer from the disease./This is especially true for India where, on one hand, increased modernization is leading to rising number of women smokers and on the other hand tradition dictates kitchens to use biomass fuels. With more and more women becoming part of the traditionally male bastions like armed forces, factory workers and miners, the odds of them being exposed to pollutants and particulate matter that cause respiratory disorders are also increasing./""Many women from rural areas have chronic respiratory diseases like bronchitis and COPD. The major contributor to their condition is the continuous exposure to fumes. The kitchen is usually in a corner of the house that is not ventilated too well. There is a belief that firewood used in the kitchen should not be extinguished until it does on it's on. This means smoke lingers in the house for a longer time which increases exposure manifold,"" said pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnakar./""Among rural women, exposure to indoor air pollution starts at a very early age. The structural, biochemical and cellular damage to lungs starts right in the childhood. Remaining indoors most of the time and not being much active physically only worsens the damage,"" said Mumbai-based pulmonologist Dr Sujeet Rajan. Since the actual functional damage manifests very late in life and lung function tests are not done very regularly, diagnosis is even lower./Doctors admit that not much focus has been given to women in the fight against COPD. A study from Harvard University found that women who smoke were more likely to develop COPD than men who smoke. Women smokers in certain age groups are up to 38 times more vulnerable to COPD than women who have never smoked./Dr Swarnakar quoted a study conducted by Pune-based Chest Research Foundation about other means of contribution to indoor air pollution. ""These factors include fumes from passive smoking, burning incense sticks and mosquito coils. In fact, it said that burning one mosquito coil in a closed room releases fumes equivalent to smoking 100 cigarettes,"" he said./Dr Rajan said according to available statistics 4% of Indian men above 40, and approximately 2.5% of women suffer from COPD. ""While 59% decrease in coronary heart diseases was seen in 35 years before 2004, there was 163% increase in COPD in the same period. There is gross underreporting and under diagnosis of the condition among women. Tolerance threshold of women is higher which makes them take a lot of time to complain. Plus, Indian women tend to give low priority to their health needs and they don't take decisions about their health themselves,"" he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Air pollution causes 8m deaths/yr',"NEW DELHI: Deaths due to air pollution have increased fourfold across the globe over the past decade, the latest assessment by the World Health Organization shows. The database on which the report is based shows that China and India are by far the worst affected countries./""Air pollution is one of the main avoidable causes of disease and death globally. About 4.3 million deaths each year, most in developing countries, are associated with exposure to household (indoor) air pollution. A further 3.7 million deaths a year are attributed to ambient (outdoor) air pollution,"" a report by the WHO secretariat, said. The report, titled 'Health and the environment: addressing the health impact of air pollution', is to be presented at the 68th World Health Assembly which opened on Monday in Geneva./It highlights the risks of an increasing disease burden due to polluted air at home and outside./WHO'S 2005 global update on air quality noted that more than two million premature deaths each year can be attributed to the effects of urban outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution (from the burning of solid fuels)./The latest report does not give details, but the datasets on which it is based do give break-ups of deaths due to indoor air pollution countrywise and those due to outdoor or 'ambient' air pollution region-wise./What the data shows is that of the 4.3 million deaths globally from indoor air pollution, China accounted for nearly 1.5 million and India for close to 1.3 million. Between them, the two Asian giants accounted for nearly two-thirds of the global total./As for outdoor pollution, the south-east Asian region, which includes India in the WHO categorisation, accounted for about 9.4 lakh deaths and the category that includes China had 1.7 million. The two regions were home to over two-thirds of global deaths due to this cause. While developing countries were found bearing the maximum disease burden due to air pollution even in 2005, the WHO report then had warned of rising pollution in developing countries by 2030 along with advancement of transportation, housing and other infrastructure./The latest report talks in details about the adverse effects of both indoor and outdoor air pollution on health. For instance, exposure to air pollution is a leading risk factor for non-communicable diseases, in particular: ischaemia, myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancers./Lung cancer deaths due to air pollution have also increased significantly since 2005.According to the latest report, around 30% of all lung cancer deaths can be attributed to the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution, whereas in 2005, 62,000 lung cancer deaths out of the total 1.2 million deaths each year worldwide were attributed to urban outdoor air pollution./Health ministers from around the world will deliberate on the issue and consider the recommendations made in the report during the ongoing World Health Assembly , where India has assumed presidency after a gap of 19 years. WHO member states are also expected to pass a resolution for prevention and control of adverse impacts of pollution on health during the annual health assembly ./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
GSPCB orders slaughterhouses to stop pollution,"Times News Network/Panaji: After inspecting 163 slaughtering establishments involved in the slaughtering and sale of chicken, mutton and pork, the Goa state pollution control (GSPCB) has decided to issues directions to stop pollution cause due to water being discharged into municipal drains and soak pits, failing which the board may issue closure directions./The inspection was conducted based on the direction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in the case of pollution caused due to illegal slaughtering of animals in the state./Out of 163 slaughtering-cum-retail shops identified across the state, 37 have been identified in Mapusa, 32 in Margao, 18 in Panaji, 17 in Valpoi, 12 in Ponda, nine each in Vasco and Cuncolim, three each in Bicholim, Sakhali and Pernem./Speaking to TOI, GSPCB chairman Jose Manuel Noronha said, ""We will issue directions under the Water Act for the treatment of effluent generated by the slaughtering houses.""/He also said that the slaughterhouses have to discharge effluent into the sewerage treatment plant or they should construct soak pits with oil and grease traps./An NGT bench at Pune had issued notices to GSPCB and other government authorities regarding the hearing of an application seeking strict action against violators for pollution caused due to illegal slaughtering of animals in the state. Animal rescue squad and social activist Kashinath Shetye and others had filed the application./The applicants prayed for the prohibition of all forms of slaughtering in Goa except in slaughterhouses with functioning effluent treatment plants which have permission to operate issued by the GSPCB./The applicants pointed out that the Supreme Court has identified slaughtering as one of the major polluting activities. The GSPCB should appraise and monitor the sourcing of raw material to the markets from illegal slaughterhouses, the applicants had stated./The applicants also pointed out that the prevailing conditions inside the illegal slaughterhouses are creating serious problems of water and air pollution. The petitioners alleged that the carcasses are cut into large pieces thrown on the ground, full of dirt and blood, and thus create additional sanitary problems and environmental pollution./A large meat-eating population is also being put to risk of life and health as people are not aware of the appalling conditions under which animals are slaughtered, transported and sold.

Centre resorts to selective use of IIT studies: CSE,"NEW DELHI: Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Monday alleged that the Centre resorted to ""selective use"" of studies by IIT-Delhi to argue that vehicles were minor contributors to PM 2.5 (fine, respirable particles) levels and that banning older diesel vehicles would not help in improving the city's air quality./The Union ministry of road transport and highways has so far submitted three scientific studies to substantiate their argument against the ban on old vehicles. Two of them are by Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Programme (TRIPP) of IIT-Delhi and another by University of Birmingham, Desert Research Institute, Reno and the Central Road Research Institute. The ministry has also tried to argue that the transport sector's contribution to air pollution may have been overestimated by people. But CSE said two important issues have been hidden from the NGT bench the impact of diesel fumes from vehicles in the breathing zone and the toxicity of diesel, which is graded as a carcinogen by WHO./""While resorting to number crunching to prove that vehicles do not contribute much to ambient PM2.5 levels, the IIT-study and the affidavits are silent on health risks from direct exposure to vehicular fume, especially diesel fume that is of bigger concern. While the NGT order covers all old diesel vehicles in both private and commercial segments across the NCR, this study focuses only on old cars in Delhi to stop the NGT ban,"" CSE said in a statement./It assessed the IIT-D studies that were submitted to NGT and said they could be misleading. The study states that the number of vehicles in the 11-15 years' age bracket is very small only 6% of the total fleet, which contributes 1% to PM 2.5. ""The emission load from diesel vehicles that are 11-15 years' old and meet older emissions standards emit a lot more on a per vehicle basis than those that are between 1 and 10 years' old. Compared to a BS-IV car, a 15-year-old diesel car emits 7.6 times higher particulate matter and 3.4 times higher NOx,"" CSE added./Emissions from one old diesel car are equal to that from four to seven new cars. ""A 10-year old diesel car emits 2.4 times higher PM./Removing old vehicles will reduce direct exposure substantially. This benefit will be much higher if the old diesel trucks are also removed or bypassed,"" CSE said./CSE also pointed out that PUC norms are extremely lax for BS I and BS II diesel vehicles, which fall under NGT's ban category. Globally the smoke density norms for diesel vehicles are much tighter including in Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and Singapore. CSE's review of the PUC norms has shown that PUC tests can barely fail maximum of 6% vehicles, they said reacting to ministry's argument that NGT's ban should be fitness based./""It is inexplicable why MoRTH has considered the estimates of only one study on the estimates of vehicles' contribution to PM 2.5. The IIT-D study fails to highlight the health risk from the direct exposure to vehicular fume that is of serious concern globally. Vehicular emissions take place within our breathing zone,"" the environmental think-tank said./For example, studies by Health Effect Institute have shown that the influence of vehicular pollution is maximum up to 500 metres from roadside and more than half of Delhi's population lives within this breathing zone, the statement said. CSE also said that IIT-D had not guided the government and NGT about the toxic risk and the fact that WHO and IARC have classified diesel exhaust as class-I carcinogen for its strong link with lung cancer./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Did I jeopardize my kids' health by moving to Delhi?,"Gardiner Harris was the South Asia correspondent of the New York Times for the last three years. He writes a very grim account of pollution in Delhi. Many will feel Harris's account is exaggerated, but if this is how expats feel about the city's air, there is a clear risk of Delhi being regarded as a blackhole in Western capitals. That, in turn, could threaten India's quest for economic growth and global stature./NEW DELHI: For weeks the breathing of my 8-year-old son, Bram, had become more labored, his medicinal inhaler increasingly vital. And then, one terrifying night nine months after we moved to this megacity, Bram's inhaler stopped working and his gasping became panicked./My wife called a friend, who recommended a private hospital miles away. I carried Bram to the car while my wife brought his older brother. India's traffic is among the world's most chaotic, and New Delhi's streets are crammed with trucks at night, when road signs become largely ornamental. We undertook one of the most frightening journeys of our lives, with my wife in the back seat cradling Bram's head./When we arrived, doctors infused him with steroids (and refused to provide further treatment until a $1,000 charge on my credit card went through). A week later, Bram was able to return home./When I became a South Asia correspondent for The New York Times three years ago, my wife and I were both excited and prepared for difficulties - insistent beggars, endemic dengue and summertime temperatures that reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit. But we had little inkling just how dangerous this city would be for our boys./We gradually learned that Delhi's true menace came from its air, water, food and flies. These perils sicken, disable and kill millions in India annually, making for one of the worst public health disasters in the world. Delhi, we discovered, is quietly suffering from a dire pediatric respiratory crisis, with a recent study showing that nearly half of the city's 4.4 million schoolchildren have irreversible lung damage from the poisonous air./For most Indians, these are inescapable horrors. But there are thousands of others who have chosen to live here, including some trying to save the world, others hoping to describe it and still others intent on getting their own small piece of it. It is an eclectic community of expatriates and millionaires, including car executives from Detroit, tech geeks from the Bay Area, cancer researchers from Maryland and diplomats from Dublin./Over the last year, often over chai and samosas at local dhabas or whiskey and chicken tikka at glittering embassy parties, we have obsessively discussed whether we are pursuing our careers at our children's expense./Foreigners have lived in Delhi for centuries, of course, but the air and the mounting research into its effects have become so frightening that some feel it is unethical for those who have a choice to willingly raise children here./Similar discussions are doubtless underway in Beijing and other Asian megacities, but it is in Delhi - among the most populous, polluted, unsanitary and bacterially unsafe cities on earth - where the new calculus seems most urgent. The city's air is more than twice as polluted as Beijing's, according to the World Health Organization./So many of our friends have decided to leave that the American Embassy School - this city's great expat institution - is facing a steep drop in admissions next fall. My pastor, who ministers to a largely expat parish here, told me he feared he would lose 60% of his congregants this summer./We nearly left two years ago, after Bram's first hospitalization. Even after his breathing stabilized, tests showed that he had lost half his lung function. On our doctor's advice, we placed him on routine steroid therapy and decided that as long as his breathing did not worsen again, we could stay in Delhi./Or at least I decided that. My wife seriously considered flying home immediately, and at the end of a summer visit to the United States with the kids months later, sobbed for hours on the return flight to Delhi./But after our second year here, Bram seemed fine. His earlier difficulties, though, led me to call some leading air pollution experts. The conversations were sobering./""Knowing that I was putting my kids in a place that compromised their health for their lifetimes would be very difficult given all of the scientific evidence,"" said W James Gauderman, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California. He is the co-author of a landmark 2004 study showing that children raised in parts of Los Angeles - where pollution levels are a fraction of Delhi's - face significant and probably permanent losses of lung function./Sarath Guttikunda, one of India's top pollution researchers, who moved to Goa, to protect his two young children, was unequivocal: ""If you have the option to live elsewhere, you should not raise children in Delhi.""/These and other experts told me that reduced lung capacity in adults is a highly accurate predictor of early death and disability - perhaps more than elevated blood pressure or cholesterol. So by permanently damaging their lungs in Delhi, our children may not live as long./And then there are nascent areas of research suggesting that pollution can lower children's IQ, hurt their test scores and increase the risks of autism, epilepsy, diabetes and even adult-onset diseases like multiple sclerosis./It's not just the air that inflicts harm. At least 600 million Indians, half the total population, defecate outdoors, and most of the effluent, even from toilets, is dumped untreated into rivers and streams. Still, I never thought this would come home to my family quite as dramatically as it did./We live in a four-year-old, five-story apartment building that my wife chose because its relatively new windows could help shut out Delhi's appalling night time air. About six months after we moved in, one of our neighbors reported that her tap water suddenly smelled like sewage./Then the smell hit another neighbor and another. It turned out that the developer had dug open channels for sewage that had gradually seeped into each apartment's buried water tank. When we pulled up the floor tiles on the ground floor, brown sludge seemed to be everywhere./Most piped water here is contaminated. Poor sanitation may be a crucial reason nearly half of India's children are stunted./The list of health threats sounds harrowing when considered together, but life goes on and can be quite nice here. Our apartment building eventually installed aboveground water tanks. My children's school and travel in the region are terrific, and many expats are far more influential here than they would be in their home countries./Yet one afternoon this spring, someone in our neighborhood burned something toxic, and an astringent cloud spread around our block. My wife was out walking with a friend, and their eyes became teary and their throats began to close. They bolted back inside our apartment where they found Bram gasping again, for the first time in two years. In some places in Delhi, the levels of fine particles that cause the most lung damage, called PM2.5, routinely exceed 1,000 in winter in part because small trash and other fires are so common, according to scientists. In Beijing, PM2.5 levels that exceed 500 make international headlines; here, levels twice that high are largely ignored./There is a growing expatriate literature, mostly out of China, describing the horrors of air pollution, the dangers to children and the increasingly desperate measures taken for protection. These accounts mostly end with the writers deciding to remain despite the horrors./Not this one. We are moving back to Washington this week./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Toxic air: China fixed Beijing air with iron hand,"NEW DELHI: The air Beijing was inhaling a couple of years ago was as toxic as Delhi's, but the Chinese capital had managed the crisis quickly and effectively. Experts say China's strategies were stringent and aggressive./Beijing barred registration of diesel cars as early as 2003. It implemented China V emission standards in 2013 while India is still following BS IV norms. They have a four-level alarm system to respond to severe air pollution episodes like shutting down industries, reducing usage of private vehicles, closing schools depending on how bad the pollution levels are./Not long ago, Beijing too went through a similar phase when there was massive criticism from the international community and expatriates had started leaving the city to avoid exposure to the toxic air. A report in Los Angeles Times published on June 20, 2014 talks about how expatriates started leaving because their children couldn't have enough physical activity outdoors or because they were falling sick and it was becoming a huge economic concern for China./On March 21, 2014, BBC reported what prompted an American couple to decide to leave the city after working there for five years. There are similar stories of expats fleeing China during the worst air pollution episodes. But China's response to the problem was swift./""China did go through a similar phase when there was international glare on Beijing's air pollution. There were media reports that their tourism was getting affected. When Hong Kong had high pollution levels, even offices started shifting out. But China managed to address it quite comprehensively,"" said a researcher who doesn't wish to be identified./According to an analysis by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), during 2011-14, over 1.4 million vehicles older than six years were retired or replaced in Beijing. It also introduced an environmental labeling system-Yellow: Euro I gasoline, Euro III diesel; Green: Euro IV; Blue: Euro V. This also includes use of electronic tags, and embedded chips in vehicles since 2009 so that information about the vehicle can be stored and remote reading can be taken./Vehicles without labels are illegal on Beijing's roads. It helps them identify, which vehicles could be polluting. For example, traffic restriction on yellow label vehicles began in 2003. China will eliminate yellow label vehicles in key regions by the end of 2015 and from the entire country by the end of 2017./""India, unlike China, lacks a comprehensive clean air plan. Here, we have an AQI that does not take into account the dreadful emissions from the industrial sector and particularly the coal-fired power plants, which are responsible for more than 50% of the particulate matter emissions in the country. This is simply unacceptable. India needs to adopt a national clean air plan similar to that of China,"" said Aishwarya Madineni, campaigner, Greenpeace./China also has advanced in-use vehicle emission testing system. ""They (China) introduced 20,000 buses, including CNG-run ones by 2008, Metro and light railway, imposed restrictions based on odd and even number vehicles; stringent control on emissions from industry, power plants, etc,"" CSE's assessment said. About 20,000-30,000 polluting heavy duty trucks that ply through Beijing figure in ""smoke blacklist"" and are fined by authorities./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Making Ludhiana a better place to breathe,"LUDHIANA: These young innovative minds of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College may help reduce air pollution with smokeless biomass briquettes machine with waste materials like saw dust, coffee husk, coconut shells, agro-waste and paddy straw./A group of final year B Tech (mechanical) students - Akarsh Raj, Aryaman, Amrinder Singh and Baljinder Kumar - have made a project entitled 'fuel cake machine' and with the help of this they have utilized agriculture waste to make high density fuel briquettes. Importantly, these briquettes are eco-friendly and have more calorific value./Explaining their project, Akarsh said: ""This project is about recycling waste material. Moreover, it is the best utilization of agriculture waste like coffee husk, paddy straw etc which are a great cause of air pollution. Under our project, all these waste material will be used to smoke free fuel.""/Further, Aryaman explained: ""Firstly, the raw material is grinded properly and then a starch binder is mixed into it. Basically, it is this starch binder that makes it smoke less. Then with the help of air compressor raw material is compressed and then we put it under sunlight and after some more technical proceeding, we make briquette.""/He added: ""This briquette has more calorific value, moreover it has less ignition time. It not only burns without odour, it is environment friendly too.""/Further Amaninder Singh said: ""These briquettes can be used for domestic (like ironing, cooking, cooking) and industrial use. In an industrial city like Ludhiana such eco-friendly and smoke free briquettes will help reduce air pollution. Moreover, it is also a good waste management method.""/It took almost four months to assemble this machine and it costs around Rs 11,000./""We wanted to make our project on waste management then gradually decided to make a briquette machine. Generally briquette machines are available at a very high cost. It starts from Rs 7 lakh. Our machine is cheaper, but its productivity is also less,"" said Akarsh./He also said that, with some modification in this machine they can also use the waste from municipal corporation to make briquettes./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
City night air heavy with pollutants,"BENGALURU: If you are taking a joyride or getting a cab home after work at midnight, think twice before sliding down the car window and breathing in deeply. That cool, pleasant breeze is probably bringing in pollutants as well. Air pollution is no longer at its worst only during the day-researchers have started observing midnight pollution as well./Midnight pollution, an effect of meteorological conditions, is a phenomenon observed in highly populated cities with poor air quality such as Beijing and Delhi. Large amounts of respirable suspended particulate matter are released into the air during the day from vehicles. Most of these are pushed to the upper levels of the atmosphere due to high daytime temperatures./""But during night hours, especially around midnight, when the temperature drops, the suspended particles come closer to earth's surface,"" said Vaman Acharya, chairman, Karnataka state pollution control board.This has started bothering Bengaluru, he said./A senior pollution control board official said data from monitoring centres shows that the pollutant levels at night are at least 1.5 times higher than the national particulate matter limit of 100 ugm3. ""The phenomenon has been observed more in the last year. In some places in the city, the levels are double or triple the national limit. Central Silk Board, Victoria Hospital, AMCO Batteries along Mysuru Road and Graphite India in Whitefield are the places where pollution levels are high, even at night,"" he said./The official explained that the occurrence of midnight pollution is described by the 'inversion effect'. ""As temperature and corresponding air pressure drops at night, pollutants start colliding and descending. These are charged particles. This usually happens between 11.30pm and 1.30am, with the effect peak ing at midnight. The particles settle on the road and other surfaces. By morning, when temperature goes up and vehicle movement starts, they start disintegrating,"" he said./Environmentalist Naveen KS said cleaning the road surface early in the morning is crucial.""If the particles are not cleaned from the road surface, they start rising once traffic increases dur ing the day,"" he said./So what is the solution?/Acharya explains that it can only be controlling the number of vehicles and tackling traffic congestion. ""It has been observed that when movement of vehicles in the city is smooth, the concentration of suspended particles is less. The transport authorities should think about this,"" he said./Times View/Aspiring to meet benchmarks set by global cities doesn't mean trying to compete with their abysmal air-quality standards as well.Bengaluru's air quality has deteriorated rapidly in the last decade, and midnight pollution is a wake-up call to the fact that our actions have lasting effects. The cars may be garaged at night, but the smoke they've spewed continues to poison us.Improving public transport, advocating environmentally friendly transport, and sensitizing citizens to the dangers of polluting are vital to keep the vision of a Garden City from going up in smoke./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Foul air hems in people with breathing problems,"NEW DELHI: As the city's air goes from bad to unbreathable, expats can talk about returning home, but for people heavily invested here-native-born Delhiites and others who have built up their careers and raised families in it-there's no escape./The falling air quality is taking a toll on the health of lakhs of asthmatics and people with impaired lung function. Exposure to air in heavy traffic triggers severe wheezing immediately, and emergency hospital visits have shot up over the years. Bharati Chaturvedi, an environmentalist who has had asthma most of her life, stays in her bedroom on severe smog days. ""I have stopped walking my dog on such days. I can't. Both 2013 and 2014 were terrible for me.""/Bharati says her asthma complications were seasonal in childhood but now they can happen any time. She has installed an air purifier in her bedroom. ""I am on steroid medicines and inhaler most of the time but I refuse to leave the city. The government's bad policies shouldn't throw me out of my house, right?""/Bharati is a birder and her asthma subsides when she is out birding in rural Haryana. She wants the government to treat air pollution as a state emergency and take private diesel vehicles off the roads./Rahul Goel, who works at a coffee shop in Connaught Place, cannot ride his bike without using a handkerchief as a mask. ""If I spend even a few minutes in traffic with my nose and mouth exposed, I need an inhaler. I feel like I will collapse, the wheezing is so bad."" Goel, who has bronchial asthma, had an attack two years ago after he came back from Kerala. He said he never had such complications when he was studying in Calicut. ""I want to move to Uttarakhand or Himachal Pradesh for a better life. In the past six years my life has become difficult, I don't want to tie a handkerchief around my face every day.""/Kiran Devi, who is being treated at Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, also avoids stepping out of her house. She has two children to take care of and worries about having an emergency. ""I am much better when I am at my uncle's village in Haryana. But I don't get to go there often,"" she said./Suhasini Mukherjee's asthma attacks have become frequent ever since she came to intern in Delhi from Pune. ""It gets worse after March and Diwali is horrible for her. She wheezes heavily amid exhaust smoke,"" said Chitra Mukherjee, her mother./Ameeta Mulla Wattal, principal of Springdales School, Pusa Road said a lot of students call in sick on smog days and around Diwali. ""They carry puffs and their physical activity is reduced dramatically during those days. We conduct a health study of students every year and have been seeing a rise in asthma, diabetes and psychosomatic diseases.""/Pollution does not cause asthma but it worsens it. Dr Vikram Jaggi, director of Asthma Chest and Allergy Centre says asthma is common in Australia and New Zealand although the air is clean. ""Air pollution affects lung health and function in general. In an extremely polluted city, the effect is similar to breathing six to seven cigarettes. It affects children and the elderly the most because their airways are smaller and weaker.""/Allergies and air pollution are linked, said Dr S K Chhabra, head of cardio-respiratory physiology at Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute. It aggravates allergies and is linked to chronic bronchitis and heart failure. Doctors also said some of air pollution's effects on health are invisible./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Reduction in health budget just rumours: J P Nadda,"In an exclusive interview, health minister Jagat Prakash Nadda said improving the healthcare delivery system was one of the key priorities of the Modi government. He also said talk about reduction or no increase in allocation for health was a myth./Q: Increasing pollution has emerged as a key issue. Delhi's air quality is a major concern. What is your ministry doing about it?/A: Yes, certainly, air pollution is a major concern and we are at the receiving end because of its impact on public health. But it is related to many other departments and ministries that are involved in this issue. We are taking it up with them and will make a coordinated effort to address the issue. We are also concerned./Q: Improving healthcare delivery has been on top of your government's agenda. What health schemes, programmes and projects are being devised to improve this?/A: Improving healthcare delivery has been one of the key priorities of our government. Public health being a state subject, we are working with states and supplementing their efforts to improve healthcare in the spirit of cooperative federalism. Our endeavour has been to consolidate work and devise specific initiatives to address critical gaps like improving quality and, specifically, swachhta in public health facilities. We launched National Quality Assurance Framework and Kayakalp. To reduce high out of pocket expenditure, we are giving a big push to free drugs and diagnostics in public health facilities. For reducing preventable mortality and morbidity, we have approved addition of four new vaccines under the Universal Immunisation Programme. We are also working to use information and communication technologies in healthcare in a big way, which we believe can have a transformational effect in the way healthcare delivery is provided. By August, we will be sending 78 weekly audio health messages to pregnant women and new parents appropriate to the stage of pregnancy and age of infant. We will also use mobile phones to train ASHA workers and ANMs. To improve access to affordable super-specialty care and to provide high quality specialist workforce and give thrust to research and knowledge creation, we have sanctioned several more AIIMS./Q: It must be tough to cover the increasing population given that there has been no increase in budget allocation. How do you plan to fund these schemes?/A: First of all, I wish to dispel this myth about reduction or no increase in allocation. It is true that there has only been a slight increase in allocation in the Union Budget compared to last year's revised estimate. But we have to remember that states have been given over Rs 180,000 crore more in share of taxes and they are expected to contribute more money for the health sector. So, the total kitty for the health sector will grow this year. We certainly expect that states will put in additional resources. We are working with states to improve efficiency in use of funds. Although we continue to seek more funds for healthcare, improving the capacity of states to absorb funds is another area that we have to continuously strive, else increased resources will not translate into improved health outcomes./Q: India's low healthcare spend has not been received well by the international community. Is it possible to make basic healthcare accessible to all with the given resources?/A: I admit that there is certainly a need to improve our healthcare spend and the Union and states will have to together provide more resources to provide accessible and affordable healthcare of good quality. Yet, states' absorptive capacities also need to improve and these will not improve overnight but incrementally. For improved health and developmental outcomes at low cost, we are working to make primary healthcare more robust, comprehensive and accountable. This will encompass preventive, promotive, curative and rehabilitative health care./Optional trim/Q: You have just come back from the 68th World Health Assembly in Geneva, what are the key takeaways?/A: India assuming the presidentship of the WHA is not just about the challenges that global health faces today but also recognition of the commitment that the country has shown in the field of healthcare delivery. One of the major takeaways is the fact that global strategies are built around the experiences of individual countries. We need a global strategy, which will have to be country led for implementation. Issues like antimicrobial resistance, non-communicable diseases, immunization are on top of the global agenda. Health of women and children continue to be major areas of concern. As president, I would like to have consensus on the way forward on all these major global health challenges./Q: What is the status of health ministry's ambitious National Health Assurance Mission which promised essential medicines, diagnostic services etc. When are you planning to launch it?/A: The National Health Assurance Mission is really a process, focused essentially on free drugs, free diagnostics, preventive and promotive healthcare, primary healthcare, secondary healthcare and a selected set of tertiary care. Most of these continue to be areas of emphasis through the National Health Mission. Movement in the direction continues./Q: You have personally taken interest to make the immunisation drive successful. What are the plans and have you fixed any timeline?/A: We would like to ensure that no child dies of a vaccine preventable disease. In the process, we have to have a plan to reach every child. No child should be left out. Mission Indradhanush is a programme as well as passion for me. We need to take the coverage to 90%. We are also introducing new vaccines. We have to take this movement forward so that we are on target by 2020. This means very active participation by states. I am regularly in touch with state governments. The first two rounds of Mission Indradhanush have shown good results. We need to do better./Q: Is there a possibility of launching schemes, which were part of NHAM, separately?/A: Yes, we are already supporting and encouraging states to implement initiatives for free drugs and free diagnostics, comprehensive primary healthcare and strengthening district hospitals. The RSBY scheme has been transferred to my ministry from the ministry of labour. We are redesigning certain aspects of the scheme, like we intend to encompass certain elements of primary care such as screening for hypertension and diabetes and also provide for their free treatment./Q: How will India meet the new sustainable development goals on maternal and infant mortality rate, to be soon adopted by the United Nations?/A: No doubt, India's MMR, under-five mortality rate and IMR are high. However, we have to be mindful of the baseline at which we began, and the constraints of capacity and low human resources in our diverse states. Despite these, we have shown accelerated decline on these parameters. With improved capacities, resources and programmes based on evidence, we are very hopeful that we will meet the proposed new sustainable development goals./Q: Civil society has raised concerns on the delay in implementation of larger pictorial warnings on tobacco packs./A: The ministry is committed to the tobacco control programme as well as the pictorial warning issue. I have said this on the floor of the House as well. We are awaiting the report of the Parliament committee./Q: Your government has completed a year. How would you rate it and what is the vision?/A: As far as health is concerned, we are steadily moving towards accessible and affordable healthcare for all. We have taken key initiatives and the world's largest public health programme is being undertaken. We have also gone forward on the newborn action plan. We are steadily progressing in all areas including elimination of Japanese Encephalitis, tuberculosis etc. The aim is to work in cooperation with states and make healthcare accessible to all/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution worsens heart disease: Studies,"Breathing in polluted air is injurious to your heart. Growing evidence suggests that microscopic particulate matter (PM) comprising construction dust and vehicular exhaust could, in this regard, be the worst culprit./While no statistics are available in Mumbai to directly correlate air pollutants with heart attacks, there is growing evidence in the West and some data from India as well. For instance, the World Health Organisation's Global Diseases Burden statistics showed that 6.2 lakh people had died prematurely in India from air pollution-related diseases in 2010. More than half of these deaths were triggered by heart attacks. It is believed that air pollutants, especially microscopic particulate matter, enter the airways easily and irritate the blood vessels as well. It is now well-established these pollutants lead to inflammation of blood vessels that, over a period of time and prolonged exposure, could worsen a patient's existing heart diseases (such as building up of plaque in arteries)./In fact, doctors in Mumbai believe it is time to tweak the risk factors associated with heart diseases. It has traditionally been held that heart diseases among Indians are the result of familial history or habits such as smoking or consuming calorie-rich foods. ""It is time we not only asked patients who come in with heart problems about their smoking and family history, but also about the air pollution around them,'' said Dr A B Mehta, director of cardiology at Jaslok Hospital on Pedder Road./In March 2014, WHO reported that one in eight of total global deaths in 2012 resulted from air pollution exposure. This finding doubled previous estimates and confirmed that air pollution was the world's largest single environmental health risk. ""Reducing air pollution could save millions of live,'' said the WHO report./The American Heart Association had in 2009 brought out statements linking air pollutants, especially the microscopic particulate matter (both PM2.5 and PM 10), with worsening of existing heart disease. ""A study on emergency admissions in Boston reported a significant association of NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and PM2.5 with the risk of acute myocardial infarction,'' said a large review of studies that appeared in Toxicology Research medical journal this year./It talked about a study conducted across 21 US cities that reported an association between NO2 and PM10 exposure and risk for hospitalization. ""This Intermountain Heart Collaborative Study revealed a 4.5% increase in coronary artery disease with every 10 \xECg/m3 (microgram) increase in PM2.5,'' said the review./""Given the new evidence relating air pollution and heart attacks, it is easy to surmise that air pollutants shorten people's lifespan,'' said Dr Mehta, adding ""Dr S R Kamath, who headed KEM Hospital's chest medicine department, used to tell me long back that living in the Lalbaug area can reduce one's lifespan by a decade''./Cardiologist Dr Brian Pinto said, ""While there are no research papers linking air pollution and heart attacks in India, there is no question in my mind that it affects the heart. If smog affects one's lungs, how can it not affect the heart as well?'' He said air pollutants-heart link is the reason that people are advised not to jog or exercise early in winter mornings./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution chokes city's lungs,"AGRA: Pollution levels at Bodla and Nanuhai industrial area was three to four times higher than the prescribed limit in the month of May, according to the state's pollution watchdog./The eye-watering figures hardly come as a surprise as nearly 1,000 vehicles hit city roads every month, data obtained by the regional transport department suggest./The fact that over 11,000 CNG and diesel-run autos/tempos, around 5,700 taxis, over 4,100 trucks and lorries, over 4,300 mini-buses, close to 6,000 jeeps and over 76,700 private cars throng the city's shrinking roadscape indicate that the air quality in the city of Taj can only get worse for locals./And it's not as if the issue has somehow gone under the radar. In spite of more than 20 years of judicial activism, major policy announcements and projects worth crores of rupees, the authorities have failed to rid the increasing level of toxics present in the air./In fact earlier this year, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had sent notices to Agra and seven other cities over the sharp surge in air pollution levels due to increase in number of privately-owned petrol and diesel-run vehicles. Concerned over the unchecked rise in air pollution levels in the city, the environmental protection agency had also sought recommendations from the administrations of Uttar Pradesh and other states to counter rising private ownership of multiple vehicles and ways to tackle pollution-causing vehicles./The notice came after city-based paediatric surgeon Sanjay Kulshrestha, in his letter to the NGT, wrote about how deteriorating air quality would have an ""adverse impact"" on the health of fetuses, newborn babies and children as ""they are likely to develop congenital and acquired diseases""./It's not just that the fetuses are falling prey due to air pollution. The city has witnessed a surge in the number of breathing-related ailments in the last one decade. More and more people in the city are suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), silicosis and bronchitis asthma./Dr Gajendra Vikram Singh, assistant professor of TB and chest department at the S N Medical College, confirmed the recent trend of ailments, saying: ""We are seeing 15% to 20% rise in patients coming with lung ailments and airway diseases every year. The increase in such kind of problems can only be attributed to the toxic air that has engulfed the city.""/The expert added that the region is also witnessing rise in the cases of occupational disease as a large number of people are involved in jobs like stone/marble cutting. He pointed out that special emphasis should be laid in villages where a large number of women are contracting airway diseases, as they are exposed to domestic pollution like burning domestic fuel and left-outs of agricultural processes./Surendra Sharma, social activist and environmentalist, said, ""The adulterated fuel is also a big reason for the pollution crisis in Agra. The tempo and auto drivers mix petrol with kerosene to get extra mileage in less money. We have lodged several complaints regarding the matter with the district administration, but no action has been taken so far.""/He also advised that a law should be made on fixing the number of four-wheelers a family can own and an age-limit for every car, beyond which using it would be deemed illegal./Officials at the under-fire regional transport office (RTO) said the wheels have been set in motion to phase out diesel-run vehicles by July 21, 2015. Daroga Singh, additional regional transport officer (ARTO), said the regional transport office has also started giving permits to e-rickshaws in their bid to lessen the growing menace./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Gwalior continues to be among dirtiest cities,"BHOPAL: Gwalior continues to be among dirtiest cities of the country in terms of air pollution with fresh reports indicating city having more than three times the acceptable particulate matter levels in air./""There is no change in pollution level. It's still three times more than safety level recommended by WHO,"" said an officer of pollution control board wishing anonymity. ""There are hundreds of old vehicles on road, many of them are 15 to 20 years old. Unless these vehicles are pushed off roads, pollution level won't go down,"" he said./Earlier in 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) study reported Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh's capital Raipur were among top four cities of the world with dirtiest air. WHO study of 1,600 cities across 91 countries found air pollution has worsened since 2011, especially in poor countries, putting city-dwellers at higher? risk of cancer, stroke and ?heart disease./""Air quality in most cities (including Gwalior) worldwide that monitor outdoor (ambient) air pollution fails to meet WHO guidelines for safe levels, putting people at additional risk of respiratory disease and other health problems,"" states WHO report. Only 12% of people living in cities that report air quality comply with WHO guideline levels./Delhi had an annual average of 153 micrograms of small particulates, known as PM2.5 (fine particulate matter with 2.5 micrometres or less in diameter) per cubic metre./In most cities like Gwalior, where there is enough data of previous years available it can be said that air pollution has worsened. Many factors contribute to this increase, including reliance on fossil fuels such as coal-fired power plants, dependence on private motor vehicles for transport, inefficient use of energy in buildings, and use of biomass for cooking and heating./In Gwalior, some officers blame it on vehicular pollution. Gwalior's rising air pollution is also being heard at National Green Tribunal (NGT), Bhopal bench. Authorities of the state transport department had submitted a detailed report to the NGT./Madhya Pradesh high court had taken serious note of WHO report following PIL filed by social activist and lawyer Awadesh Pratap Singh Bhadauria. State and central pollution control boards were asked to submit explanation on ""Why Gwalior is among one of the top four polluted cities of the world""./Bhadauria claimed local administration has felled hundreds of trees in the name of development but have not carried out any compensatory plantation./2013-14 data of the state's pollution control board substantiates WHO's report. Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board, which monitored vehicles across the state, found Gwalior leading other cities in MP with 23% diesel and 6.9% petrol vehicles emitting pollutants above permissible limits./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Neeri's spl van to monitor & control emissions launched,"Nagpur: After analysing the air pollution content rising majorly around busy traffic intersections and industrial areas, the city-based National Environmental Engineering and Research Institute (Neeri) has developed a special mobile van to monitor and control the emissions coming from industries and vehicles. The Union minister for science and technology, Harsh Vardhan, on Friday, announced that the Neeri's project will be taken to other metropolitan cities, starting from Delhi./In coming days, the mobile emission monitoring and control (MEMC) van developed at Neeri's laboratory will be seen around areas like Bhandewadi yard, Sitabuldi, Shankar Nagar Square, Law College Square etc. ""In all these areas we have noticed the maximum amount of dust which is the main reason for respiratory diseases,"" said Padma Rao, head of the air pollution control division, Neeri./Rao said that until now only the ambient air pollution monitoring van could be seen roaming around in the country. ""This is the first time a van is developed to monitor as well as control the pollution content found both in ambient and industrial air,""she added./She said that the city is mostly affected with particulate matter (PM 10) found to a great extent in the air and its currently a necessity to limit its amount, which they plan to do through this van./The MEMC van, developed with indigenous technology at NEERI, was inaugurated by Vardhan on Friday at the Neeri premises, Vasant Nagar, on the occasion of World Environment Day. The event was preceded by Vardhan addressing at the NEERI auditorium./""Minimizing air pollution is going to be the main motto because even the World Health Organization (WHO) has given bad result about the quality of air, especially at metro cities in India. Children are seen suffering the most,"" he said./Keeping metropolitan cities in focus, he announced that he will make NEERI responsible to perform a study to quantify the air pollution content coming from both industries and vehicles, and submit a report./Pointing to NEERI officials, Vardhan said, ""Scientist should develop some technology that saves man to enter the sewage to clean it. The labourers entering the manhole have a huge chance of getting exposed to poisonous gasses inside the sewer.""/Later, at a press conference, referring to the Maggi noodles controversy, he said, ""We now need to develop a healthy consumerism campaign. Even before the government takes action, a consumer should realize what's healthy for him to eat.""/He said that as a consumer we should understand that plastic, though cheap, is harmful for environment and should be replaced by jute or cotton. ""Why does the government have to take extreme steps and why can't the consumers understand all this beforehand,"" he said./Dr M O Garg, Director General, The Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) and Dr Satish R Wate, director, CSIR-NEERI also addressed the gathering.

Sprinklers to put out dump yard fires,"TRICHY: To keep in check fire accidents in the garbage dump yard at Ariyamangalam, a regular occurrence at the site, and curb air pollution in nearby areas, the city corporation has installed water pipelines to sprinkle water across the yard at the time of fire accidents so that it could be checked from spreading further./The 43-acre dump yard is the city's only composite yard where over 300 tonnes of garbage is dumped on a daily basis. A fleet of nearly 80 trucks make about 250 trips daily , which collect garbage from 65 wards of the corporation./A corporation official said, ""Pipelines were installed along the pathways of the yard. Water would be sprinkled from the pipelines at the time of fire accidents.""/""It takes time for firefighters to reach the spot during fire accidents at the dump yard. By the time they reach the spot, fire spreads to other areas of the yard. However, with this measure, the fire is likely to be controlled on time.""/Trichy Corporation commissioner M Vijayalakshmi said, ""Whenever there is a fire in the dump yard, firefighters are brought in to extinguish it. However, it takes time for them to reach the place. Most of the time, the fire is due to natural reasons. With the pipelines installed at place, we can instantly douse the fire and stop it from spreading further.""/While the dump yard is instrumental in keeping the city free from garbage to a certain extent, fire accidents have become common in the dump yard. Often, fire is induced by increase in temperature and on several occasion it is man-made too./Meanwhile, the dump yard has invited the ire of locals in the surrounding areas ever since its inception as they were at the receiving end directly by facing health hazard induced by severe pollution./""Not only the land is polluted in the region, often the garbage found flying to nearby areas while polluting the air. Adding up to the misery is the fire accidents in the dumping yard which is worse,"" said R Marimuthu, a resident of Kalyanaraman Street near Ariyamangalam dump yard./""The smoke emanating from the fire in dump yard affects visibility on the Thanjavur Road which has resulted in severe accidents. On several occasions, locals have staged protest against using Ariyamangalam as dump yard,"" he added./""Though measures have been taken by the corporation to check the issue by using pipelines, proper supply of water has to be ensured so that it could serve the purpose during fire accidents,"" added a local./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Act on Delhi's foul air - now',"You probably know that Delhi is the world's most polluted city. In the last one year or so, the air has become fouler, causing respiratory diseases among the young and old, impairing children's lung capacity, and raising the risk of heart diseases and lung cancer. Foreigners are alarmed, and some are quitting. Delhi is getting a really bad name abroad. How do we reverse the situation?/TOI brought environment minister Prakash Javadekar together with activist Sunita Narain, senior consultant, chest medicine department at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Dr Neeraj Jain, auto industry veteran Jagdish Khattar and Indian Oil director (refineries) Sanjiv Singh for a free-flowing discussion on what must be done to ensure that clean air is every citizen's birthright. Excerpts/Sunita Narain: After a lot of deliberations in the 90s, we realized what needed to change for cleaner air was fuel. That's when we (CSE) went to the Supreme Court. The Centre suggested introduction of CNG to the court. It was a leap frog option \xAD instead of incrementally improving the fuel, change the fuel itself. In early 2000s, we could see a distinct difference in the quality of air. There was a clear difference in the impact of polluted air on health, fewer instances of asthma, etc./But the tide started turning since 2007. There are no restraints on commercial trucks coming in to the city . In 2004, the SC asked for bypasses to the city. But 11 years have gone by , but these roads have not come. Virtually nothing has happened on eastern peripheral road, and the western is stuck because of concessionaires who were building the road. The issue is this: about 50,000 trucks come to Delhi every day and they emit poisonous smoke that's hundreds of times worse that emission of cars. On cars, there has been a sharp increase in diesel cars because of the price differential between petrol and diesel. The difference has come down now, but there's still an incentive for diesel./So, private transport is increasing, but there has been no increase in public transport. No emphasis on public transport or on a parking policy . Vehicular emissions contribute 40 to 50% of PM 2.5 emissions. Delhi's PM 2.5 emissions are from vehicles, it can't be from gensets because Delhi's power situation has improved. Gurgaon has a problem with diesel gensets./Jagdish Khattar: Gurgaon can have an effect in Delhi, so can Noida. It's the same air shed./Sunita: Let's define the sources of air pollution. Vehicles, gensets, construction dust, garbage burning, thermal power plants and industries (Delhi industries have been moved to Ghaziabad, Sahibabad, etc.) Plus stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana./Dr Neeraj Jain: As someone who sees a lot of morbidity and mortality due to this, I can say dust also plays a major impact on health. Dust is as harmful as PM 2.5 and PM 10. You travel abroad and you see where the concrete ends, greenery begins. You don't see dust./Khattar: Also, sweeping takes place at night not early morning./Dr Jain: However, traffic pollution is very important. The trucks that pass through Delhi do not allow Delhi's air to refresh. With so many trucks there are also breakdowns which lead to long tail-up of traffic which idles and causes pockets of very high emission./Sunita: But CNG did work/Dr Jain: Yes, it worked only for five years. I realized other sources of pollution as important. What's blowing in from the other states in NCR, Haryana, UP and Rajasthan, has an effect on us.We need to make a list of problems and then we need someone like minister Javadekar to instruct everyone to start work simultaneously on everything./Khattar: Yes, the situation is very serious. It's not a national problem, it's an international problem. If the government is keen on investment, air pollution is going to dissuade people from coming here. You read that article in New York Times (by Gardener Harris, carried in TOI on June 1). My apprehension is that in five years from now people from Delhi will move out. My grandsons who came from US wish to go back. Automobile is a contributory, yes.But whether it's contribution to air pollution is 30%, 40%, 10% or 20% is debatable. The reports I have gone through say its 10 to 20%. I don't think tackling other issues can be sequential. It has to be together. It's a clarion call./If I could I would give a couple of million masks to children. They can use them, and if Delhi is flooded with masks, a powerful message will go out. (Turning to the minister) And no more laws please. You bring in new laws. There are enough laws, please imple ment them now./Sunita: OK. But what do you want the minis ter to do?/Khattar: Give me a moment. Automobile are not the main culprits. The doctor is on my side. Let's have a comprehensive plan./Sunita: We've gone through that for 25 years. I'm saying the sources of air pollution are automobiles, gensets, dust, etc., but the auto lobby is always saying it's not us./Sunita Narain during a round table conference on air pollution at Times House in New Delhi. (TOI photo by Neeraj Paul)/Khattar: I am from that lobby and I'm saying it's us too./Sunita: Comprehensive doesn't mean anything.../Khattar: According to us piecemeal approach doesn't help. Let's hear the minister./Prakash Javadekar: I want to hear you before I respond./Sanjiv Singh: There are two issues in vehicular emissions: fuel and engine.Mashelkar committee report was the first to talk about improving fuel norms, and we have progressed since then. The guidelines had said Euro 3 by April 2010 but it happened in September 2010.Automobiles are definitely a visible source of pollution. To address SPM (suspended particulate matter), we have to move to Euro 5 and 6. Oil industry is committed. We are planning a Rs 80,000-crore investment for that./Sunita: We need two bypasses, stringent in-use vehicle norms for pre-2010 vehicles, implementation of construction norms, water to spray to keep dust down, we need gas for the Badarpur power plant.../Khattar: Supply of power is more than demand, shut down Badarpur.Politicians should stop giving free bijli.Electricity boards are bankrupt, they can't buy power, so they have to keep (state-owned) Badarpur plant. Has anyone studied what Beijing has done?/Sunita: They are on Euro 5 already and going to have Euro 6 by 2017. Beijing has capped the number of cars. It has an auction for registration of cars, it has very high parking rates, and a huge thrust on public transport. It has also closed down the factories in and around Beijing. Some power stations have also closed. Beijing is not doing dust management. But let's hear the minister./Javadekar: I am very happy that TOI is taking so much interest in air pollution issues. I welcome this initiative. I agree with practically everything that you have raised here. But there's a difference now./The first difference is that when the issue of Delhi's air quality was raised in Parliament, officers told us their (US Embassy) data is from only one station and it's not correct \xAD in short, the usual bureaucratic approach to say what we are doing is correct and what they are saying is not. I speak from my heart.So, I stood up and said scientifi cally you can say that Delhi's air is three times, four times bad but let's not quibble over that. The truth is Delhi's air quality is bad./That was a major departure as it showed the government was not in denial. The government accepts the problem as it is./We did two things. The Prime Minister launched AQI (air quality index).It was a way of accepting the problem and that requires political courage. If you don't want to act, you can suppress information. Today papers are report ing only PM 2.5 levels but let me tell you that while it is the worst, PM 10, NOx, SO2, CO, O3, NH3 and PB are also health hazards. It's not as if only we have a problem. Beijing had a worse problem but they rectified it. We also want to rectify it. We are committed to it and want everyone's cooperation./What we did was bring AQI \xAD one description, one number, one code \xAD for Agra, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Faridabad, Kanpur and Navi Mumbai. We want to take it to 66 cities. The acceptance of a problem is the beginning of a new solution. It's the beginning of public awareness./Environment minister Prakash Javadekar during a round table conference on air pollution at Times House in New Delhi. (TOI photo by Neeraj Paul)/It's not that just one factor is polluting our air. North India has a dhool ka problem. Yahan dhool ka phool nahi, dhool ka sankat hai. Nevada also has dhool ka sankat. Europe has ozone and benzene pollution and people there were discussing their pollution problems but that doesn't absolve us from the responsibility of doing our job./I went to see how Metro does its tunneling so wonderfully . Why can't it be done in other construction projects? We must form construction and demolition waste rules. We have invited comments and suggestions which we will incorporate. We will implement the rules from August. I have had meetings with NCR states. I sat with them twice. I have had meetings with Delhi police, NTPC, traffic. On April 13, we came out with three month plan. I made everyone to commit something./Conversion of coal-based industries to CNG will not happen in three months. As far as stubble burning is concerned, Punjab has taken the initiative. It is giving 50% subsidy for purchase of bailing machines which will bundle stubble. Haryana has filed three FIRs for stubble burning, they will do more./Then there is the question of monitoring vehicular pollution and checking it. The Bangalore model of PUC is good \xAD they put a sensor in the exhaust pipe.Right now even polluting trucks also get PUC. PUC works like an ATM. Give card, get money; here give money and get PUC. So simple./We have brought a bill for e-rickshaws. As many as 1 lakh e-ricks will come in Delhi. I can confide in you that government departments are actively considering how can we prepone Euro 4 throughout country much before 2017.Whatever we are saying is on record.Concerned ministries are working on how to advance the time table. It will happen before 2017./Sunita: That's a commitment.../Javadekar: We also have come up with norms for thermal power plants, construction waste, solid waste rules, biomedical waste rules, e-waste rules.E-waste a big problem. 30 crore mobiles go to Moradabad where they take out precious metals and leave the sets for leaching. This is the Swachch Bharat campaign. Ganga mailey isliye nahi ki papion ka pap dhote dhote \xAD industrial waste goes into it untreated, 80% sewage goes into it untreated, 14th industrial pollution is untreated. These are big issues, but they don't have a oneyear solution./The government has a political will. This is the hallmark of the Modi government./Sunita: On the bypass issue, Mr (Bhupinder Singh) Hooda has gone and now we have Mr Gadkari on the Delhi bypass project./Javadekar: Mr Gadkari has already tendered it./Sunita: The court has given a timeline for the bypass. We are monitoring work every week but there is no progress./Javadekar: Look, I believe your intentions. You should also believe ours./Sunita: The deadline for the western bypass is June 2016 and June 2018 for the eastern bypass. The eastern one is now on EPC mode. That's a good decision taken by the government. However, the cabinet cleared the EPC mode yet.Each month we are losing time. Minister, please sort it out with Haryana/Javdekar: If no eligible tender is there what will the media say if the work is given to just anyone?/Khattar: Give it to a PSU.../Javadekar: Then it will never happen.They will subcontract the work. Euro 4 before 2017, but no commitment from industry.../Singh: 2017 is challenging We didn't say we can advance it to before 2017.Even 2017 is a very very challenging task.../Sunita: So, it will be Euro 4 in the rest of the country by 2016. All petrol vehicles supply Euro 4 compliant vehicles, only truck manufacturers are having a problem and those with big interests in diesel. In trucks there is 80% difference in emissions between Euro 3 and Euro 4./Khattar: 80% for 2% vehicles.../Sunita: But it's a large number of trucks that are coming in to Delhi. And their emission, as I said, is dramatically higher than other vehicles. Diesel vehicle companies are opposing an early introduction of Euro 6. They are saying they can't do it before 2023. Prakashji have to play an imp role in this./Javadekar: Modi government is committed to tackle pollution./Khattar: You don't need a disincentive for diesel, just bridge the price gap./Javadekar: We have already deregulated diesel. We have brought the difference down./Sunita: There is still a Rs 12 difference in tax. And diesel is 5 to 7 times more polluting./Sunita: Let's have a very specific action plan with deadlines and outcomes./Dr Jain: There are enough reason to declare this as an emergency . Every day, we see people dying due to diseases that are directly or indirectly linked to pollution. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for example, is the biggest killer in the elderly population. In small children, the incidence of breathing difficulty, wheezing and asthma has gone up significantly and it will not be wrong to state that if urgent action is not taken, it will turn into an epidemic,/Sunita: We need dual strategies \xAD short term and long term./Javadekar: We are meeting again in July on the three-year road map./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
76% of e-waste workers suffering from respiratory ailments: Assocham,"LUCKNOW: About 76% of e-waste workers in India are suffering from respiratory ailments like breathing difficulties, irritation, coughing, and choking. Most of these persons are engaged in various e-waste (electronic waste) activities./All recyclers and dismantlers are suffering from breathing problems such as asthma and bronchitis and have a detrimental effect on the respiratory, urinary and digestive systems, besides crippling immunity and causing cancer, according to a study on 'Electronic Waste Management in India,' conducted by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM)./The Centre has recently launched ""Swachh Bharat Mission"" or ""Clean India Mission"" which aims to mobilise masses and seeks to create a clean India, whereas there are 10 states that contribute to 70% of the total e-waste generated in the country, while 65 cities generate more than 60% of the total e-waste in India./Among the eight largest e-waste generating states, Maharashtra ranks first followed by Tamil Nadu (2nd), Andhra Pradesh (3rd), Uttar Pradesh (4th), Delhi (5th), Gujarat (6th), Karnataka (7th) and West Bengal (8th), adds the study./The main sources of electronic waste in India are the government, public and private (industrial) sectors, which account for almost 71% of total waste generation. The contribution of individual households is relatively small at about 16%; the rest being contributed by manufacturers. Though individual households are not large contributors to waste generated by computers, they consume large quantities of consumer durables and are, therefore, potential creators of waste, reveals the ASSOCHAM study./For the recycling of e-waste, India heavily depends on the unorganised sector as only a handful of organised e-waste recycling facilities are available. Over 95% of the e-waste is treated and processed in the majority of urban slums of the country, where untrained workers carry out the dangerous procedures without personal protective equipment, which are detrimental not only to their health but also to the environment./While releasing the paper, DS Rawat, secretary general of ASSOCHAM said, e-waste is directly linked to the economic growth of the country and overall consumer spending. India's economic growth has lifted millions of people from lower-income group to middle and high-income groups, increasing their purchasing power./E-waste typically includes discarded computer monitors, motherboards, cathode ray tubes (CRT), printed circuit board (PCB), mobile phones and chargers, compact discs, headphones, white goods such as liquid crystal displays (LCD)/ plasma televisions, air conditioners, refrigerators and so on. With increasing use of these in our everyday life, e-waste is also piling up./Of the total e-waste generated in India, approximately 1.5% is recycled by formal recyclers or institutional processing and recycling. Another 8% of the e-waste generated is rendered useless and goes to landfills. The remaining 90.5% of the e-waste is being handled by the informal sector, adds the paper./E-waste accounts for approximately 40% of the lead and 70% of heavy metals found in landfills. These pollutants lead to ground water and air pollution and soil acidification. High and prolonged exposure to these chemicals/ pollutants emitted during unsafe e-waste recycling leads to damage of nervous systems, blood systems, kidneys and brain development, respiratory disorders, skin disorders, bronchitis, lung cancer, heart, liver, and spleen damage./The biggest e-waste recycling market in India is Delhi and approximately 40% of the e-waste in India lands here. Bangalore and Chennai are the next big e-waste markets. Chennai is the fourth largest e-waste generating city and approximately 5.0 MT of e-waste is generated every day in the Chennai Metropolitan area./Commenting ASSOCHAM findings Dr BK Rao, chairman of ASSOCHAM Health Committee said, ""Computers, televisions and mobile phones are most dangerous because they have high levels of lead, mercury and cadmium -- and they have short life span so are discarded more.""/In the last ten years, there is about 83.5% increase in the sales of domestic household appliances, both large and small all over the world. Electronic equipments contain many hazardous metallic contaminants such as lead, cadmium, and beryllium and brominated flame-retardants./The fraction including iron, copper, aluminum, gold, and other metals in e-waste is over 60%, while plastics account for about 30% and the hazardous pollutants comprise only about 2.70%./Dr Rao further said, Children are particularly vulnerable to lead poisoning - more so than adults because they absorb more lead from their environment and their nervous system and blood get affected./A large number of workers are involved in crude dismantling of these electronic items for their livelihood and their health is at risk; therefore, there is an urgent need to plan a preventive strategy in relation to health hazards of e-waste handling among these workers in India, added Dr Rao./E-waste, which includes discarded cell phones, computers, printers, and TVs, has been linked to risk factors for cardiovascular disease and possibly cancer. Researchers now say pollutants released from e-waste can have lasting, damaging effects on human health./Despite the Indian government's stringent law to regulate e-waste trade, destitute children still face hazards picking apart old computers, TV etc. The chamber has also strongly advocated the need to bring out effective legislation to prevent entry of child labour into its collection, segregation and distribution./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Ways to protect your kids from pollution,"With the increasing perils of widespread pollution all over the city, it becomes almost impossible to stay safe from its harmful effects./Dangers further increase when you live in a city like Delhi which has recently been given the dubious tag of one of the most polluted cities in the world. There is a huge toll of diseases which the residents have to pay by their regressing health. Children are more prone to air borne diseases and thus tend to have severe health implications than adults because their organs are underdeveloped and weak./Talking about the concern, Dr Rajesh Chawla, Apollo Hospitals said, ""There are many common diseases like recurrent nasal discharge and cough which young school going children are seen to be suffering from. This can often lead to the development of bronchial asthma in the later part of their lives. This also results in gradual loss of concentration and hampers their physical and mental growth."" ""Nevertheless, they can fall in the trap of a variety of severe chronic diseases because of the summer heat coupled with the adverse effects of air pollution,"" he added./Dr. Nitin Verma, a senior pediatrician at Max Hospital said that the affects of air pollution can also be seasonal. ""There are high chances of small children being infected by the viruses of conjunctivitis or typhoid. While in the winters, children can probably have serious breathing problems coupled with cold and cough. Other than this, it also affects their overall growth rate. There has been a 40-45% increase in the number of patients carrying restrictive airway diseases in the past 4 to 5 years.""/So what are the ways you can guard your children:/- Avoid getting caught in long traffic jams and if you do, keep your window panes closed./- Use handkerchiefs and glasses to protect their face and eyes./- Make sure they take a bath or rinse their mouth and change their clothes after returning back from outside./- Apart from this, children should avoid playing in areas that are more exposed to smoke emissions./- Avoid walking on busy roads and inhabiting in densely populated and shabby colonies. They can use masks for protecting themselves from diseases and can also make the use of air purifiers and filters for avoiding indoor pollution./- Take your kids to greener areas for fresh air, preferably early in the morning./- Make your kids practice breathing exercises. They will be doubly beneficial if practiced in a cleaner greener place. If not, practice indoors./-Mehak Dutta/For more stories, follow us onand/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Foul air killing up to 80 Delhiites a day, claims study","Air pollution from respirable particulate matter (PM2.5) could be responsible for 10,000 to 30,000 premature deaths in Delhi - up to 80 deaths each day - authors of an international study released on Tuesday indicated./Scientists who conducted the study, published in the Environmental Science and Technology journal, said most of these deaths were due to heart attacks and strokes, and not very many because of respiratory diseases./The study, Addressing Global Mortality from Ambient PM 2.5, found that more than 45% of these premature deaths in Delhi could be avoided if the city met the national ambient air quality standard for PM2.5. In fact, if the city's air could be cleaned up to the safe standards set by the World Health Organization, as much as 85% these deaths could be avoided, the experts said./Across India, as many as 4 lakh premature deaths per year could be prevented if the WHO standards were met. If no action is taken to bring down the current PM2.5 levels, deaths from air pollution would increase by 20% to 30% in India, the study warned./Scientists arrived at the potential to prevent premature deaths in Delhi assuming that the annual mean PM2.5 level in Delhi was about 150 micrograms per cubic metre, about four times the national standard and 15 times the WHO guideline./The study is authored by Joshua S Apte from the University of Texas, Julian D Marshall from the University of Minnesota, Aaron J Cohen from Health Effects Institute and Michael Brauer from University of British Columbia./It found as many as 2.1 million deaths per year could be prevented globally if air quality met the WHO guideline of 10 micrograms per cubic metre./An earlier study called the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) had estimated that high levels of PM2.5 particles, which can get lodged in the lungs and enter the bloodstream, were responsible for 3.2 million deaths globally. The current study uses a high-resolution global model to estimate how many deaths can be prevented, and in which parts of the world, using data from the GBD as well as following the methods of the GBD study./""The number one killer from air pollution, particularly PM2.5, is not respiratory diseases but ischemic heart disease and strokes,"" co-author Apte told TOI./About 1.4 million premature deaths can be avoided in China and India alone if air quality met the WHO guideline, the study found./Authors of the study said making small reductions in PM2.5 concentrations would not help prevent a majority of deaths. The PM2.5 levels need to be maintained as per WHO guidelines or even lower for best gains. ""If you do a little bit to reduce pollution you don't get anywhere near what you get if you reduce the levels in a major way,"" said Marshall./Interestingly, researchers found mortality rates can be substantially reduced even in places with a lower PM2.5 level, indicating that even low PM2.5 levels can cause mortality. ""We were surprised to find the importance of cleaning the air in not just the dirtiest parts of the world which we expected to find, but even in cleaner environments like US, Canada and Europe,"" added co-author, Marshall./The study found mortality in China due to air pollution as well as annual mean levels to be much higher than India. This, scientists said, was also because ground level air pollution data was much more robust and easily available in China. The estimates for India were conservative due to limited monitoring data./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

If no action is taken to bring down the current PM2.5 levels, deaths from air pollution would increase by 20% to 30% in India, the study warned./Scientists arrived at the potential to prevent premature deaths in Delhi assuming that the annual mean PM2.5 level in Delhi was about 150 micrograms per cubic metre, about four times the national standard and 15 times the WHO guideline./The study is authored by Joshua S Apte from the University of Texas, Julian D Marshall from the University of Minnesota, Aaron J Cohen from Health Effects Institute and Michael Brauer from University of British Columbia./It found as many as 2.1 million deaths per year could be prevented globally if air quality met the WHO guideline of 10 micrograms per cubic metre./An earlier study called the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) had estimated that high levels of PM2.5 particles, which can get lodged in the lungs and enter the bloodstream, were responsible for 3.2 million deaths globally. The current study uses a high-resolution global model to estimate how many deaths can be prevented, and in which parts of the world, using data from the GBD as well as following the methods of the GBD study./""The number one killer from air pollution, particularly PM2.5, is not respiratory diseases but ischemic heart disease and strokes,"" co-author Apte told TOI./About 1.4 million premature deaths can be avoided in China and India alone if air quality met the WHO guideline, the study found./Authors of the study said making small reductions in PM2.5 concentrations would not help prevent a majority of deaths. The PM2.5 levels need to be maintained as per WHO guidelines or even lower for best gains. ""If you do a little bit to reduce pollution you don't get anywhere near what you get if you reduce the levels in a major way,"" said Marshall./Interestingly, researchers found mortality rates can be substantially reduced even in places with a lower PM2.5 level, indicating that even low PM2.5 levels can cause mortality. ""We were surprised to find the importance of cleaning the air in not just the dirtiest parts of the world which we expected to find, but even in cleaner environments like US, Canada and Europe,"" added co-author, Marshall./The study found mortality in China due to air pollution as well as annual mean levels to be much higher than India. This, scientists said, was also because ground level air pollution data was much more robust and easily available in China. The estimates for India were conservative due to limited monitoring data./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"It's not just stench, the foul air is making people sick","""Why should people in Noida pay the price for Delhi's garbage?"" asks C N Parmar, who lives in Sector 15, one of the areas affected by the Shahdara drain. ""People keep falling ill due to respiratory and skin problems in our sector because of toxic gases that the drain emits. Mosquitoes, too, breed in the drain,"" he adds./The drain, which enters Noida from east Delhi before flowing into the Yamuna, is a perennial irritant for residents of the sectors it skirts, an invisible but permanent presence in their lives because of the stench and manifestations on health./A big reason why the drain emits toxins is that the water doesn't always flow smoothly into the Yamuna and turns putrid because of a gradient mismatch. ""Noida's gradient was not taken into account while building the drain. Naturally, the sewage flow is slow,"" says Sushil Agarwal, former president of the Federation of Noida RWAs./Built as a flood-control measure, the Shahdara drain is 2 metres lower than the Yamuna when the river floods, especially during the monsoon months. As a result, water doesn't flow out./A raging debate has been on whether the drain should be covered or left open. Especially considering the amount of solid waste, like plastic bags and household garbage, that is dumped along it. Concerns on lack of cleaning have been a major factor in arguments against covering the drain./Dengue, malaria, asthma, bronchitis and lung problems can be triggered by air pollution caused by toxic gases among people exposed to air around open drains for a long time. Dr A K Shukla, senior consultant at Kailash Hospital, says open drains emit hazardous gases like sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide. ""Inhaling these gases could lead to problems of breathlessness, suffocation, headache and abdominal disorders. This also pose a threat to patients suffering from asthma and bronchitis,"" he said, adding the number of cases of allergy and skin problems from sectors near the Shahdara drain had been increasing over the years./Doctors also say regular and direct exposure to such pollution weakens the immune system. ""High toxin exposure reduces immunity over a period of time. That's how children tend to fall ill frequently, or a patient with low immunity takes longer than usual to heal,"" says Dr A K Agarwal, president (Noida chapter) of the Indian Medical Association./If the drain is not covered, residents need to take preventive measures to keep immunity high. The most effective way to counter the toxins in the air is by planting more trees, suggests Dr Agarwal. ""Surround yourself with greenery. To increase your immunity, expose yourself to morning sunlight and give children lots of citrus fruits and green vegetables,"" he adds./It's not that mitigation measures have not been taken. Delhi has recently set up an effluent treatment plant at the point where the Shahdara drain enters Noida so that untreated sewage does not flow into Noida. But encroachments along the Sahdara drain haven't helped as waste keeps finding its way into it. Neither does the gradient./Amid such serious health concerns, the state government, surprisingly, hasn't yet commissioned a study on the quality of air around the drain. Doing so may help prepare a defence for residents even as they await an institutional response from the Delhi, UP and central governments to find a permanent solution./Atulesh Yadav, regional officer of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board, says, ""Methane and sulphide gases are commonly found in sewers. So obviously, if the sewers are open, such gases escape into the air of the city. We have never studied the city air for these toxins. The levels of these gases would, however, vary from place to place in the city.""/Dr Agarwal suggests that the city air be fogged regularly to kill germs and disease-bearing organisms./The Shahdara drain isn't however, the only one that pollutes the air. The entirety of Noida's sewage - domestic and industrial - has only three outlets, the three arterial drains. Each of them, about 13km in length, flow through various sectors to eventually merge with the UP Irrigation Canal, originally a stormwater canal, and then empty into the Hindon, which merges with the Yamuna. Most of the sewage carried by these drains is untreated./Noida Authority chairman and CEO Rama Raman said Noida cannot do anything about the Shahdara drain since it belongs to Delhi but measures were being taken to clean up other drains. He agreed that open drains are a cause for serious health concern but also promised a clean city to Noida residents soon. ""An effluent treatment plant proposal for the entire city is under process. We are awaiting a no-objection certificate from the Uttar Pradesh irrigation department,"" Raman said./""We also have plans to cover some part of the drains. For this, a team of senior officials will soon leave for Mumbai to study the technique of covering drains with plastic,"" Raman added. ""If viable, we may replicate it here in Noida. We are also studying the feasibility of covering the drains and using the space to create green spaces, use it for parking vehicles or for commercial purposes. We will also put in place measures to stop pollutants like industrial waste, plastic and other harmful contaminants from being emptied into the drains.""/(With inputs from Shafaque Alam and Vandana Keelor)/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Draft emission rules allow new coal plants to pollute,"Dr Hisamuddin Papa/In May 2015, the ministry of environment, forests and climate change pro posed rules to curb air pollution from coal-fired power plants. At first glance, the draft notification may seem like a breath of fresh air. The proposed standards are comparable to stringent international levels for units installed after 2017. But while promising the heaven in the future, it condemns communities like those in Ennore and Kathivakkam, currently living next to power plants to distress. The notification specifies lax emission standards for plants built before 2003 and from 2003 to 2006 but does not specify any standards for plants installed between 2006 and 2017. According to the Central Electricity Authority, nearly 100,000MW of coal-fired plants were set up between 2007 and 2015. In Tamil Nadu, some 6,000MW of coal plants in state, private and joint venture would be operating \xAD a majority already producing power \xAD by the end of 2016. These include new plants in Vallur and Puzhuthivakkam, North of Ennore. Air pollution from these plants are by no means local.Riding the air waves, they settle like a killer blanket over North Chennai, and extend well into the main city as well./Air pollution should not be taken lightly . Earlier this year, the World Health Organisation declared that air pollution had caused 7 million premature deaths in 2012 \xAD twice as many mortalities as TB, malaria and HIV combined. Another cele brated study called the Global Burden of Diseases found that outdoor air pollution was the fifth most significant health risk for Indians, accounting for 627,000 deaths every year.Burning of coal, India's declared fuel of choice for electricity, is a primary contributor to the total air pollution load./Burning of coal releases sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides, Particulate Matter or respirable dust, and heavy metals like mercury , arsenic, lead and cadmium. Sulphur dioxide is a potent lung irritant. Respirable dust, which is invisible, goes deep into the respiratory system and lodges itself in our lungs. In North Chennai, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has recorded Particulate Matter at levels exceeding 300 microgramsm3. Even lax Indian guidelines classify such levels as ""hazardous"" to health./Respirable dust is known to cause strokes, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders, acute lower respiratory infections in children and lung cancer. People suffering from other diseases of the respiratory tract will be worse off under heightened air pollution. India already has the dubious distinction of being home to 20% of the world's TB patients./The Ennore Thermal Power Station is made up of units less than 500 MW and was set up prior to 2003. The proposed notification is lenient on emissions from such old units. They can continue to emit three times the sulphur dioxide and particulate matter when compared to plants in China. For Chennai residents, the promise of stringent standards on newer plants makes little sense.North Chennai cannot take any more new power plants. Regulations should focus on curbing pollutants from existing plants./In China, power plants operating or coming up in certain critically polluted areas are subject to very stringent air quality regulations. Such a stance is in line with scientific knowledge that incremental increases in pollution in already polluted areas can have vastly increased health risks./The draft notification also underestimates the deadliness of mercury. This harmless looking silver liquid metal is present as a trace element in coal. When coal is burned, a majority of mercury is vapourised and released through the smokestack. Mercury quickly condenses and settles on the ground and is washed into waterbodies with every passing rain. Once in the waterbodies, it changes form into methyl mercury \xAD a deadly neurotoxin.Mercury can damage the brain, kidneys and peripheral nervous system, and can cause birth defects./Because it is a persistent poison, stopping all its emissions from the power plant today will still not spare the people and environment exposed to historical emissions. Blood, hair and food samples from Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh -that have more than 9,000 MW of coal-fired plants -were found to be severely contaminated with mercury ./However, the notification's proposed standard for mercury is 10 to 30 times less than US health-based standards. Plants such as the ones in Ennore are not subject to any mercury regulation despite them being surrounded by ecologically sensitive and fisheries-rich waterbodies on the west and the Bay of Bengal to the east./India's environmental policy and regulations do not reflect a health-based understanding. Well-planned development can contribute to national economy; ill-planned development that does not factor in health costs can erode the nation's productivity ./(Dr Hisamuddin Papa is a pulmonologist who has done research on tuberculosis)/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Climate change threatens to reverse years of progress in global health,"MUMBAI: A recent study on threat to human health from climate change, could have special relevance for countries like India which battle with extreme weather patterns./The analysis published in the reputed medical journal Lancet warns that threat to human health from climate change is so great that it could undermine the last 50 years of gains in development and global health./But it also says, there is new evidence showing that because responses to mitigate and adapt to climate change have direct and indirect health benefits - from reducing air pollution to improving diet - concerted global efforts to/tackle climate change actually represent one of the greatest opportunities to improve global health this century./The study shows the direct health impacts of climate change come from the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, especially heat waves, floods, droughts and storms. Indirect impacts come from changes in infectious disease patterns, air pollution, food insecurity and malnutrition, involuntary migration, displacement and conflicts./""Climate Change is a medical emergency,"" says the commission co-Chair Professor Hugh Montgomery, director of the UCL Institute for Human Health and Performance. ""It thus demands an emergency response, using the technologies available right now. Under such circumstances, no doctor would consider a series of annual case discussions and aspirations adequate, yet this is exactly how the global response to climate change is proceeding.""/The potentially catastrophic risk to human health posed by climate change has been underestimated, say the authors, and while technologies and finance required to address the problem can be made available, global political will to implement them is lacking./According to the study's co-chair, Professor Anthony Costello, director University College London Institute for Global Health ""Climate change has the potential to reverse the health gains from economic development that have been made in recent decades - not just through the direct effects on health from a changing and more unstable climate, but through indirect means such as increased migration and reduced social stability. However, our analysis clearly shows that by tackling climate change, we can also benefit health, and tackling climate change if fact represents one of the greatest opportunities to benefit human health for generations to come.""/There are numerous ways in which action on climate change brings immediate health gains - burning fewer fossil fuels reduces respiratory diseases, and active transport (walking and cycling) cut pollution and road traffic accidents, and reduces rates of obesity, diabetes, coronary heart disease and stroke. There are also health benefits from changes to diet which might arise from a concerted effort to tackle climate change, such as eating less red meat./The commission concludes that a strong international consensus is essential to move the world to a global low-carbon economy, harnessing a crucial opportunity to protect human health, particularly of the poorest and most vulnerable populations, who stand to be hardest hit by the effects of climate change./Commission co-Chair Professor Peng Gong from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, says ""The health community has responded to many grave threats to health in the past. It took on entrenched interests such as the tobacco industry, and led the fight against HIV/AIDS. Now is the time for us to lead the way in responding to another great threat to human and environmental health of our generation.""/As a result of the commission's work, the authors propose formation of a new global independent body on climate change and health ('Countdown to 2030: Climate Change and Health Action'). This global coalition will monitor and report every two years on the health impacts of climate change, progress in mitigation policies and their interaction with health, and progress with broader actions to reduce population vulnerability, to build climate resilience, and to implement low carbon, sustainable health systems./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air quality of Allahabad's green belt worsens, health problems on rise","ALLAHABAD: Air quality level in the green belt as well as in busy market areas of Sangam city has decreased to a dangerous level in the Sangam city exposing the citizens to fine dust particles pollutants called Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM)./The surprising fact is that pollutants like soot, dust-powder and dirt in the localities surrounded by lush greenery have been found to have increased to four to five times./As per the data collected by regional office of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), SPM collected from congested market place of Laxmi Talkies Crossing at Katra was registered at 540 microgram per cubic metre which is five times than the permissible limit of 100 microgram per cubic metre. The data collected in the green belt of Ashok Nagar was found to be 487 microgram per cubic metre which is four times than the permissible limit./The Respirable Particulate Matter (RSPM) which represents the level at which a person can breathe too have increased to over five times than the standard limit./Now with the increase in the air pollution, the health hazards of residents have increased to four times due to the air-pollutants./Earlier the data collected from the Katra spots in July 2010 was 271 microgram per metre cube while in April, 2014, it was recorded at 479 microgram per metre cube. Thus latest collected data shows that in past five years, the pollution has increased to over five times./""Another site of posh Ashok Nagar locality situated amidst green tract of land registered RSPM at 233 microgram per cubic metre while the normal is 60. Similarly in Katra areas the RSPM is 263 which is four times more than the normal,"" said SB Franklin, regional officer, UPPCB./Experts say the pollutants recorded after a drizzle is not normal as high pollution level is mostly recorded in the month of January and December only, due to mist, haze and smog./""The latest samples of ambient air-quality in the areas is recorded in the month of May. As per the data the contents of SPM and RSPM have increased manifold,"" added Franklin./Similar is the case of commercial cum residential area of Jhonstonganj area where levels of SPM and RSPM were recorded at 196 and 345 microgram per metre cube. Surprisingly, the area which witnessed heavy vehicular movement and commercial activities had registered less pollutants than that of posh locality of Ashok Nagar. In Rambagh, the SPM was found to be 334 microgram per metre cube while at residential area of Alopibagh, it was found to be 342./As per experts, dust allergy, asthma, lung cancer are the main health problems due to the air pollution due to SPM in the atmosphere./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Visakhapatnam residents voice pollution concerns over HPCL expansion,"VISAKHAPATNAM: A large number of people residing in the neighbourhood of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited's Visakh Refinery (HPCL-VR) have expressed concern over the pollution caused by state-run refinery as well as safety./Participating in the environmental public hearing for expansion and modernisation of HPCL-VR from 8.33 MMTPA (million metric tonne per annum) to 15 MMTPA, residents complained about air and groundwater pollution, which they felt needs to be addressed by the refinery on priority. The expansion and modernisation of the refinery is estimated to cost around Rs 17,000-18,000 crore and is expected to take around four to five years for completion./While a majority of the residents welcomed HPCL-VR's expansion plans, they demanded that the refinery management address issues related to pollution, setting up of a new hospital, providing employment to locals and improving safety standards./Speaking at the public hearing, MLA PGVR Naidu urged HPCL to take up the project of modernising drains running within the refinery premises at a cost of Rs 60 crore so that residents in the neighbouring areas don't have to suffer problems of water logging during the rainy season./CPM leader M Jaggu Naidu said, ""Accidents at HPCL are occurring at frequent intervals. We saw 61 persons die in the blast in 1997 and 28 deaths in the 2013 incident. Various commissions have given recommendations for improving safety standards, but HPCL is doing nothing about safety."" He alleged that people in the neighbourhood areas of Malkapuram, Sriharipuram, Ramakrishnapuram, among others, are facing respiratory problems due to air pollution caused by the refinery./Referring to the accidents at HPCL-VR, resident Lakshman Murthy said, ""Nobody is held responsible for accidents at the refinery."" At the same time, he alleged, ""There is no good groundwater available and people are also facing skin diseases due to pollution.""/""The HPCL management should hold meetings with the public at regular intervals to understand the grievances of the people and take corrective measures. There is nobody from HPCL available if we want to contact them about our problems,"" complained another resident Ganesh Misra./Raising a question on pollution, naval officer Mangal Kakkar said, ""What will be the environmental impact in terms of the increase in traffic, pollution, sulphur emissions, RSPM (Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter) and TSPM (Total Suspended Particulate Matter) due to the expansion?""/Retired defence employee K Ramakrishna Raju said, ""We oppose the expansion of the refinery but welcome the modernisation. HPCL needs to first address the existing pollution problems being faced by residents in its neighbourhood before going ahead with its expansion plans.""/Pointing out that HPCL needs to redesign its chimneys to prevent air pollution, he said, ""Nearly 22,000 employees working in defence establishments are suffering due to pollution."" He also slammed the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) for neglecting the area./Demanding at least 75% employment to locals, Madhu Babu of Malkapuram said, ""The elected representatives from the region should insist on the refinery providing jobs to locals. People are coming from other states and working for lesser wages, but local youth with requisite skills are being denied opportunity. The refinery needs to take this issue into consideration as there is widespread anger against the HPCL management for neglecting local youth.""/Answering questions raised by the joint collector J Nivas, who chaired the environmental public hearing, HPCL-VR officials said that modernisation of the plant will reduce sulphur dioxide emissions and particulate matter in the air will come down to negligible quantities. At the same time, HPCL officials said that while compensation had been paid to the kin of those who perished in the 2013 blast, jobs promised to the kin were still under review. Joint collector J Nivas also directed HPCL to provide medicines to the existing GVMC hospital in the neighbourhood./HPCL officials also informed the joint collector that Rs 1,437 crore would be spent on reducing sulphur emissions from the plant./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"80% of India's surface water may be polluted, report by international body says","NEW DELHI: Even as India is making headlines with its rising air pollution levels, the water in the country may not be any better. An alarming 80% of India's surface water is polluted, a latest assessment by WaterAid, an international organization working for water sanitation and hygiene, shows./The report, based on latest data from the ministry of urban development (2013), census 2011 and Central Pollution Control Board, estimates that 75-80% of water pollution by volume is from domestic sewerage, while untreated sewerage flowing into water bodies including rivers have almost doubled in recent years./This in turn is leading to increasing burden of vector borne diseases, cholera, dysentery, jaundice and diarrhea etc. Water pollution is found to be a major cause for poor nutritional standards and development in children also./Between 1991 and 2008, the latest period for which data is available, flow of untreated sewerage has doubled from around 12,000 million litres per day to 24,000 million litres per day in Class I and II towns./The database defines Class I towns as those with a population of more than 1 lakh, whereas towns with population ranging between 50,000 to 1 lakh are classified as Class II./The report, titled 'Urban WASH: An Assessment on Faecal Sludge Management (FSM) Policies and Programmes at the National and State Level', is likely to be released next week./According to the report, inadequate sanitation facilities, poor septage management and a near absence of sanitation and waste water policy framework are primary reasons responsible for the groundwater and surface water pollution in the country./Experts say there are glaring gaps not just in treatment of sewerage water but also in case of water treatment itself, used in supply of drinking water as well as for kitchen use etc./""Though there are standards, the enforcement is very low. Even the amount of water, which is treated, is also not treated completely or as per standards. And there is no civic agency accountable or punishable for that because we do not have stringent laws,"" says Puneet Srivastava, manager policy- Urban WASH & Climate Change at WaterAid India./Findings of the report show nearly 17 million urban households, accounting for over 20% of total 79 million urban households, lack adequate sanitation./""Among those with access to improved sanitation facilities, a vast majority relies on on-site sanitation systems, such as septic tanks and pit latrines. Today, these septic tanks and pit latrines have become a major contributor to groundwater and surface water pollution in many cities in the country,"" the report said./However, the report acknowledges that India has of late started focusing on the problem of septage management, which is one of the most immediately implementable solutions to address urban waste water./But there is an urgent need to focus on infrastructure as well as enforcement, says Srivastava./""Most of the sewerage treatment plants are performing under their capacity as these utilities do not have enough money to run full capacity,"" says Srivastava pointing at dearth of human resource, improper management etc./Estimates show there were 269 sewage treatment plants across the country, with 211 in Class I cities, 31 in Class II towns, and 27 in other smaller towns./""At the policy level, sanitation was not prioritized until the early 1990s and became an important policy concern only around 2008. It was not until the inception of the National Urban Sanitation Policy (NUSP) in 2008, that urban sanitation was allotted focused attention at the national level,"" the report said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
NMMC missive to MPCB: shut down the polluting units as workers falling sick,"NAVI MUMBAI: In a determined fight to close polluting units at a quarry site in Turbhe, close to the dog center on the landfill site, NMMC has locked horns with the MPCB./The health department has shot off a letter to the regional officer, MPCB on Monday for immediate action.

Deadly deficiencies,"VISAKHAPATNAM: Troubled by nagging knee pain and fatigue for over a fortnight, 45-year-old corporate executive K Siddharth visited a city-based orthopaedic doctor only to find, much to his horror, that osteomalacia (softening of bones) had set in. Subsequent tests revealed that he had been suffering from severe Vitamin-D deficiency over a period of time./The single most important natural source of Vitamin-D generation in the body is sunlight. And it's a paradox that in a round-the-year sunny country like India, over 80% of the urban population suffers from Vitamin-D deficiency in varying degrees./Ongoing medical research in India shows that at the root of several debilitating ailments, from deteriorating bone and muscle health to higher exposure to the risk of heart attack and diabetes, is Vitamin-D deficiency. Believe it or not, more than 50% doctors in the Port City too have been diagnosed with Vitamin-D deficiency. This shocking fact was revealed when tests were done on specialised doctors while they were attending a medical conference in the city a couple of years ago./Vitamin-D deficiency has reached such alarming proportions that the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has now taken up a special national campaign called 'Rise and Shine' from this month to raise awareness about the deficiency and its impact on public health. The drive aims at sensitizing its 2.5 lakh members across 128 cities and 1,500 branches over the next two years about the need to raise awareness about Vitamin-D deficiency. The campaign also aims to provide soft skills training to doctors on essential topics. As part of the campaign, around 100 doctors in the Port City were recently imparted medical education about various health threats faced by the Indian population due to Vitamin-D deficiency./Dr K Venkata Ramprasad, president, IMA Vizag, said, ""Vitamin-D deficiency is rapidly gaining epidemic status. Yet it is the most under-diagnosed and undertreated nutritional deficiency in India and the world. Vitamin-D, which is synthesised in the body by exposure to the sun, is essential to maintain calcium homeostasis in the body for good bone health and overall disease prevention. Supplementation is required when adequate levels are not met from natural sources. We must raise awareness about this, and we must do it now for we are at a higher risk than ever before.""/Elaborating on the causes of widespread Vitamin-D deficiency among the populace, Dr L Loknadharao, associate professor of orthopaedics, Andhra Medical College, said, ""Research conducted in India and papers published in medical journals indicate that Indians are genetically predisposed to the disease even if they maintain a healthy lifestyle. Nowadays the lack of exposure to sunlight has heightened the risk of developing Vitamin-D deficiency, which can be mild, moderate or severe. These days in urban areas most people avoid sunlight by staying indoors, either in AC rooms or cars or offices almost all the time. Even if they go out, they are almost fully covered or apply SPF creams and lotions to guard against UV rays.""/But doctors point out that this sun-shy behaviour is actually doing more harm than good because Vitamin-D is produced in the cells of the body through the absorption of ultraviolet (UV) rays by the skin, which converts molecules into Vitamin-D. ""This vitamin plays a crucial role in helping our body absorb minerals like calcium and phosphorus from the food we eat, which are essential for good bone health. Also, with more melanin present in Indian skin (that imparts it a dark colour), proper absorption of UV rays is in any case affected. Added to this, air pollution and extensive use of sunscreens is now further obstructing ultraviolet rays of the sun from reaching the human body,"" added Dr A Mythili, associate professor of endocrinology, King George Hospital (KGH), and founder-secretary of the Diabetic Child Society./Moreover, contrary to the earlier belief that exposing oneself to early morning sun is best and one should avoid the strong sunrays from 10 am to 4 pm, recent research points to just the opposite. ""For effective Vitamin-D absorption through UV rays, one has to expose at least 40% of the body to sunlight between 10 am and 4 pm. Ideally, daily exposing the face, arms and legs for 10 minutes or 40% of the body for 40 minutes for 40 days a year would help in the production of Vitamin-D,"" said Dr Mythili./""The effective treatment of the deficiency includes consumption of one Vitamin-D supplement tablet every week for eight-weeks. Even when the deficiency gets totally rectified, one supplementary tablet every month should be taken and another blood test should be done to see if the Vitamin-D level is back to normal,"" advised Dr Loknadharao, adding that subjecting everyone to a costly blood test is not warranted but symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, poor growth, joint pains can be indicative of this deficiency./""While Vitamin-D deficiency enhances risks of heart attacks, even cardiac patients, who have undergone angioplasty should take Vitamin-D supplements to prevent future attacks and for a better prognosis besides growing children and elderly people,"" he averred. This deficiency, till rectified, also lowers the efficacy of hypolipidemia drugs or cholesterol medicines./While undoubtedly sunlight is the single most important natural source of Vitamin-D generation, small quantities of Vitamin-D are also present in egg yolk, milk cream and in some fatty fish. Further, in order to protect people from Vitamin-D deficient diseases, the government must consider a national policy on Vitamin-D food fortification by adding it to milk and edible oil, suggested Dr Mythili./Besides Vitamin D, Indians also lack another essential vitamin in their body, Vitamin-B12, especially due to their dietary habits. Experts say that it's mainly the vegetarian population that suffers from diseases associated with this deficiency because animals, rather animal liver, are the main source of this vitamin. The deficiency of both these vital vitamins can be detected through a simple blood test./""Vitamin-B12 deficiency affects both the central and peripheral nervous system causing various nerve malfunctions. However, even non-vegetarians can be affected if they are genetically predisposed. In such patients, Vitamin-B12 absorption from the intestine is hampered due to intrinsic factors and Vitamin-B12 metabolism gets affected. Also many alcoholics and patients under immunosuppressant drugs also suffer from this deficiency,"" said Dr G Butchi Raju, professor and head of the department of neurology at KGH./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Toxic air kills 80 daily in Delhi: Javadekar,"NEW DELHI: Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar said on Thursday air pollution is killing 80 people every day in the capital. In a written reply in Rajya Sabha, Javadekar said respirable particulate matter or PM 2.5 is one of the factors responsible for morbidity and premature deaths./""An recent international study has claimed that foul air is killing up to 80 people a day in Delhi. The number of premature deaths given in the study is based on the constructive estimates and extrapolations of data,"" he said./Last month, TOI had reported the findings of the study published in ""Environmental Science and Technology"" journal, which concluded that 45% of premature deaths linked to air pollution in Delhi could be avoided if the city met the national ambient air quality standard for PM2.5 that is 60 micrograms per cubic metre. In fact, 85% of these deaths could be avoided if the city's air can be cleaned up to the safe standards set by the World Health Organization, which is 10 micrograms per cubic metre, the study revealed./Across India, as many as 4 lakh premature deaths could be prevented every year if the WHO standards are met./The authors of the study extrapolated that PM 2.5, or fine, respirable pollution particles that can get lodged in the lungs or enter the blood stream, could be responsible for 10,000-30,000 premature deaths annually in Delhi - up to 80 deaths each day./The study authored by Joshua S Apte from University of Texas, Julian D Marshall from University of Minnesota, Aaron J Cohen from Health Effects Institute and Michael Brauer from University of British Columbia released a map of India showing places of highest morbidity due to air pollution./Javadekar said the government had sponsored two studies in the national capital, ""Epidemiological study on effects of air pollution on human health in Delhi"" during the period from and ""Study on ambient air quality, respiratory symptoms and lung function of children in Delhi. Commissioned by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the studies were conducted from 2002 to 2005./""The studies indicate cases of pulmonary and systemic immunity, damage to chromosomes and DNA as well as other health impairments are associated with cumulative exposure to high level of particulate pollution. This increases the risk of various diseases, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases,"" Javadekar said./In the study titled ""Epidemiological Study on Effects of Air Pollution on Human Health"" 6005 healthy adults who were residents of Delhi for ten years or more, aged between 21 - 66 years were surveyed and compared with subjects from rural areas of North and South 24 parganas, Hooghly, Nadia, West and East Medinipur in West Bengal. The study which was carried out in November 2002 and August 2005 found lung function was reduced in 40.3% individuals of Delhi compared with 20.1% in the subjects from West Bengal.

"Air quality level drops to 5-yr low, blame it on vehicular pollution","KOLHAPUR: The city once known for its healthy air has seen a steady deterioration of the air quality over the past five years, largely attributed to the vehicular density in the congested areas. Civic officials and environmentalist have called for better traffic management and regular checks of the vehicles plying through the city roads./The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) data shows that the quantity of respiratory suspended particulate matter (RSPM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) has seen a two-fold increase in last five years./The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) states that the concentration of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in air should not exceed 150 microgram per cubic metre and the respiratory suspended particulate matter (RSPM) should not exceed 80 microgram a cubic metre. The SPM comprises dust, dirt, smoke, soot, smoke and liquid droplets in the air. The RSPM mainly consists particles measuring less than ten microns./The air quality measured at Dabholkar Corner and Mahadwar Road, two of the city's busiest spots, reached 465 microgram a cubic metre as against the monthly average of 170 microgram per cubic metre. The RSPM has increased from monthly average of 70 microgram a cubic metre to 150 microgram per cubic metre./Officials attributed the rise in the harmful particulate matter to the steady increase in the number of vehicles on city roads and poor traffic management. The vehicular population of the city has almost doubled in the last five years. Moreover, around 50% of the vehicles are older than 15 years./The National Green Tribunal (NGT) in its orders in April this year had suggested banning of the vehicles older than 10 years, checkbooths at all entry points to check emission standards of the heavy vehicles and overloading of trucks./MPCB sub-regional officer Manish Holkar said, ""Buses and heavy vehicles more than 15 years old are still plying. The transport department should undertake a drive to check the fitness of such vehicles. The increase in air pollution can be attributed to the poor signalling system on the busy roads, which hinders the vehicular flow.""/Officials claimed that the rise in stone crushing, mining activities and the poor quality roads have lead to the increase in SPM levels. ""The roads need to be decongested by undertaking the measures such as acting against illegal roadside parking, increasing width of the major roads, diverting the heavy vehicles through less congested areas and one-ways for rapid movement,"" said an MPCB official./R K Patil, chief of environmental cell of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC), said the city traffic department should plan one-ways along major roads such as Station Road, Mahadwar Road and Bhausingji Road. ""There are limitations in widening roads, however, other measures such as acting against illegal transport and haphazard parking can be undertaken to ensure that cars and buses do not get stuck,"" he said./The KMC officials said the facility to measure ambient air quality at just two places was insufficient and wanted the locations to be increased to get a clear picture of air quality in the city. More than 35,000 litres of fuel is consumed by the vehicles within the city limits./The KMC's Environment Status Report (ESR) for 2014-15 stated that small scale industries also contribute towards the deteriorating air quality. ""The manufacturing units located at Udyam Nagar and Y P Powar Nagar do not follow the air pollution control guidelines. The chimneys are less than 35 feet and units have not installed the mandatory air purifying system. Henceforth, industrial units should not be permitted in the residential or city,"" states the ESR./The National Green Tribunal (NGT) in its orders in April this year while hearing Vardhaman Kaushik versus Union of India over a case pertaining to Delhi has cited three serious causes for pollution. The first being the burning of plastic and other waste from agriculture and horticulture waste in open, secondly resulting from construction and other allied activities emitting heavy dust and lastly and most importantly the pollution resulting from vehicular traffic and industrial emission. The NGT/Environmentalist Uday Gaikwad said, ""The air pollution concerns can be addressed through infrastructural emphasis. Around 1,200-1,400 trucks carrying mined minerals pass through the city heavily contributing to the air pollution. The ring road's bypassing heavy vehicles can help reduce the emission to a large extent.""/BOX: THE AIR WE BREATHE/YearRSPMSPM/201175220/201253110/201363135/201474224/2015114465/(RSPM: Respiratory Suspended Particulate Matter, SPM: Suspended Particulate Matter)/(Maharashtra Pollution Control Board Data for June)/BOX: AIR QUALITY STANDARDS/The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) states that the concentration of suspended particulate matter in air should not exceed 150 microgram per cubic metre and the respiratory suspended particulate matter should not exceed 80 microgram a cubic metre.

"Will PUC tests check PM2.5, NGT asks govt","NEW DELHI: The National Green Tribunal on Monday asked the Centre to respond on whether or not the pollution-under-control (PUC) testing system can be expanded to include various parameters such as PM2.5 (fine, respirable particulate matter) and hydrocarbons. As of now, PUC testing consists only of checking the opacity of emissions from the hartridge smoke unit./NGT also asked the Centre to check if emissions can be tested while vehicles are running. It asked the Delhi government to deliberate on whether there is parking space to accommodate 10,000 buses that are being procured./The tribunal also asked the government how it planned to manage traffic with the new public transport being introduced and so many private vehicles already on the road. It urged the government to consider rationalizing or staggering office timings for its various departments to ensure there is no congestion. NGT has also asked for its response on capping the number of private vehicles and assessing miles covered or age by when a vehicle can be declared unfit for the road./The tribunal was hearing Vardhaman Kaushik's petition against air pollution in Delhi.

TOI green drive: Plant a tree and clean the air,"NEW DELHI: Delhi's alarmingly poor air quality has been making headlines round the world. Scientific reports and testimonies of people have given enough proof of the respiratory and cardiovascular diseases both children and adults have been suffering from. Even stepping out for a morning walk, a cycle ride or a trip to the market can make you sick. Against such a gloomy backdrop, TOI has been introspecting on what can be done while the state government, Centre and judiciary are engaged in debating and driving policies to improve air quality./Perhaps,. This can protect us and the future generations from the adverse effects of air pollution. These trees can also make neighbourhoods less scorching in summer by improving the micro-climate. They will attract a variety of birds, improve biodiversity and restrict desertification in Delhi./With this objective in mind, we are launching a TOI Green Drive with Hero MotoCorp and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on August 4. It aims to plant at least one lakh saplings on August 30 in Tilpat Valley in Maidan Garhi, south Delhi, a part of the Delhi ridge./In the run-up to the big plantation day that is likely to see participation of more than 10,000 people - along with several spiritual organizations - TOI will organize plantation drives at Sanjay Lake in Mayur Vihar, Phase II; Sector 16, Dwarka; district park in Kalkaji (Aastha Kunj); Sidhola village, NH1, G T Road; Vishal Bagh to Ghoga Crossing; Bakoli village, NH1, G T Road; and Sector 28, Rohini. More than 2,000 saplings of Delhi's native species will be planted in each area./Lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung will inaugurate the drive on Tuesday at Sanjay Lake in Mayur Vihar, Phase II. Residents and children from 10 schools will be planting saplings here./Though air pollution can primarily be checked by regulating its sources, such as vehi cles, thermal power plants, burning of waste such as dry leaves or garbage, and dust, sci entists and experts TOI consulted said plantations can have multiple benefits for Delhi's degrading environment./CR Babu, Professor Emeritus, Delhi University, and the brain behind the biodiversity parks in the city, believes apart from reviving several Aravali forest species, the plantation drive can even bring back animals and bird species that disappeared long ago./""Greenery can help in three ways. It can reduce the urban heat island effect which causes air pollution levels to rise. Green belts can stop the wind-blown dust from entering the city or neighbourhoods. It, of course, absorbs carbon dioxide which is a greenhouse gas...there are so many ways plantations can help,"" said Gufran Beig, project director, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR)./Delhi suffers massively from the urban heat island phenomenon - certain urban areas are extremely hot compared to others with less concretization or more green cover. A study by Indian Institute of Technology, for instance, had found several parts of Delhi were sizzling in summer - Connaught Place, Sitaram Bazar and Bhikaji Cama Place, for instance, had recorded a difference of about 8.3 degree Celsius in temperature from their surrounding areas. Ozone, a highly hazardous gas, is known to rise in heat islands because it's created due to chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds and carbon monoxide in the presence of sunlight and high temperature.PM2.5 particles also remain suspended in the heat at these pollution hotspots./A US Forest Service and Davey Institute study on impact of trees on PM2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) found that urban trees and forests are saving an average of one life every year per city. In New York City, trees save an average of eight lives every year by countering particulate pollution. Delhi, often described to be a harsh city because of its extreme and prolonged summer, requires shade. Urban forests can create the much-needed canopy cover and a carbon sink, bring back birds, grow fruits and flowers and bring down the temperature in the area./Environmentalists are excited that the TOI Green Drive will help rejuvenate a part of the Delhi ridge that has become highly degraded over the years.Wedged between Sainik Farms and Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, the 80ha Tilpat Valley is important because of its ability to retain water in several natural deep pits in the area. The catchment has degraded because of the shrinking forest cover here./The TOI Green Drive is supported by BLK Super Specialty Hospital as medical partner, WWF\xADIndia as NGO partner and Times NIE./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Research raises concerns about CNG exhaust gases,"NEW DELHI: Compressed natural gas (CNG) was pitched as a silver bullet for Delhi's air pollution problem, but new research suggests exhaust emissions of CNG vehicles may also be harmful. They may not be as toxic as diesel fumes but, scientists at Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) say, gases produced while burning CNG contain carbon nanoparticles that are suspected to cause cancer./Referring to a study by CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum and University of Alberta (Canada), M O Garg, director general of CSIR, said nanoparticles have lower mass than particles found in diesel smoke but are far more numerous./""This is a result of combustion which causes carbon disintegration. We have to see if the nanoparticles arise from CNG or the lubricant used. All I am trying to say is that CNG technology may have great potential but there is also a negative aspect to nanoparticles,"" Garg told TOI, adding that systematic toxicity studies are needed besides trials to find out whether particulate filters can remove nanoparticles from exhaust gases./The researchers analyzed smoke from a DTC bus, and carried out similar studies on diesel, petrol and hybrid vehicles./But the researchers also point out that technological improvements have enabled other fuels to gradually become cleaner. ""About 15 years ago, when Supreme Court ordered the implementation of CNG, diesel had 500ppm (parts per million) sulphur content. Now there are catalytic convertors and particulate filters (that make diesel engines cleaner),"" said Garg, citing the introduction of unleaded petrol as another example./The advocacy group Embarq studied emissions from buses run on different fuels in Mexico, Brazil and India, and found that CNG buses emit more micro particles. ""The low-sulphur diesel particles were found to be slightly bigger than those from CNG. We also found that overloaded CNG vehicles emit even more micro particles,"" said Amit Bhatt, strategy head, urban transport, Embarq. ""We can say that Euro V and Euro VI diesel is as good as CNG in terms of other pollutants, and superior if you consider particulate emissions,"" Bhatt added./For now, CNG can't be labeled a highly polluting fuel because its particulate emissions are lower than those from diesel. ""For diesel, we measure the weight of particulate emissions because they are measurable in micrograms. But for CNG, their weight cannot be measured as they are ultrafine; only their numbers can be counted,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, head of Centre for Science and Environment's (CSE) Clean Air campaign. She said European countries have started measuring ultrafine particles because they have already addressed the problem of particulate emissions from diesel. India, however, should focus on reducing PM emissions that are the fifth major cause of death now, she added./""The challenge of ultrafine controls will come only after we clean up the particle mass emissions from diesel vehicles through improvements in emissions standards. After the mass is gone, ultrafines remain,"" Anumita said./Even some leading medical researchers TOI spoke to said more evidence is required to draw conclusions about the harmful effects of CNG emissions. ""The fact that carbon nanoparticles are emitted by CNG-run vehicles does not establish their health impact. Evidence available so far shows that extremely fine particles are not responsible for any significant respiratory health issues since they are too light and are exhaled by healthy individuals,"" said Dr Arup Basu, chest specialist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. But, he cautioned, these particles can deposit inside patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Concrete choking trees even two years after NGT order,"NEW DELHI: In April 2013, the National Green Tribunal directed authorities to remove concrete from within 1.25m radius of the base of every tree in the capital. That order has gone largely unimplemented. What's worse, in many places, the agencies have done a shoddy job, further endangering the trees' survival./As a result, despite their great potential to clean the air and improve micro-climate, many trees in Delhi are in a precarious state and many others are dead, having been deprived of essential nutrients./Municipal corporations, NDMC, DDA and PWD were agencies supposed to carry out the deconcretization order. But court-appointed commissioners who inspected various parts of the capital have told TOI that hardly any effort was put into completing the de-concretization project in any zone. Whatever was done was done in patches and haphazardly, often leaving roots exposed or injured and causing danger of toppling./A court commissioner said in 99% of cases cavities weren't filled with fresh soil. ""They have tried to de-concretize a few trees in each area but haven't completed the job. Without fresh soil to hold them, they are obviously vulnerable,"" he said./Three localities--RK Puram, Hauz Khas and Ashok Vihar-were taken up for de-concretization. Only work in RK Puram and Hauz Khas has been partially completed, said commissioners./Prabhakar Rao of Kalpavriksh pointed out that even in places where it appears that the concrete has been removed, only a thin layer has been dug out and filled with fresh soil. If one looks closely, one finds that underneath, it's still concrete./""I think the official responsible for clearing a certain project should be held responsible for the damage done to the trees. Officials can easily ensure the contractor leaves a space of 1m around the tree. I also feel this clause should be inbuilt in the contract,"" Rao said./Deconcretizing is like first aid for trees that cannot be healed completely, said the expert.These trees are prone to all kinds of diseases--their bark starts decaying and they have growths and pests. The fact that there are so many of them in residential areas indicates that many trees here may be dying or are dead already, said Rao./Meanwhile, court commissioners, too, found only the top layer of concrete removed in Ashok Vihar as well as construction waste at the bottom of trees.""I don't think the agencies have managed to protect trees from concrete anywhere except in NDMC areas,"" said Aditya Prasad, who had filed a petition in NGT against the pathetic condition of trees./Trees may also be affected by severe air pollution.

Though we raised these issues before the corporation council, it was never addressed,"" said opposition leader KJ Jacob./But, mayor Tony Chammany said that it has been a turnaround of sorts for Kochi. ""The ranking is a recognition of the efforts taken by the local body in sanitation and waste treatment. Our next priority is to ensure that toilets have been constructed in each housing unit,"" he said./Despite the promise to set up a new solid waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram, the local body has not done anything. There had been discussions on segregating waste at the source, but it has not yielded the desired result. Though the local body's septage treatment plant at Brahmapuram has started operations, it is yet to function at full capacity./The civic body is still unable to overcome the objections raised by residents in the case of the septage treatment plant at Mundamveli in west Kochi. Kerala Water Authority's pipelines pass through city's drainage systems and whenever there is a leak in the pipelines, filthy waste enter drinking water sources and waterborne diseases spread./Suchitwa Mission executive director K Vasuki said the problem was the way in which solid waste management was being handled. ""There is a lack of in-depth knowledge in case of solid waste management. The tendency to produce quick results give rise to ad hoc projects that bypass integrated and comprehensive planning. We need home compost and the corporation should only be collecting dry waste,"" she said, adding proper segregation at source should be a reality./""The civic sense of an average Keralite prevents him from defecating in the open. Chewing of pan and spitting it is uncommon here. We have larger issues that are being ignored. It is certain that they were ignored in the ranking,"" said Jacob./Residents complain that the corporation is reluctant to include them in waste management projects. ""Residents need to be taken into confidence. If the corporation is keen on segregating waste at the source, it would not be possible for them to make it a success without people participation,"" said R Rangadasa Prabhu, president, Ernakulam District Resident's Association Apex Council./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

City fights for right to breathe,"NASHIK: Kick the butt and let people enjoy their right to breathe. The message of the anti-tobacco campaign launched by some city-based social activists from Independence Day is loud and clear - let there be a pollution-free air for children, smoking zones and removal of all 'pan' stalls near schools and colleges./The social activists have appealed to people to sign in an online petition on change.org and send it to the Prime Minister for a smoke-free air./""The right to a cigarette-free air for children is our demand. People can smoke if they want to but what is the fault of the children who have to breathe in the air polluted by the smokers?"" asked Jagbir Singh, the founder of Manav Utthan Manch (MuM), an NGO. ""We request the Prime Minister to increase tax on cigarettes and 'bidis' and use the money to make chambers where people can smoke freely but the air in it should be refined before being released. At present, only some restaurants have smoking zones,"" he added./MuM has been carrying out anti-tobacco campaigns since the past five years and its members are pursuing with government officials to remove tobacco shops in areas outside educational institutes. There were 25-30 stalls near schools that they have already closed. Last year, there were 10 tobacco shops outside educational institutions./Pan stalls near St Philomena's School, Ashoka Universal and Sacred Heart, Guru Gobind Singh School and KTHM College are still doing brisk business in areas less than a 100-m radius away./A Food and Drugs Administration official said maximum shops have been closed down.

"Mumbai: Air you breathe has more SO2, ammonia now than 3 yrs ago","MUMBAI: The city seems to be getting less livable due to consistent year-on-year increase in air pollutants./Data accessed by TOI from the BMC's yet-to-be-released Environment Status Report (ESR) 2014-15 has quantified the increase since 2012-13./Air pollution levels were monitored at three traffic junctions in the city-Worli, Wadala and Andheri. The results indicated that suspended particulate matter (SPM), ammonia and sulphur dioxide (SO2) levels have gone up at varied pace in different localities across the city./The ESR report shows the NO2 level in Worli, for instance, increased from 44 ug/m3 (micrograms per cubic metre of air) in 2013-14 to 45 ug/m3 in 2014-15-above the permissible standard of 40 ug/m3. Then, particulate matter 10 (PM10) at Wadala junction increased from 161 ug/m3 to 194 ug/m3 during the period-way higher than the limit of 60 ug/m3./The report points to an increase in SO2 and ammonia levels at most traffic junctions. PM2.5 and PM10 levels have risen most significantly at Worli./Dr Rakesh Kumar, chief scientist, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri), says there is ""a great need"" to think why pollution levels are rising. ""Increase in congestion has led to a corresponding rise in pollution levels. Earlier, we would discuss how vehicular engines were not being maintained, which added to the pollution. That is not the case today, as a vehicle's shelf life itself is not more than four to five years.""/Kumar blamed the inadequate public transport system for the spike./""This city traditionally preferred public transport but with constant fare hikes, many people see little difference in the cost of using their own vehicles and taking public transport. They have therefore switched over to their personal transport,"" said Kumar./It also states that the air is relatively cleaner during monsoon as pollutants disperse due to turbulence and rain./Sumaira Abdulali, environmentalist and convenor of the NGO Awaaz Foundation, said that Mumbai seems to be becoming a hub for all kinds of respiratory diseases, all thanks to rising pollution. ""Many a times, there is a realization that grave diseases are an outcome of respiratory disorders. It is not just vehicles that lead to a rise in pollution levels but also several other activities in the city, including large-scale construction, inadvertent fires, especially during festivals, frequent use of fire crackers and small-scale industries that release toxic gases,"" said Abdulali./Dr Rohini V Chowgule, director, Indian Institute of Environmental Medicine, said, ""Pollutants like PM and NO2 are harmful to those with heart and lung issues. Besides, people who exercise by running on streets must make sure they don't run near busy traffic junctions, as they may be inhaling pollutants.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Dust pollution envelops twin cities again,"NOIDA: If air pollution levels have taken a turn for the worse in Delhi, it's not likely to be much different in Noida and Greater Noida./TOI visited some construction sites in the twin cities and found uncovered construction material lying around; vehicles were also seen carrying such materials, again uncovered - all of which indicate that most of the directions issued by the National Green Tribunal in April are being flouted at construction sites./In fact, the situation seems to have reverted in the last six months, when the green court had given strict orders to builders, asking them to adhere to the norms announced by Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) and prevent environmental pollution at construction sites. The NGT on April 7 had noted the rising particulates in the air of Delhi and NCR, and ordered all builders in Noida and its adjoining areas that were not following the MoEF norms and standards of construction drafted in 2010, to suspend work until such rules were followed./The order had come as a rider on air pollution caused by old automobiles in response to a case filed by Vardhaman Kaushik against the Union of India regarding the deteriorating air quality in Delhi and its adjoining cities. ""After an initial enthusiasm from builders following the strict order, the dust pollution caused by construction in Noida and Greater Noida was controlled for some time. The monsoon, too, had kept the pollution in check, but now when rains have stopped, the condition seems to have reversed,"" said Vikram Tongad, an environmentalist ./""We need a fresh round of inspection of all sites again to see that the pollution caused by construction sites is under check./The air has to remain clean so that bronchial diseases and asthma-like conditions do not occur in children in dry months as it always does in Noida,"" said Yogesh Nagar, another activist./""There are over 300 ongoing projects in Noida and Greater Noida.

High BP however grew 39.9% for women as against 59% for men./The top risks associated with the deaths of both men and women were high BP, smoking, high body mass index and diabetes./But the greatest cumulative impact on health comes from poor diet. A combination of 14 dietary risk factors contributes to the highest number of deaths worldwide through ailments like ischemic heart disease, stroke and diabetes./In 2013, 21% of total global deaths were attributed to these risks, which include diets low in fruit, whole grains, and vegetables, and diets high in red meat and sugar-sweetened beverages./The risk factors contributed to a total of 30.8 million deaths in 2013, up by one-fifth from 25.1 million deaths in 1990./IHME director Dr Christopher Murray says the mix of leading risk factors contributing to deaths has changed significantly since 1990. Childhood undernutrition and unsafe water sources have dropped off the global top-10 list, while high cholesterol and alcohol use have replaced them as major contributors to poor health./Risks vary greatly for men and women. Smoking is a larger problem for males, ranking as the number-two risk and associated with 4.4 million deaths; for females it's number six and contributes to 1.4 million deaths. Alcohol use is a top 10-risk factor for male deaths, but it's not a leading cause for females./Children also struggle with different risks than adults.

Seed capital to fall in a high emission zone,"VIJAYAWADA: The plan for the state's new capital has been drafted and the state government is keen to construct Amaravati by 2019, but it seems that the core capital area could end up as a high emission zone. Narla Tata Rao Thermal Power Station (NTTPS) is coming up with new 800 MW and 1760 MW boilers whose emissions will directly impact the seed capital./The Praja Energy Audit Cell (PEAC) has learnt that two tall chimneys (height - 180m and 275m) would be commissioned at the NTTPS within the next five years. The seed capital with skyscrapers et al will be built in the same time period. In all likelihood, the fly ash and flue gases will reach the seed capital as it is situated only 5 km away from the chimneys./The aforementioned NGO's convener and retired inspector of boilers A Punna Rao told TOI that the seed capital will fall in the high emission zone. ""The draft plan talks about 50-storey buildings. Assuming that they are 150m tall, fly ash and flue gas from the chimneys of the boilers is sure to cause problems for those staying in the high-rises whenever the wind blows from the north or the north-east,"" he said./Punna Rao informed that the gases emitted will have particulate matter of size less than 10 microns and these may lead to cancer, heart diseases, brain damage, mental retardation and even premature deaths./According to a study conducted by Union of Concerned Scientists (a non-profit science advocacy organization based in the United States), a 500 MW thermal power plant releases 10,000 tonne sulphur dioxide, 500 tonne airborne particulate matter, 72 kg mercury, 100 kg arsenic and 50 kg lead every year./Activists of PEAC expressed concern that considering the total capacity of NTTPS is 2560 MW, the pollutants will be even more./The PEAC convener pointed out that the carbon dioxide emission from the plant will be 1.8 crore tonne and that of fly ash around 34 lakh tonne per year. ""Such a high level of emissions is mindboggling and I wonder how the capital was mooted here in the first place. Given the fact that a standard 1000 MW thermal power plant contributes directly to the death of 362 people through air pollution and 39 people owing to climate change every year, we are looking at the possibility of living in a capital where deaths of 1024 people per year are assured, courtesy NTTPS,"" he rued./The plant should be shut down or the seed capital shifted a minimum of 30 km away from the plant to ensure that fly ash and deadly gases don't spill over, Punna Rao emphasised./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

'Make clean cooking part of eco drive',"NEW DELHI: India has more than one million premature deaths per year from smoke from chullahs.

Beyond its current work, the government should also incorporate clean cooking as part of its agenda in tackling public health.""/Asked for her opinion on India's declaration of its commitment to cut carbon intensity, Muthiah said, ""India plays a critical role in global climate talks. Its commitment in Berlin is a bold signal leading up to the negotiations in Paris this December, where global leaders will seek to finalize an international framework for climate action with the goal of significantly-reducing fossil fuel emissions.""/India must engage in the renewable energy sector, she said, adding that one of the ways this can be accomplished is through greater access to cleaner, more efficient cookstoves and fuels. With millions of people using chullahs, including the nearly two-thirds of the Indian population who cook with solid fuels, massive amounts of short-lived climate pollutants, including CO2, are being released. The resulting pollution is causing significant damage to human health and environment. Greater use of renewable energy and cleaner fuels will significantly reduce these harmful emissions./""India has the will and the capacity to tackle this issue and save countless lives in the process. The Alliance and its close to 200 partners in India are working to support the government in its development objectives. We're partnering in areas that are creating jobs, eradicating poverty and improving public health, as well as supporting local enterprises to grow,"" Muthiah said./On the Alliance's India plans, the UN official said, ""India has already built a strong momentum both at the state and central levels. Many NGOs are working to educate people and change behaviors so they can make clean cooking a reality. Our role will be to continue to support these ongoing efforts, while encouraging growth in the private sector.""/As for its global vision, it aims to save and improve lives by creating a global market to enable 100 million households to adopt clean and efficient cookstoves and fuels by 2020./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Camp for babus to raise respiratory health awareness,"GURGAON: With Diwali just days away, a group of pulmonologists has scheduled a free camp for senior government officers to conduct lung function tests on them and make them aware of the importance of respiratory health. The camp is scheduled on October 30./The camp was planned after a group of doctors got in touch with deputy commissioner T L Satyaprakash. ""Diwali is near and the day witnesses a major increase in levels of air pollution,"" said Dr Himanshu Garg, a city-based pulmonologist./""Organising a respiratory health camp for bureaucrats is, therefore, an ideal way to take up the issue of pollution because if bureaucrats are sensitised, it could lead to some changes in policies. It will also bring focus on the violation of construction norms laid down by NGT,"" said a doctor, requesting anonymity./Garg, who has been studying air pollution levels in the city for sometime, added, ""Pollution caused by construction can have a fatal impact on the environment as it increases the level of PM2.5 particles (particulate matter less than a 2.5 microns in diameter), PM 10, sulfur dioxide and metal dust in the air. The particles accumulate in the lungs and reduce their oxygen holding capacities, which may lead to lung cancer, bronchitis, sinusitis, asthma, fibrosis, silicosis etc. All these are non-curable diseases.""/""People generally ignore their respiratory health. When the doctors approached the district administration for the campaign, we invited more than 100 officials to attend the camp,"" said Satyaprakash./""As the temperature will drop in the next one month, there will be an increase in the inflow of asthma and bronchitis cases. The body's resistance is quite low during winter so people are easily attacked by viruses.

Garbage disposal system in a mess in Bijnor,"Bijnor: At a time when the Narendra Modi government at the Centre is pitching for cleanliness under the Swachh Bharat mission, the Bijnor city administration is neglecting garbage management under its jurisdiction. Though the civic body collects 25 metric tonnes of garbage a day, it has no landfill site to dump the waste, nor is there any system for recycling of waste./As there is no proper system of waste disposal, the citizens dump garbage on roadsides, making the city an eyesore. Most of the time, the waste is burned, causing air pollution. Bijnor has no air quality monitoring system and no step has been taken by the nagar palika to check unscientific disposal of waste./Ashok Madhup, a resident of Kunwar Bal Govind, said, ""It is a common sight to see residents and shopkeepers burning waste, that includes plastic, every morning.""/Palika executive officer J K Anand denied that civic body employees burn garbage, but he accepted that some residents do set on fire garbage generated by them. Anand said, ""The nagar palika has no land of its own to dump garbage, but we have leased a piece of land where waste is dumped. There are 35 big dustbins placed across the city.""/Pollution control board officer Ashok Tiwari said, ""The city administration has not submitted the annual pollution report so far."" He said the responsibility of recycling of garbage is with the nagar palika. ""We have issued a notice to the nagar palika about this matter.""/According to C P Singh, a chemistry professor who has done extensive research in organic chemistry, ""Plastic takes about 100 to 1,000 years to degrade when used in landfills; and it pollutes both air and water. Burning of plastic containing organochlorine-based substance like PVC releases harmful dioxin, a group of highly toxic chemicals. Dioxin is carcinogenic and a hormone disruptor.""/Head of department at chemistry division in St Mary's College, Bijnor, Mayank Malik said, ""Burning of polystyrene polymers such as foam cups, meat trays, egg containers, yogurt and daily containers release styrene gas, which can be readily absorbed through skin. Long-term exposure to styrene can effect the central nervous system, cause fatigue and depression. At high levels, styrene vapour can damage the eyes and mucous membranes, while dioxin accumulates in our body fat that can be passed on by pregnant women to their babies via the placenta./Talking about the harm these gases cause to babies, Dr Nagraj, child specialist, Bijnor, said, ""Backyard-burning of waste is far more harmful to our health. It can increase the risk of heart diseases, aggravate respiratory ailments such as asthma and emphysema, and cause rashes, nausea or headaches. It can also damage the nervous system, kidney or liver.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

""Well, I wouldn't say these are completely noiseless, but noise-less,"" laughs Abdulla Ghia of a fireworks store at Mohammed Ali Road.""Earlier, the big draw were atom bombs, but now people want more aerial items like the rocket, flashlights and fountains."" There is a `crackling peacock' that actually seems to spread its wings when lit up, a musical ground chakri and one shaped like a swastika! Made of recycled paper, most of the eco-friendly firecrackers have a lesser chemical content and thus emit lesser pollution and noise. Take the long `magic whip' -coloured strings that just throw small sparks and don't emit smoke. ""Most people no longer like that loud dhamaka, and ground atom bombs are no longer appreciated,"" adds Murtaza Sabuwala of a fireworks shop ahead on the same road. "" A new cracker, which is meant to look like railway signal, emits a red then green light just like a real signal. Also popular are `diamonds', which just emit light and are safe for kids,"" he informs./Bikes and kids' fiction characters/The crackers come packaged in everything from the Hulk to Pokemon and designer motorcycles and cars. A Doraemon firework goes hissing into the sky only to fall back within minutes and there are assorted flat cracker cartoons that simply whoosh about two or three feet, minus any smoke.""Another big attraction this time is the Angry Birds cracker, which is just a 5colour assorted fountain with a small crackling sound,"" says seller Himanshu Mehta. He adds that the Christmas tree, which throws out silver lights like flakes and Harry Potter pencils that light up like real wands, have been selling like hotcakes./Shopkeepers welcome sc refusal on cracker ban/Meanwhile, the Supreme Court's recent refusal to order a blanket ban on firecrackers during Diwali, has been welcomed by Mumbai vendors. Says Minhesh Mehta, hon. gen secretary of the Fireworks Dealers Welfare Association, ""It's a good thing that this has happened. After all, the pollution in the city is not only due to crackers, there is so much noise and air pollution due to traffic and that too, 12 months of the year! I feel we can't ban crackers as it is a fundamental right of a citizen to enjoy him or herself, but that said, people also should burn crackers with some self-discipline and not beyond certain hours or in silence zones.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"Farmers burn paddy, city chokes","GURGAON: Constant haze and smog, which has engulfed the city over the last 10-12 days, has led to a sharp deteroration in the city's air quality. According to the continuous ambient air quality monitoring report prepared by Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), levels of PM10 and PM2.5 have increased. While on an average this month, PM10 has risen by 15 micrograms per cubic metre (\xB5g/m3), PM2.5 has gone up by 10 \xB5g/m3./The daily permissible limit for PM10 is 100 \xB5g/m3 and for PM2.5 is 60 \xB5g/m3. This month though, PM10 touched 190.24 \xB5g/m3, while PM2.5 touched 84.04 \xB5g/m3./During this time of the year, burning of paddy stubbles is a regular feature across neighbouring south Haryana districts of Sohna and Farrukhnagar. ""Due to shortage of water, not many districts in south Haryana have paddy fields. But there are a good number in Sohna and Farrukhnagar. Burning of rice hay after harvest in October invariably results in a lot of haze and smog. Gurgaon's proximity causes its air quality to deteriorate,"" said Sudha Yadav, former agriculture research scientist at Pusa./Doctors say every year they notice an increase in the number of asthma and bronchitis cases in this season. ""Burning paddy stubbles causes severe air pollution. The emissions can cause respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function. Paddy-burning releases CO, N2O, NO2, SO2, CH4, along with particulate matter and hydrocarbons that are a health risks,"" said Dr Pratibha, consultant pulmonologist at Artemis Hospital. She also expressed concern over the deterioration of air quality during Diwali due to bursting of crackers./HSPCB officials, though, don't blame paddy burning alone for the fall in air quality this time every year. ""Usually, the area affected is not more than 4-5 sq km. Drop in temperature due to change of seasons is the main culprit behind the haze and smog in the city, as the 'mixing height' (height at which pollutants mix with air) is lowered, and pollutants remain hovering in the lower reaches of the atmosphere,"" said a HSPCB official./Farmers blame authorities for not having any mechanism to collect paddy stalks after harvest. ""We're forced to dispose it ourselves. But we can't sow the winter wheat crop after November 15, as weather conditions are not appropriate. If the authorities are so concerned about pollution, they should collect the waste from us,"" said a farmer in Farrukhnagar, requesting anonymity. Niranjan Raje, a member of the expert appraisal committee of the ministry of environment and forests and a member of Environment Pollution (prevention and control) Authority (EPCA), has a viable solution. He says, ""Rice stalk should be seen as a resource. In 2012, when dark clouds engulfed Delhi/NCR, EPCA called a meeting of Haryana and Punjab governments to propose an alternative. Rice stalk can be collected and used to generate power or manufacture synthetic fuel. Alternatively, a machine to bury the waste into soil in a day can be employed. It will fertilise the soil and prevent air pollution caused by its burning.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

An ever-increasing vehicular population and a large number of trucks criss-crossing the city are the perennial culprits choking the residents. Several other factors including the burning of paddy by farmers in Punjab - combined with smog, have also further degraded the quality of air./Smoke, dust, particulate matters (both PM2.5 and PM10), sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide combine to make a deadly cocktail of poison - one that poses a serious threat to the residents of NCR. In fact, several studies have repeatedly shown that the air quality of the NCR region is among the absolute worst in the world./So does that mean Delhi and the satellite cities around it are indeed becoming unlivable?/An overwhelming 5291 of 5913 respondents (89.41%) to a TOI poll question agreed that the capital of the country is becoming unlivable due to its toxic air. Only 419 respondents disagreed to the question - Has Delhi-NCR become unlivable due to pollution?/Response to the poll on social media went on similar lines with 1143 off 1341 netizens (85.23%) raising their concerns about the deteoriating air quality./AIR ALARM:/* India has 13 of world's 20 most polluted cities./* According to World Health Organisation, Delhi is the most polluted city in the world./* On an average, Delhi air has 153 micrograms of PS2.5s per cubic metre. The international ""safe"" level is 6 micrograms./* Delhi adds approximately 1400 new vehicles on its roads everyday, in addition to almost eight million already./Even as residents are forced to subject themselves to the polluted air, MCD toll operators decided to give a free run to toxic trucks despite Supreme Court's order of collecting pollution tax from heavy vehicles entering the city from November 1./Efforts are few.

"Centre writes to four states, asking them to take stringent measures to prevent stubble burning","NEW DELHI: Perturbed over rising air pollution in Delhi and the national capital region (NCR) due to burning of stubbles by farmers in neighbouring states, the Union environment ministry has written to four states - Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Rajasthan - asking them to take ""stringent measures including punitive action"" to stop burning of crop residue and biomass./""I request you to launch an intense monitoring in your state including through satellite based remote sensing technologies to monitor crop residue management"", said the Union environment secretary Ashok Lavasa in his letters to chief secretaries of the four states./Referring to instances of stubble burning in massive scale, Lavasa said, ""I also urge you to take stringent measures including punitive action to prevent and control burning of crop residue and biomass in agricultural fields and apprise the ministry of the action taken in this regard""./The TOI on Monday flagged the seriousness of the issue where uncontrolled burning of paddy stubbles deteriorated the air quality. The newspaper reported that Delhi's air quality index has dramatically dropped by 60-80 points since Saturday and is now inching towards the 'very poor' zone, when children are advised not to spend time outdoors./Weather condition too has, however, played a role in the appearance of smog./A satellite image from NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) website on Saturday showed 'fire spots', which denote blazes on the ground, all across Punjab and parts of northern Haryana. Haze can be seen enveloping a large region of northern India, including NCR./Even the environment secretary in his note to chief secretaries has also referred to the satellite image that showed hundreds of fire spots across Punjab and parts of Haryana./The ministry had earlier written to all these states twice in the past - first on October 2 last year and second time on September 15 this year - requesting them for compliance to the advisory issued for curbing open burning of crop residue and biomass in fields and to the 'National Policy for Management of Crop Residue - 2014' which emphasised on adoption of technical measures including diversified use of crop residue, capacity building and training./Referring to these two earlier letters, Lavasa in his note to chief secretaries said,""It appears that both the advisories as well as measures contained in the said policy have not been implemented which is leading to occurrence of smog in the NCR region""./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Practical steps for a safe Diwali in the city,"Diwali is known to be the festival of lights, however the festival is only getting noisier by the year./This time around as well, city dwellers are making an attempt to reduce noise and air pollution by doing their bit. Here's how people are promoting a pollution-free Diwali./Housing society/The bombardment of fire crackers at residential areas is leaving senior citizens and children feeling irritable. To make sure this Diwali is a joyous one, certain housing societies have set a limit on the purchase of crackers so that nobody overspends. Says city resident Ritu Mittal, ""Celebrations cannot be put to a halt but mellowing them down is a good approach to curb this issue. We have informed the residents about the safe spots where they can burst crackers; this will reduce the noise and smoke near buildings and ensure the health and well-being of those elderly and sick. Pets are also majorly affected during Diwali and we are taking enough measures that it does not happen this year.""/School initiative/A lot of schools have been promoting a cracker-free Diwali through seminars. An education institute in Nerul organised a puppet show, where the students were made aware of how to have a safe Diwali. ""We educated our students about the harmful effects crackers have on people. The puppets helped in grabbing their attention,"" said a teacher from the school. While students of a Thane-based school performed a street play to create awareness among people and promote their concept 'Care and Share Diwali'. ""With this, we are trying to spread the message of caring for the environment and sharing with the under privileged. Only then can the festival be righteously termed as Happy Diwali,"" said Rajani Pattabhiraman, the principal./Bring back memories/Some city stores have introduced paper patakhas to avoid polluting the environment. An idea from the decades past, origami paper patakhas use a paper folded such that it creates sound similar to a fire cracker. It gives the thrill of crackers and is almost as fun as the real one. Hence, parents need not worry about their child suffering burns or injuries./Safe for animals/Stray animals suffer maximum physical and mental torture during Diwali. ""In spite of knowing that animals fear crackers, people play pranks on them. You see many dogs running with burnt tails and wounds by the end of the festival, because miscreants tie crackers to their tails,"" says animal lover Argho Bhattacharya. ""This year, we will be putting collars on them bearing telephone numbers to track lost and injured animals."" Dr Madhurita Gupta, chief veterinarian at an animal hospital says, ""We are creating awareness among the masses to help injured animals or least call for help. As a precautionary measure, one should avoid bursting crackers in places with high animal population. ""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Drizzle cleans air, but haze havoc ahead","NEW DELHI: The city's air quality improved marginally on Thursday. Though the level of fine, respirable particles (PM 2.5) has moved from the 'severe' category, it continued to be in the ""very poor"" range. The data for Wednesday night and the early hours of Thursday showed alarmingly high PM 2.5 levels./Delhi Pollution Control Committee's real-time air quality graphs showed PM 2.5 levels peaking up to 450 micrograms per cubic metres. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) under the ministry of earth sciences also recorded severe pollution levels at night. ""It was severe from 3am to 8am. Due to the drizzle in the morning, the pollution level became relatively better but still remained in the 'very poor' category. This rain has further introduced some moisture in the air, which is likely to hold several tiny particles after the sunset and air quality may deteriorate further,"" said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR./Meanwhile, experts said reaction has been slow to the air pollution episodes, which means Delhiites are unlikely to get any respite this winter as well. ""The Delhi government has to react to episodes for short term as well as long term. The pollution due to crop stubble burning and Diwali are phenomena that you can plan for way in advance. We also need a smog alert. The government should take action against visibly polluting vehicles and clamp down on illegal parking,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of clean air campaign, Centre for Science and Environment./The Delhi government will take at least 10 days to finalize billboards. The terms of reference is being discussed with a private firm that will instal the boards at 20 locations in the first phase. There will be no health advisory for high pollution days. ""We can only give the real time-data for now,"" an environment ministry official said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
