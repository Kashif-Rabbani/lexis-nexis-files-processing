Smog shoots up respiratory cases,"Diwali is still a week away but people with respiratory problems are already in distress due to smoggy weather and the rising level of particulate matter in the air./Hospitals say their OPDs are flooded with patients suffering from asthma, chronic bronchitis, wheezing and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Healthy individuals, too, are complaining about breathing difficulty , say doctors.Elderly and infants are the worst affected. ""There is a 2030% increase in the number of patients seeking consultation for respiratory distress. Many of them also require admission because they have breathing difficulty and lower respiratory tract infection,"" said Dr Arup Kumar Basu, head of the department of chest medicine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. He said the situation is likely to worsen further during Diwali when the burning of firecrackers will deteriorate the air quality./Basu added that apart from open burning of crops in neighbouring states, pollution due to vehicular emission has also gone up in Delhi. ""There are always heavy traffic jams in the run-up to Diwali. All main roads, bylanes in colonies and markets are crowded with vehicles.Vehicles are also a major contributor to pollution in the city,"" he said./According to Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director of Apollo Hospitals, Delhi witnessed a similar situation in the 1990s when people used to go on short vacation to the hills to avoid increased pollution levels during Diwali. ""The situation had improved a decade later due to intensive awareness campaigns and the introduction of CNG for public transport vehicles. But all the gains made by those efforts seem to have been lost in the past few years. There is a need to adopt a new strategy and take up campaigns to tackle the rising air pollution in Delhi,"" he said./Headaches, mood swings and depression are other health problems that are caused due to high levels of pollution and a dip in the temperature./Roopabh Sharma, a Green Park resident who has been suffering from asthma for many years, said he is not able to breathe properly due to smog. ""The air is filled with pollutants and it causes a lot of breathing difficulty. I prefer to stay indoors mostly ,"" he said./Dr Sujeet Jha, an endocrinologist at Max Hospital, Saket, said the time is not far when people, particularly the children, will be forced to wear masks while going out during peaks hours. ""There is no other way to prevent respiratory distress caused by pollution. Many schools in the US ask children to wear masks if they are vulnerable to respiratory distress due to high levels of pollution,"" he said./Cardiologist Dr Ashok Seth said the risk of heart attack due to constriction of blood vessels and less oxygenation in blood increases in winters, particularly when there is smog. ""The patients are advised to take regular medications and limit outdoor activities,"" he said./For more stories, follow us onand/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Green Diwali campaign on top gear,"COIMBATORE: Environmentalists in the city are batting for an eco-friendly Diwali this year. Several of them have begun running campaigns to spread awareness on the need to abstain from bursting crackers, which cause both noise and air pollution./They said it was more important for people, who have pets at their houses, and also those who live along forest fringes and water tanks, to avoid bursting crackers, as it will scare the animals in the vicinity./The district's location at the foothills of the breathtaking Western Ghats and its plenty of water bodies, they said, has its pros and cons. While the good climate, opportunities to sight exotic birds, extensive greenery on the suburbs and clean air are an advantage, the constant man-animal conflicts are considered a disadvantage. ""However, it is important for people to realize where they live and protect the natural habitat and ecosystem as much as possible,"" said environmentalist Umesh Marudachalam./The environmentalist, who is a part of 'Save Coimbatore Wetlands' campaign, has been appealing to people, who own farmhouses and living along forest fringes, to abstain from bursting crackers. ""I have been communicating to these people through SMSes and social networks. This is besides going from farm-to-farm whenever I visit villages as part of animal conservation work,"" Umesh Marudachalam said./""If it does not rain during Diwali, the forests will become dry and the risk of a forest fire is very high if people were to burst crackers,"" he cautioned. ""Near the wetlands too, the noise scares away birds, for whom this is the nesting time,"" he further said./Tree Trust, another NGO in the city run by environmentalists Mohan Raj and M Yoganathan, has been visiting various government and private schools to create awareness among children on harmful effects of bursting crackers. They also told them how it affects animals. ""It scares away animals like elephants, wild boars and leopards, forcing them to venture deeper into the forest,"" said Raj./""This forces animals to always remain on alert and bunk hunting. Many mammals even leave their young ones and run away. As a result, often a few of hatchlings starve to death. The excess smoke generated also disturbs the animals,"" he added./For his part, Yoganathan has been encouraging children to take an oath that they would not burst crackers this Diwali. ""They have now begun asking their parents not to buy crackers,"" he said. ""We have also asked people, who live near hospitals, not to burst crackers keeping in mind the patients there, who might get disturbed,"" Yoganathan added./The environmentalists hope that many villages in and around the district would follow in the footsteps of farmers and residents of Vellode, the home to the city's closest bird sanctuary, who have not burst crackers in their area for more than a decade, so as not to scare away the birds. The farmers there said the stools and droppings of the birds were very important manure./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
CPCB control room to check air quality,"NEW DELHI: In the backdrop of deteriorating air quality due to meteorological reasons and stubble burning, the Union environment ministry on Friday decided to set up a control room at the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to constantly monitor air quality and day-to-day actions of state agencies to control pollution in Delhi and NCR./Besides, it also took a decision to issue notices to states' pollution control boards under Section 18 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 to hold the local agencies accountable for not taking desired actions against air pollution within their respective jurisdictions./These decisions were taken in a review meeting of measures initiated aken by Delhi and NCR states -- Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh -- to combat air pollution in the past three months. The last such meeting was held in August./Noting that the recent 15-day long smog in Singapore should serve as a warning to all cities including Delhi, environment minister Prakash Javadekar, who chaired the review meeting, attributed the foul air in the city to burning of crop residue in neighbouring states. The situation, he said, will worsen with the advent of winter. ""The Singapore haze problem has given a warning to all cities to become more serious,"" Javadekar said./""To create accountability, we have decided to issue directions under Section 18 of Air Act. This will strengthen the hands of all agencies involved and will also give a legal force to them,"" said Javadekar./Appealing to citizens, especially children, to ""say no to firecrackers"" this Diwali, he said, ""I am convinced that children are the best ambassadors. When they say no to firecrackers, there will be no firecrackers. Already there is a decrease in it.""/During the meeting various measures were suggested to reduce and eliminate stubble burning, including viable alternatives to discourage it, imposing a ban and providing subsidies on bail machines./The minister said a group has been started on WhatsApp through which citizens can send messages and alert authorities whenever they find stubble or solid wastes being burnt. Javadekar said he had called up Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal who has assured him that they are taking serious action such issues./During the meeting, representatives of the Punjab government said the state has started an awareness programme to educate farmers on the ill-effects of burning paddy stubble and biomass. The Rajasthan government had already banned stubble burning sein the state through a notification issued in August this year./In Punjab, mechanised road cleaning has been started in Mohali and will soon be expanded to include other cities. The Rajasthan government has increased the number of PUC checkpoints from 475 to 800./In Delhi, Javadekar said, Pollution Under Control norms were being strictly enforced. ""One lakh vehicles were checked recently out of which 70,000 vehicles were found to have valid PUCs. The number of PUC checking points has also been increased,"" he said./""All agencies are doing their bit. We have asked them to do more on all aspects of checking stubble and biomass burning, addressing construction and demolition waste rules, PUC linked with server, mechanized road cleaning, lane discipline and waste management,"" Javadekar said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Smoke from burnt waste hits walkers,"NAVI MUMBAI: For a civic body that claims to be pro-environment, it has come as a surprise for the residents living next to Wonders Park in Nerul that disposal method of green waste is far from eco-friendly./On Saturday, residents and morning walkers encountered a huge mass of smoke billowing out from the compost pit situated inside the theme park/""The garden staff seem to have burnt the green waste without giving a thought to air pollution. Smoke kept coming out of the pit till late afternoon,"" said a morning walker Shireen Ketkar./However, garden department officials insisted there is a proper system in place to dispose green waste. ""The policy is to prepare fertilizers out of the green waste. Bigger gardens like Wonders Park have compost pits where waste is dumped and transformed to fertilizer,"" said the official./Executive engineer Sanjay Desai said, ""Green waste should not have been disposed in this manner, as there is a compost pit in the park. But I will look into it,"" he said./The 25-acre theme park was constructed at the cost of Rs 37 crore. An average of 50 kg green waste is collected daily from the garden./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Asthma patients must watch out,"Mumbai: The slight nip in the air has led to an increase in the number of patients, both young and old, visiting the doctor's clinic. Patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have to be extra careful, especially with the start of Diwali, said doctors./The increase in air pollution levels due to lighting of firecrackers could, said doctors, worsen the health of children with wheezing problems and the elderly with breathing difficulties. ""People should avoid crackers that emit more smoke than light,"" said chest specialist Dr Sujeet Rajan, who consults at Bombay Hospital, New Marine Lines./A senior doctor said the end of October is usually the time for viral infections. ""People get affected by viruses that trigger colds, coughs and even wheezing,"" the doctor said./Paediatrician Dr Indu Khosla who practises in Andheri said it is difficult to establish whether children are getting breathing problems due to viral infections or air pollution. ""But many children have started coming to the out-patients department with exacerbations. In fact, I admitted two children with exacerbations today,"" said Dr Khosla, adding that such a rise in number of patients is normal around Diwali./She, though, added children who are under medication for asthma should be kept away from smoke from crackers as well as tobacco. ""New research suggests that if such a child comes in contact with second-hand cigarette smoke, his or her medicines won't be as effective."" Dr Rajan said all age groups are affected by air pollution but the young and the old are the most susceptible. He said the elderly should be advised to take vaccines against flu because it makes them susceptible to lung infections./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Post Diwali, air quality will deteriorate, hit health","Mumbai: Mumbaikars can expect a spike in air pollution the day after Diwali./System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) has predicted that the city's air quality index would deteriorate from 259 on Wednesday to 282 on Thursday. Air quality is measured by the level of the main pollutant -particulate material 2.5 (PM 2.5, particles that measure less than 2.5 microns). Air quality values between 201 and 300 are considered poor and people with heart or lung diseases, older adults and children are at risk./""There is a temperature variation due to which pollutants may get trapped in the air. So, we will see air quality deteriorate on the night of Diwali and the following day. Apart from regular pollutants, crackers will add a lot of emissions,"" said Neha Parkhi, senor programme officer, SAFAR, and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune./""People with existing heart or lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart disease, or ischemic heart disease are at an increased risk of admission to hospitals or even premature death based on the severity of already existing problems,"" said the SAFAR report./SAFAR calculates the air quality index (AQI) at various locations in city jointly with IITM, India Meteorological Department and National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting and local corporations./Experts, though, say Mumbai has an advantage considering it is a coastal city. ""In places where wind speed is low, dilution is slower./This is more troublesome in land-locked areas. In Mumbai, due to coastal winds, air quality is bad for a limited period. It begins to normalalize soon,"" said Rakesh Kumar, director, NEERI./""We have been observing that cracker usage is reducing over the past five years. It could be due to both awareness or the rising prices,"" he added./The forecast has also identified Chembur, Bhandup, Mazgaon and Nerul as high risk locations. On the other hand, air in Borivli and Colaba will be relatively cleaner./Meanwhile, even as most crackers this year have met permissible noise levels in a test done earlier this month, activists are unsure if it will be a quieter Diwali since there is no dedicated task force to tackle complaints./""The 10pm deadline for crackers may not be followed if people have to depend on the control room and the local police station to complain about crackers. It is very difficult to get through the control room,"" said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
City pollution leaving many in 30s with 50-yr-old's lungs,"Mumbai: Young Mumbaikars are so badly hit by rising pollution levels that they have weak lungs, says a new study./The study, presented at the recent national conference of chest specialists in Jaipur, tested lungs - the capacity and speed of breathing in oxygen and breathing out carbon dioxide - of the medical staff of a hospital in the western suburbs. Most were aged below 50. Almost 40% of the 87 individuals examined, who had never smoked, had lower-than-ideal lung function or weak lungs./""Some 30-year-olds who were studied had the lung function of a 50-year-old or older,"" said chest specialist Dr Sanjeev Mehta who conducted the study at Arogya Nidhi Hospital, Juhu. ""Imagine their plight when they turn 60?""/Another study conducted in May by HEAL Foundation found a third of 3,000 schoolchildren tested across Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Kolkata had reduced lung capacity./Experts say reduced lung function could be a fallout of air pollution./Air pollutants such as solid particulate matter (PM) that measure less than 10 micrometres and gases like sulphur and nitrogen dioxide irritate the lung tissue, and over a prolonged period, affect its function./Previous studies conducted among traffic policemen and rickshaw drivers showed poor lung function due to constant exposure to pollutants./Chest specialist Dr Sujeet Rajan said in a city like Mumbai, people who travel by autorickshaws are the worst affected by pollution. ""Buses are good because passengers are seated at a higher level. Passengers in cars and taxi can roll up their windows but there is no such mechanism in autorickshaws,"" he said./Not surprisingly then, the Global Burden of Diseases report, brought out in collaboration with the World Health Organisation, had estimated that air pollution caused more than 6,20,000 premature deaths in India in 2010, making it the fifth leading cause of mortality./""Air pollution results in airway disorders among people, especially children. In the next few decades, it won't be surprising if children are born with weaker lungs,"" said Dr Ashok Mahasur, chest specialist who had done the first air pollution study in Mumbai two decades ago./The Juhu study underlines this lung-air pollution connection. Dr Mehta said he was surprised with his findings because most of the staff members were under 50 years of age. ""These are young people working in an area like Juhu that is closer to the sea. One can imagine how bad it may be in congested areas like Lalbaug,"" he said./In Boston that has cleaner air than Mumbai, studies have shown that people living less than 1km away from the highway have reduced lung function. People living deep inside the city had better lung function, said the doctor./Dr Mahasur, who previously headed the chest medicine department at KEM Hospital in Parel, said, ""In the past, we would make distinctions about certain pockets being good and others being bad, but air pollution is no longer linked to certain pockets. Vehicular emissions, along with construction dust, are the biggest culprits here.""/In the Juhu hospital study, people underwent a spirometry test which showed that 38% had less than normal total exhaled breath capacity while 42.5% had lower total exhaled breath./""We did another study with this group that showed that around 45% of them had allergies that they hadn't sought treatment for,"" said Dr Mehta. The study found that none with allergies were seeking treatment as they felt it was a common cold. Considering that many with nasal allergies go on to develop asthma, the study's findings are worrisome./However, Dr Mahasur said the study's findings need more exploration. ""The study didn't factor in many conditions like the socio-economic background of participants, their nutritional status as well as their exposure or ambient air pollution,"" said Dr Mahasur. He pointed out that previous studies done in India had shown ethnic and regional differences in lung function. ""For instance, lung function of a north Indian is always higher than that of a south Indian and this could be because of diet or growth factors,"" said Dr Mahasur./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Damp Diwali a blessing in disguise for Chennai as pollution levels stay low,"CHENNAI: The downpour on Diwali was a blessing in disguise as rain on Tuesday helped wash away the air pollutants said experts. Keeping with declining popularity of firecrackers, the city recorded a big drop in air and noise pollution levels this Diwali. Nungambakkam and T Nagar were the most polluted area, while Besant Nagar was the least polluted./Triplicane which topped the list last Diwali showed a dramatic drop in pollution. The respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) levels, an indicator of air pollution, remained within the permissible limit (100 micrograms per cubic metre) in most parts of the city. Last year, the RSPM levels were much beyond the permissible limit, with Triplicane recording 297 micrograms per cubic metre./Levels of sulphur dioxide in the air remained within 15 micrograms per cubic metre throughout the city this Diwali as compared to the last when Triplicane recorded 32 micrograms per cubic metre./""While the rainfall reduced use of firecrackers, it also helped disperse the clouds of smoke that would have otherwise lingered and poisoned the air. Rain droplets helped in turning sulphur dioxide to sulphate aerosol and its subsequent dispersion,"" said TNPCB member secretary Karthikeyan./According to data released by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), Nungambakkam recorded 131 micrograms per cubic metre of RSPM on Diwali as compared to 48 micrograms per cubic metre on a regular day (November 5). The permissible RSPM limit, considered safe for human habitation, is 100 micrograms per cubic metre./The RSPM level more than doubled on Diwali as compared to a regular day. The RSPM level at T Nagar rose from 54 micrograms per cubic metre to 126 micrograms per cubic metre on Diwali./Despite the reported reduction in air pollution levels, cases of respiratory illnesses were very high, with city doctors reporting a 50% rise in the number of patients. ""We received about 60 patients on Wednesday after Diwali against the usual count of 35-40 patients a day. Many more made appointments over phone but could not make it due to rain,"" said asthma specialist R Sridharan of the Asthma and Allergy Resource Centre at Mylapore./Noise levels also went up, but not by much, as per the TNPCB data. The noise levels were highest at Besant Nagar which despite recording the lowest air pollution suffered noise that shot up from 76 decibels (dB) on a regular day to 83 dB on Diwali. Crowds gathered at Besant Nagar's Elliots beach shot up noise levels on Diwali./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Northeast air pollution sets alarm bells ringing,"GUWAHATI: Some cities in Assam and the northeast have reported a drastic drop in air quality over the past few years./This was revealed in World Health Organization's 'Ambient (outdoor) Air Pollution (AAP) in Cities Database' released in April this year./Experts termed the pollution situation here 'borderline alarming' and sought effective pollution-curbing policy from the government for the sake of people's health./The report covered 1,600 cities across the world and focused on data collected from monitoring stations in residential, commercial and other areas between 2008 and 2013. The report termed New Delhi 'the most polluted city on the planet'./The air quality in the cities of the northeast was measured in terms of the presence of annual mean concentration of particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5, i.e., particles smaller than 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively) in the air. Particulate matter or PM are coarse or fine particles present in the air that people breathe and most of the particles cannot be seen. They can be in any shape or size and are present in both solid or liquid droplets./The main difference between PM 10 and 2.5 is the size of the particles. Bigger particles are placed between 2.5 and 10 micrometer. The smaller particles, PM 2.5, are smaller than 2.5 micrometer and are 100 times thinner than human hair. The coarse particles of PM 10 mostly comprise smoke, dirt, dust from factories or farms and construction of roads, while PM 2.5 particles comprise those making up automobile exhaust, heavy metals and toxic compounds. They are lighter, float in the air longer and have the ability to traverse long distances. The health risks they pose are many as PM 2.5 can travel deep into human lungs and cause cancer and respiratory problems./Guwahati, Roha, Sivasagar, and Silchar in Assam, along with Dimapur in Nagaland, reported 40, 53, 48, 40 and 40 microgram of PM 2.5 per cubic meter annual mean, respectively. The WHO's safety threshold of PM 2.5 for humans is 10 microgram per cubic meter annual mean./On the other hand, Roha, Nalbari, Nagaon, Guwahati, Dimapur, Sivasagar and Silchar reported 121, 82, 79, 92, 92, 109 and 91 microgram of PM 10 per cubic meter annual mean, respectively./Sharad Gokhale, professor of environmental engineering in the department of civil engineering at IIT-G, said, ""An effective policy in terms of improving traffic infrastructure is the need of the hour. The situation here is not as severe as that in some other cities of the country. But pollution is on the rise here and will ring alarm bells in the near future if it is not tackled.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Docs warn revellers against use of crackers, urge them to go green","PUNE: The firecrackers illuminating the night sky on Diwali can also lead to life-threatening situation for many suffering from respiratory and heart ailments./Therefore, saying no to firecrackers this Diwali is the best resolve one can make during this festive season, said city-based doctors. ""Pollutants emerging from bursting of firecrackers often remain suspended in the atmosphere for days altogether and can aggravate pollution-related allergies,"" they said./And it is not just the pollution that worries experts, who claim that the number of firecracker-related injuries has been increasing with every passing year. ""Not only children, but also onlookers and passers-by fall victim to these fiery sources of joy leaving them with grievous injuries,"" they added./""Every year cases of lung allergies register a sudden rise during this time of the year. Therefore, it is advisable that people suffering from respiratory and heart ailments should take extra precautions,"" said internal medicine expert Arun Suradkar of Columbia Asia hospital./She added that pollutants emerging from firecrackers can aggravate allergic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, bronchial asthma, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, pneumonia and common cold. ""Nitrogen oxide, the most common pollutant released from bursting of firecrackers, aggravates existing skin, eye and respiratory problems leaving many gasping for breath,"" Suradkar said./Burning of firecrackers produces both gaseous as well as particulate matter air pollution which are harmful for lungs, eyes, nose and heart. ""Particulate matters (PM) of less than 2.5 microns in diameter have the ability to reach the deeper portions of the lung and cause damage,"" said Sneha Limaye, senior scientist from Pune-based Chest Research Foundation (CRF)./Limaye recently supervised a study in which levels of particulate matter of less than 2.5 micron were measured during the burning of six most-commonly used firecrackers like fuljhadi (sparklers)./""During the study, we found that snake tablets, laad and pulpul are most harmful crackers,"" said Limaye. The snake tablet, which is popular with the children, produced the highest PM of 2.5 microns, followed by laad, pulpul, fulzadi, chakri and anar, she added./Limaye said, ""Children, in particular, burn sparklers, pulpul and snake tablets barely a foot or two away from them and in doing so inhale a large number of smoke particles that reach deeper into their lung.""/Sharing the view, chest physician Sundeep Salvi, director of CRF, said, ""High levels of air pollutants generated during firecracker burning causes worsening of asthma, allergic diseases of the eyes and nose, respiratory tract infections, pneumonias and heart attacks.""/Firecracker-related injuries range from burned fingers and lacerations to serious disability and permanent loss of vision. ""These injuries are on the rise mainly due to carelessness and ignorance among people,"" said Aditya Kelkar, an eye surgeon./""Eyes are vulnerable and can easily sustain an injury from a firecracker. If there is a burn injury to the eye, cover it with a sterile cotton pad and visit a hospital immediately. If there is a penetrating injury, don't wash the eyes. But if a small particle of the firecracker enters the eye, wash the eye with clean water and consult an ophthalmologist,"" he said./Senior paediatrician Sharad Agarkhedkar, vice-president of the state chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA), said, ""Children are particularly vulnerable during Diwali since they are very enthusiastic about lighting crackers. Children should be informed about the dangers involved in lighting firecrackers. People should make sure that a responsible adult is supervising the children when they are handling crackers.""/The increase in cases of firecracker-related injuries also highlights the need to regulate firecracker use and to enforce safety precautions.

"A week after Centre's order, farm fires in Punjab and Haryana rage unabated","NEW DELHI: Farm fires continue to rage unabated across Punjab and northern Haryana, more than a week after the Centre had asked state governments to urgently check the practice of crop residue burning, latest satellite images reveal./A satellite image from NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) website on Diwali day showed hundreds of 'fire spots' across Punjab and parts of northern Haryana, and haze enveloping north India and beyond./Each 'fire spot' on the image denotes fires on a 1sq km area on the ground./A similar image published in TOI on November 2 had prompted the Union environment ministry to issue a stern letter to four states - Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and UP - asking them to take ""stringent measures including punitive action to prevent and control burning of crop residue and biomass in agricultural fields and apprise the ministry of the action taken in this regard""./""I request you to launch an intense monitoring in your state including through satellite based remote sensing technologies to monitor crop residue management,"" environment secretary Ashok Lavasa had said in his letter to chief secretaries of the states./But as the satellite image reveals, the letter does not seem to have had much effect on the ground. NASA pictures over the past 10 days show crop burning has continued unhindered and may have been a contributor to the thick smog that enveloped national capital region during this period./Experts say smoke from these farm fires worsen the already critical air pollution levels in the capital./Most paddy farmers in Punjab-Haryana burn their crop residues in October-November as it's the cheapest way to prepare the field for the rabi season sowing. The practice grew in scale more than a decade ago as farmers made the transition to combine harvesting machines, which leave behind a long crop stubble./TOI had also reported that the Punjab government was wary of taking action against farmers burning their paddy residues because of recent unrest in the state over the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib and the failure of the cotton crop due to whitefly infestation./Officially, the practice of burning agriculture waste in open fields is banned in Punjab under the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981./The state government's incentives to wean farmers away from the unhealthy practice - such as subsidy for machines like the happy-seeder and shredder, which collect the stubbles - haven't found many takers because of high capital costs./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Choked by Diwali smog, Delhi makes a beeline for air purifiers","The air pollution level in Delhi has been a concern throughout the year, but with Diwali making things worse - by almost 25% - there has been a huge rise in air purifier sales in NCR./Every year the morning after Diwali, Delhi wakes up to a cloud of smog, with the capital's already alarming air pollution level in a much worse state.

"Post Diwali, city wrapped in haze","LUCKNOW: The air pollution levels were lower this Diwali in comparison to last year, but bursting of firecrackers left behind pollutants enough to create a layer of haze which is hovering over the city for past two days. No significant change is expected in the weather conditions till Monday. The minimum temperatures, however, are expected to drop from Tuesday onwards./The maximum temperature on Friday was 30 degrees Celsius, a drop of two degrees in comparison to November 11 (Diwali) while minimum temperature was 15.2 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal./Haze is an atmospheric phenomenon where tiny particles of pollutants accumulate with moisture content in the air and obscure the clarity of the sky. The pollutants obstructed the penetration of sunrays, leading to drop in the maximum temperature. However, the same layer prevented heat from the ground to escape into the atmosphere, resulting in the rise in the minimum temperature./State Met director JP Gupta said that haze will be to clear by Sunday. Further, he added, the western disturbance causing rains and snow in the hills at present is expected to fizzle out by Monday. Thereafter, he predicted, the wind coming from the hills will bring down temperatures in the state./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

""While earlier, we used to receive 6-8 birds a day, it has now gone up to more than 10-12 cases a day. Every year, number of cases go up before and on Diwali,"" said Dr Rajkumar at Jain Bird Hospital, a charitable bird hospital in the old city./Ornithologists say while the loud noise from firecrackers can disorient birds, the high level of air pollution at this time of the year also doesn't help. It has led to several cases of heart strokes and respiration difficulties among birds. There is a direct impact of air and noise pollution on the physical and emotional wellbeing of birds, said Swati Taneja, an ornithologist based in Dehradun. ""Most birds have a sharper sense of hearing than humans, so they get a major shock when crackers are set off. While most birds suffer from acute respiratory diseases and need medical care, many get heart strokes because of high decibel levels on Diwali,"" she said./Birds with relatively smaller body size are the worst affected. ""Birds like the house sparrow, pigeons, mynah and doves are severely affected. Sometimes, ashes from firecrackers fall into their nests and end up burning them or their eggs. It is awful to see beautiful winged creatures in pain,"" said Dr Rajkumar./""Due to paddy burning in Punjab and Haryana, and the drop in temperature, there is already so much air pollution. Firecrackers on Diwali make the situation worse by adding both air and noise pollution. I hope people show a little more sensitivity towards birds,"" he added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

As European countries are the worst victims of allergies, therefore UK started practising this immunotherapy after making it more advanced. We revised the therapy here after studying the UK medical journal""./Allergy patients should take special care because during change in weather conditions these allergies turn into the worst state, said Dr Jain. ""As these allergies are associated with the respiratory system of human beings, they become chronic if not treated in time. A person can become an asthma patient"", he added./""SCIT is like a normal vaccination. In this course, a patient is given a 12 injections through a prescribed schedule within a year. Boosters of four injections are given after a year to develop better resistance against allergies. The course should not be left in between after taking some doses, as is mostly done by patients, because in that case the patients will not get fully cured and may develop a risk of becoming allergic again"", advised Dr Jain./Dr SK Kanaujia, head, ENT department of LLR Hospital said, ""We are getting a very good response from this vaccination therapy from patients.

Many also look old enough to be junk vehicles and they must not be allowed to operate on the roads, even in the fringe areas.

When examined further, she was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a progressive lung disease, which remained undetected all this while./There are several patients like Jyoti who get treatment for heart disease and high blood pressure, but continue to suffer with symptoms of cough and breathlessness which are likely to be caused by the underlying COPD, said experts./""It is quite unfortunate that such patients are often treated for heart ailments and high blood pressure while the underlying COPD remains undetected,"" said chest physician Sundeep Salvi, director of the Pune-based Chest Research Foundation (CRF), which has been conducting research and educational activities in this field for over 10 years. Many physicians and cardiologists do not keep a spirometer, which is the only diagnostic tool for COPD, nor are they aware about the presence of heart disease and hypertension due to the underlying COPD, he added./In a study conducted by CRF, patients attending the cardiology out-patient department (OPD) at the Sassoon General Hospital for the treatment of ischemic heart disease and hypertension underwent spirometry to examine how many of them had underlying COPD. Besides, an equal number of people from the same age group and gender from their family and friend circle, who did not show any symptoms, also underwent spirometry./""Patients with heart disease and hypertension had a four-fold greater risk of having COPD compared to others.

Call to overhaul vehicle PUC system,"PUNE: Fixing the manufacturers' responsibility for the emission performance of their products is the most effective way to curb vehicular pollution, not on-road tests./New Delhi's research group Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) made this observation./Following the Volkswagen incident, experts fear the investment in emission control system in vehicles to meet tighter standards can go waste and negate air pollution control efforts in Indian cities without a robust system for monitoring emission compliance. The carmaker's popular diesel cars were allegedly fitted with 'defeat devices' to trick the official emission tests./""This matter went nearly unnoticed in India except the usual investigation to check if the fraud has happened in India too. But the technical ingenuity of the Volkswagen corporate fraud has exposed weakness and gaps in the emission regulations in India. This makes India extremely vulnerable because it is 'motorising' and 'dieselising' rapidly without the right regulations and compliance framework for manufacturers,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, the executive director of CSE./Vehicular pollution is a serious public health issue in India, where air pollution has emerged as the fifth largest killer. ""Vehicles are responsible for very high exposure to toxic pollution in cities. Monitoring of emission from diesel vehicles is particularly weak. If the emission control system in modern diesel vehicles does not work, it can lead to uncontrolled emission of killer toxic particulates and nitrogen oxides. The pollution under control (PUC) system needs overhaul. The current PUC norms for diesel cars are too lenient to fail any vehicle. They can't check tiny particles and NOx - the key killers in the Indian cities,"" CSE stated in a note issued after its recent deliberations and workshop on the urban air quality./In Pune, where air pollution has emerged as one of the biggest problems.

It cannot screen inherent technical flaws and frauds for which manufacturers are responsible and compromise with the emission performance in the real world, observed the research group CSE./Experts claimed that the PUC system to check emission of on-road vehicles in India was extremely weak in terms of lax norms, poor enforcement and poor quality test procedures. The PUC norms were extremely lax for the older pre-Bharat Stage IV vehicles.

Blueair, a world leader in health enhancing mobile indoor air purification technologies, recently issued a call for greater public awareness about the causes and alleviation of chronic obstruction pulmonary disease (COPD). World Health Organisation (WHO) ranks COPD as one of the leading causes of death in the world - and the second biggest killer in India, taking the lives of around 500,000 men, women and children every year./Human beings on average take 960 breaths every hour and while most of us don't think much about it, this means we are breathing in 10,000 liters of air - and all the nasty stuff in it - each and every day. Even worse, such pollution effects children more than adults because their young lungs are still developing./Vijay Kannan, Head of Blueair India, said, ""It is staggering that a technologically advanced society like India which can successfully put rockets into space does not invest more into protecting the health of its citizens from CODP, which is preventable.""/Dr PM Bhujang, President, Association of Hospital said, ""The metropolitan cities are highly affected with outdoor pollution and one hardly realises how harmful inhaling this polluted air could be.

Blueair urges Indian's mindful of their health and wellbeing to take greater individual responsibility for the indoor air they and those around them breathe. There is not much we can do as individuals about the air pollution in our cities. But we can take simple steps to alleviate the potential consequences of indoor airborne pollution such as COPD by simply installing an air purifier, like those made by Blueair, which can capture up to 99.97% of airborne particles such as smoke, dust, chemicals and fumes.

It has also recommended that LPG be considered as an alternative and coal burning in power plants or otherwise be stopped completely. The IIT Kanpur team recently submitted a draft report which said that vehicles are responsible for 60% of the air pollution in winter./The report, which is based on modelling exercises and on real-time data collected over two-and-a-half years between 2012 and 2015, will be finalised in December once Delhi government officials meet Professor Mukesh Sharma, the lead investigator of the study. ""Vehicles are a major source of pollution in winter and IIT Kanpur has given us a list of recommendations but we have to see which of these can be implemented quickly,"" said Ashwani Kumar, secretary environment, Delhi government./Euro VI norms call for 10 ppm sulphur in diesel compared to 50 ppm sulphur stipulated by the Euro IV standard, which is being used now. ""Even if we consider the present growth rate of vehicles in Delhi, as many as 5 million new vehicles will be added to the existing fleet of 8 million. So implications of not having Bharat Stage VI in PM and NOx emission load will be enormous in terms of health damage. Also, remember the future stock will remain on road for at least 10 years. In view of this, the government should not ignore IIT's recommendations and must bring BS VI not later than 2020,"" said Vivek Chattopadhyay of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)./However, the Auto Fuel Policy Committee for 2025 has recommended Euro V be implemented by April 2020 and Euro VI by April 2024.

Dr Vishal Rastogi, director, heart failure program, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute tells us, ""Heart failure is a condition that occurs when the heart cannot pump or fill with enough blood, which means heart must work harder to deliver the blood to the body. In fact, the term heart failure is misleading, because the heart doesn't completely fail or stop.""/The most common symptoms of heart failure are shortness of breath, swelling in the legs and feet, feeling tired quickly and a fast heart rate, weakness, giddiness./The conditions which lead to heart failure, if treated in early stages can cause reversal of the condition. But unfortunately once fully established the problem progresses relentlessly and may lead to fatal outcomes. With medications and lifestyle modification which include proper diet & exercise, these patients can remain stable for long period of time./Dr Rastogi elaborates, ""These patients are prone to episodes of worsening of symptoms requiring hospitalizations. This worsening is most commonly caused by infections (chest infections), arrhythmia (atrial or ventricular), excess salt or water intake, certain medication & drug abuse (pain killers or alcohol) or worsening renal functions. The aim of long term treatment is to prevent these acute exacerbations, as each episodes can be potentially life threatening. As the weather becomes colder, we see a surge in hospitalization related to heart failure.""/Reasons/- Because of cold weather smog & pollutants settle on ground leading to chest infections & breathing problems./- In winters the BP rises and coronary arteries shrinks leading to lack of blood supply./- As sweating doesn't occur, the extra water gets accumulated in lungs leading to failure symptoms./- Due to weather change various respiratory infections are more common./Prevention/- People with weak heart should be particularly careful during winter season. Though they should continue to exercise regularly, they should modify their timings, so as to avoid extreme weather./- Salt & water intake should be reduced as there is no loss to sweating./- Regularly monitor BP and if detected high, should be properly treated./- Avoiding infections is another important aspect and before the onset of the season, influenza & pneumonia vaccines should be taken so as to prevent chest infections./- If symptoms of infections are seen they should be promptly treated with proper use of antibiotics./- Don't skip your prescribed medication./- Don't skip medicine when you are feeling better/- Any side effects should be reported immediately to your treating doctor/How to detect that you are going to have problem/- One thing that can be easily done at home is, measuring your fluid intake and urine output. If your urine output is consistently less that means fluid is getting accumulated in lungs and sooner it will reflect as heart failure symptoms./- A good surrogate method to measure fluid retention is to record your weight daily. And if you gain 2 kgs weight in three days this means that you are retaining fluid and you should consult your doctor./For more stories, follow us onand/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

The nitrogen dioxide (NO2) level was also well beyond the safe standard at Punjabi Bagh, indicating pollution from traffic./Delhi has been through worse, though. ""There is more fog due to moisture, which is why there seems to be a white layer. Had it been haze, it would be dark. Air pollution levels are high but not severely high. On Sunday, the maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to rise to 30 and 14 degrees Celsius, which will ensure pollution levels fall,"" said Gufran Beig, project director, System of Air Quality and Weather and Forecasting Research (SAFAR) under the ministry of earth sciences./Dense smog persisted at IGI Airport from 11.30pm on Friday to Saturday evening, reducing visibility to 200 metres. The IGI Met department said this was the worst episode after those caused by farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, and Diwali earlier this month./""Our analysis shows this smog is due to pollutants accumulated locally and nothing to do with crop residue burning in neighbouring states. This time it has been more severe due to more moisture available due to easterly winds and relatively low day and night temperatures than in October,"" said a statement released by IGI Met. Their forecast shows that easterly winds will persist and smog may subside as winds strengthen./With the outcry against air pollution becoming louder, the government's announcement on advancing the implementation of Euro V and VI emission norms has cheered activists. Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), however, cautioned that delaying the nationwide extension of Bharat Stage IV emissions standards could be detrimental to public health./Trucks and other heavy diesel vehicles are still at Bharat Stage III standards that are 15 years behind Europe, and they contribute in a big way to local and regional pollution./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
IITR-KGMU pact to study environmental impact on health,"LUCKNOW: Indian Institute of Toxicology Research would enter a memorandum of understanding with King George's Medical University to include the impact of environment on health in research. This would begin with inclusion of impact of air pollution on people in IITR's pre and post-monsoon survey of air quality./As per the MoU, KGMU would provide clinical material for the purpose while IITR would give technical support. The decision was announced at a continuing medical education programme held at KGMU here on Sunday./Director, IITR, Alok Dhawan said, ""Till now, we always looked at the level of pollution in our survey but never worked to quantify the impact on people."" KGMU vice-chancellor Prof Ravi Kant said, ""The benefit of their exercise would reach people and policy makers more effectively if we include the impact in our work.""/IITR would work closely with different KGMU departments, especially pulmonary medicine to examine the effect of air pollution on public health.

Delhi chokes on deadly cocktail of toxic air,"NEW DELHI: Even as the world is in continuing awe of Yoga and its benefits, residents of New Delhi are being advised to avoid all the prescribed breathing exercises. Little wonder that every resident of India's capital is a smoker, thanks to the alarming levels of air pollution here./While warning messages against the actual habit of smoking can be found almost everywhere, there has hardly been any warning to Delhiites against the toxic quality of the air all around. On Monday, Beijing issued an 'orange alert' as PM2.5 particles in the air exceeded 600 micrograms per cubic meter. The city almost went into a lockdown state./Read Also:/In Delhi - about 3700 kilometers away - the PM2.5 particles in the air here touched 530 in Anand Vihar. The city - unlike Beijing - carried on as usual. No warning, no alert, no alarm - just choked lungs and burning eyes./In what is being mocked as a Delhi vs Beijing competition for the right of becoming the world's most polluted city, residents in both capitals are involuntarily gulping down a deadly mix of toxic air. Alarmingly though, the ones in Delhi have not even been issued any guideline to tackle the foul air around them - one that's almost 20 times more higher than the WHO's prescribed safe limit./""It is a global problem and grave problem. We have spoken to all concerned authorities,"" said environment minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday. One look at the air in the capital though reveals that the 'speaking' is clearly not helping./In a city where children staged a protest to demand clean air, where marathoners wore pollution masks during a run, and the chief minister himself is known to have a chronic cough every winter, Delhi is surely a city in need of urgent help. According to senior advocate Kailash Vasdev, a complete lack of coordination among concerned agencies has aggravated a problem which is primarily caused by a crumbling infrastructure./""There is no coordination between the DDA, the PWD, the municipal corporations & the Metro,"" Vasdev told Times Now. ""There is a complete lack of planning, infrastructure, and diesel should not be blamed alone.""/The reasons may be many but at the moment, solutions are either few or shamelessly ineffective. Such is the situation that on Tuesday, the National Green Tribunal demanded authorities hold a crisis meeting to come up with a strategy to tackle the haze. For now though, the center and the Delhi government are trying to show they are working hard to bring things under control, even though their 'efforts aren't reflecting on the ground or in the air./On Tuesday, minister of state for tourism, Mahesh Sharma, told the Rajya Sabha that no country had advised its citizens to not travel to India due to pollution levels. It won't surprise many though if countries the world over actually do warn against an India visit. After all, while Beijing still has an emergency contingency plan in place for when smog envelopes the city, Delhi - and several other cities in the country - are completely lacking the same, despite one being either advised or demanded by all sections of the society./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
London revisited? 1952-like situation in the air,"Doctors Say People With Pre-Existing Respiratory Diseases At Most Risk/The prevailing conditions could lead to Delhi's very own ""Great Smog"". The original Great Smog was the infamous air pollution that London experienced in December 1952. Doctors in the capital are explaining the current fall in Delhi's air quality in terms of the British occurrence, warning that as then, a huge number of lives could be affected, especially of people who have pre-existing respiratory conditions. The burning of crop stubble in the states neighbouring Delhi is producing an effect similar to the Great Smog's to add to the capital's vehicular pollution, explained Dr A B Dey , professor and head of geriatric medicine at AIIMS. He added, ""It will turn acute if urgent measures are not taken."" Dey's caution cannot be taken lightly because an estimated 4,000 people succumbed to respiratory ailments exacerbated by the 1952 smog, which had also forced the English authorities to shut down industrial units and schools and to issue public advisories on places to avoid. While no such drastic action is being contemplated in Delhi, doctors admitted that patients are themselves preferring to stay indoors or leaving the city for a spell./""We tell those suffering respiratory distress to avoid going out during the dawn and dusk hours when pollution levels are at their peak,"" said Dr J C Suri, professor and head of pulmonary medicine at Safdarjang Hospital. The presence of respirable pollutants in the air not only effects breathing, but leads to fresh problems. According to Dr G C Khilnani, professor of pulmonary medicine at AIIMS, when a person inhales, the heavier pollution particles get stuck in the upper respiratory tract leading to sore throat and cough, while smaller particles cause infection of the lower respiratory tract. ""High pollution levels have also been linked with increased risks of heart attacks and strokes,"" he added Persistently high levels of pollution also prolong the recovery period for patients suffering from respiratory illnesses, warned Dr Arup Basu, chest specialist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. He cited the example of a 65-year-old asthma patient in critical condition who has not responded to treatment over five days when he would normally be up and about in two days of care. ""We have tried a range of medications, from antibiotics and steroids to nebulisers, but the patient is still struggling to breathe,"" said Basu./Since children breathe more time every minute than adults, they take in a proportionately greater volume of air, thus increasing their vulnerability. As a global report pointed out, ""Irritation caused by pollutants that would produce only a slight response in an adult can result in potentially significant obstruction in the still-developing airways of a young child.""/Can air purifiers help in such a situation? Most experts are divided on this. ""There is no data to prove their efficacy in reducing pollution's impact on health,"" said Suri. He and other medical experts feel that it is more important to address issues such as vehicular pollution and burning of farm waste at the official level, while getting the vulnerable to avoid crowded areas and peak traffic hours at the individual level./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

While it's mostly pigeons, sparrows, doves and mynahs that are brought in, concerned Gurgaonwallahs are also bringing in sick parrots, parakeets and peacocks. ""About one-fourth of these birds suffer from respiratory or skin diseases caused by air pollution. In birds, polluted air can lead to loss of appetite, pneumonia, asthma and coryza, that causes a burning sensation in their eyes.

Government intensifies action against air pollution,"NEW DELHI: With the National Green Tribunal coming down on Delhi government for the city's deteriorating air quality, the environment department has decided to step up action against polluters. Thursday was the seventh consecutive day when the city witnessed dense smog. Visibility, in fact, worsened on Thursday as it touched a high of only 1,100m against 1,400m on Wednesday./Delhi Pollution Control Committee carried out a special drive for major construction projects towards the end of November and fined 39 of them Rs 50,000 each for dust pollution. NGT has issued specific guidelines to check rising dust pollution in the city, though the norms are not being met across the board. Dust is a major contributor to smog and has emerged as a major concern for environmentalists and doctors alike./A four-member committee, including member secretaries of DPCC, Central Pollution Control Board, secretary health services and environment secretary, met on Thursday at NGT's directions to chalk out an emergency plan to deal with air pollution at specific spots. While the recommendations will be submitted to the court on the next date of hearing (December 11), environment secretary Ashwani Kumar said that the government will be stepping up efforts to curb pollution./""There is some supplementary information that we need to gather to firm up this report. The administration has already put in measures, which will now be intensified. For instance, enforcement of the law against open burning of leaves, garbage and biomass will be stepped up,"" Kumar said./""On Wednesday I wrote to the DCs, commissioners of municipal corporations and the police to ensure strict action against anyone found violating the law. We will also start a public awareness campaign on open burning of waste,"" he added./The government will also be starting a pollution checking drive of vehicles at vulnerable places like Anand Vihar. ""There is massive traffic movement in Anand Vihar area. Random PUC checks will be carried out on vehicles, especially if they are seen to have abnormal emissions. This will be done across various locations for the next few weeks. Another measure that will be enforced strictly is checking of pollution in industrial areas through diesel generator sets, etc,"" said Kumar./Some long-term measures to check dust and smoke, especially for those areas that lack vegetation and see high traffic volumes, have also been decided.

Not just markets, masks have become must-haves for foreigners and people from other cities landing in Delhi and are also available at the IGI Airport./Donning these masks becoming quite the fashion trend among youngsters and sellers say that while earlier it was mostly foreigners who bought these masks, now many youngsters walk in looking for 'anti-pollution masks' and they don't want the white and green surgical ones, but designer ones that come in various colours and prints./'We are out of stock every second day'/At Khan Market, the only place where designer masks are available is a medical store that sells out its stock of over 40-50 masks in two-three days and the demand in increasing. ""There are many foreigners visiting the market, and they walk in asking for masks with single or double filter. Some don't even enquire about different varieties or if there is something available in a lower price range, they readily take whatever is available. We run out of stock in three-four days,"" says Vikas Yadav who works at a medical store in Khan Market. While earlier the demand for these masks was higher among riders and runners, now they have become a part of Delhi's lifestyle, says Gaurav Wadhwa, who has been selling these masks as part of biking gear./Gaurav says, ""Last year, we sold 2-3 masks in a week and now we are selling 2-3 masks every day, that shows how the demand has shot up this year. Earlier, it was mostly cyclists, bikers or runners who came looking for these masks, but now, they are being bought by everyone and people say that it is difficult to breathe without these."" A customer at his shop, Pankaj Dhiman from Faridabad, tells us that he can't ride his bike in Delhi without a mask. ""I didn't wear a mask for three days and now my throat is all choked. Masks are the only way to keep yourself safe from this poisonous air,"" he says./Laura Bertsche, from Switzerland, has been staying in Delhi for six years, but this year she says she just couldn't do without a mask. She says, ""It has become a part of my outfit now, even if I'm stepping out for a small walk near my house in Vasant Vihar, I don't go without my mask. Once you start wearing it, you can feel the difference, you don't feel that you are breathing in all the dust around you. I have been advising everyone I know to wear masks.""/Bandana or surgical?/Most designer masks come with a single valve for exhaling air and the ones with two valves are recommended for those who wear masks while working out or jogging. ""There is a wide variety available in the market. There are bandana masks which are as good as scarves. Then there are surgical masks that come with N95 ratings and there are superior quality designer masks that have good filters. The masks with one valve could be used for a year, but now as the pollution levels are higher, we recommend customers to change/replace them after 10 months,"" says Gaurav./RM Kapoor, owner of a pharmacy shop at Yusuf Sarai, adds, ""Keeping in mind the pollution levels, masks with filters are a must for people suffering from any respiratory disorder. Others can go for simple masks (without valves or filters) that just cover your face and stop the dust.""/Price no deterrent/These masks are available at various price ranges. The surgical masks, also called N95 masks, are the cheapest at Rs 80. The bandana or cloth masks start from the price range of Rs 250-400. But interestingly, the sale of these masks is much less compared to the sale of designer masks that are priced between Rs 2,000 and Rs 2,800. ""Sale of regular masks or surgical masks is limited to those who are advised by the doctors to use them. Those who want protection from the toxic air are investing in a good designer mask,"" says Rajesh who has a shop in Yusuf Sarai./Bikers take their masks very seriously and the leather masks available for them come at a price of Rs 2,800. Says Dhiman, ""I am planning to go on a bike trip soon and if I go without a good mask, I will fall sick. Buying these masks is an investment today.""/Masks do provide relief/Doctors dealing with respiratory ailments say that in the last few months, they have asked many patients to wear masks. ""I have asked around three patients who came with wheezing problems to wear masks and it has provided them some relief. There are many micro particles present in the air and masks with N95 and N99 ratings stop them to an extent. Earlier, only surgical masks were available, but it was not possible for everyone to wear them as people feel suffocated in them. The high quality masks that are available in markets today are made with quality fabric,"" says Dr Avi Kumar, consultant respiratory medicine./While single layered masks, which are as good as a piece of cloth covering your nose and mouth, are effective up to 50-60% in preventing the air-borne particles from entering in the body, N95 masks and those with higher ratings are effective up to 95%, says Dr Srikant Sharma, senior consultant physician. ""These masks are recommended for those suffering from respiratory diseases, children, elderly and others who regularly go out for running, jogging or workout during the morning when there is smog. The air-borne particles that make the air toxic are highest when there is smog and people inhaling these can suffer from lung and heart diseases,"" says Dr Srikant./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Bareilly air quality plummets with cold weather,"Bareilly: The air quality in the city has plummeted in the last week, with the level of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM), an important indicator, registering a dramatic rise. As per the Air Pollution Monitoring Centre (APMC), the levels of RSPM at Rampur Garden and IVRI have gone up by 119% and 30% respectively over this period and now hover far above the permissible limit./The data from APMC has revealed that the level of RSPM on Tuesday was found to be 462 and 260 microgram per cubic metre (pcm) at Rampur Garden and IVRI, respectively. However, a week ago, the figure was 210 and 200 microgram pcm at Rampur Garden and IVRI, respectively. The permissible limit for RSPM, as prescribed by National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), 2009, is only 100 microgram pcm./Explaining the reason behind the sudden increase in air pollution, emeritus Prof DK Saxena, in-charge, APMC, said, ""The suspended particulate matter is released from burning diesel and petrol. When the sky is clear, it goes up and disperses with air current. It also travels a short distance with the air currents. In the past week, low temperatures have caused air condensation, due to which water converted into dew and settled down gradually. Along with this dew, the suspended particulate matter, which are supposed to travel away due to wind currents, now settles down locally. The cloud becomes heavy and opaque because of suspended particulate matter. Local residents are therefore unable to receive sunlight.""/According to experts, an increase in RSPM level causes respiratory diseases. ""Air pollution is the root cause of pulmonary diseases,"" said Saxena. As per weather experts, the temperature in the city will further drop in the next two days. Senior meteorologist and faculty member of GB Pant University, Pant Nagar, HS Kushwaha said, ""Western disturbance has been reported in North India. Though Jammu and Kashmir and parts of Himanchal Pradesh will receive rainfall, the chance of rainfall in Western Uttar Pradesh is low. However, medium and heavy clouds will persist for three to four days and weather will become colder than in the previous days."" He added that medium fog will remain over the next few days./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"NGT asks UP, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab govts to ask farmers to stop burning wastes","NOIDA: In a hearing related on the issue of air-pollution, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Thursday directed the state governments of UP, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab to facilitate information dissemination among the farming community of these states to not burn agriculture waste on the fields./Burning of leftover chaff and stalks of wheat and other agriculture waste after harvesting is one of the major causes of air pollution in North India. An earlier order from the green court this month, already prohibits the burning of waste on fields. The directive from the court on Thursday is expected to enforce the earlier order and to take it to the ground./""A Nasa picture has clearly depicted how during the harvesting season of December-January and once again in May-June, smoke clouds are created over farming fields of Punjab. These clouds travel towards the rest of the country creating a blanket of pollution in the air and the resulting smog. The carbon emission from agriculture waste is maximum from the burning of left over stalks and chaff. Because of a proper system of disposing these wastes, the farmers believe in burning them. The NGT has already prohibited this via an earlier order and now today's order will enforce the states to follow up on it,"" Rahul Chaudhary, advocate in favour of applicant Vikrant Tongad in the NGT told TOI./""We have been working with the farming communities of Noida and Greater Noida atleast and have been propagating the knowledge of converting agri-waste into fodder for cattle; farmers operate on traditional knowledge and they still believe that burnt ashes of wheat stalks and chaff lead to the fertile soil. But the perception is changing slowly,"" Vikrant Tongad, applicant of the case stated./""It will now become the responsibility of every State to reach out to the farmers. At times stretches of acres of farming land are set on light by farmers. The thick dark cloud created over the fields slowly spread all over the sky. We hope this order will be implemented during the current harvesting season,"" Chaudhary said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Green shoots: The best air purifiers cost the least,"New Delhi: It's not just air purifiers, but the sale of indoor plants have also increased with the decline in air quality in Delhi. The demand for plants such as Sansevieria, Areca Palm, English Ivy and Boston fern, which are known to reduce the negative impact of toxic fumes, have gone up./Nursery owners say people are buying them by the dozen to counter the impact of pollution, particularly if they have a family member with respiratory illness. Those with little space to put flower pots are opting for vertical gardens, a concept utilised successfully at Rashtrapati Bhawan./""Sansevieria, also referred to as mother-in-law's tongue perhaps because of its sharp leaves, is the most popular. While most plants imbibe oxygen at night, this one released it at night,"" said A M Khan, owner of Rajdhani Nursery in Jor Bagh of South Delhi. ""A few years ago, there were no takers for this plant and we dumped nearly 2,000 of them. But now we are searching for it from our suppliers in Karnataka, Trivendrum and other places due to the increased demand,"" he added./Padmachand Saini, owner of Joginder Nursery, said the sale of plants known for their air purifying qualities have gone up 40% post-Diwali./There are few studies to show the science behind the belief that plants help curb pollution. One of them, which proponents the theory and horticulturalists like Saini refer to, is done by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). It states: ""Low-light requiring houseplants, along with activated carbon plant filters, have demonstrated the potential for improving indoor air quality by removing trace organic pollutants from the air in energy efficient building.""/Dr Sandeep Salvi, director of the Pune-based Chest Research Foundation, claimed the theory about certain plants helping improve indoor air quality has also been proved through exposure experiments. ""The microbes in soil and leaves absorb volatile chemicals, thus reducing pollution,"" he said./Some of the buyers whom TOI spoke to said that plants are a good idea, regardless of whether it is backed by science or not. ""Our cities have turned into concrete jungles. We must change it for better health. In-house plantation and making the back lanes green is my way of doing it,"" said Payal Kapoor, a resident of Safdarjung Enclave./As per the 2010 global burden of disease report, outdoor air pollution caused more than 6.2 lakh premature deaths in India and nearly 18 million healthy years of life were lost that year./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Moradabad air quality plummets to hazardous levels: Survey,"Moradabad: The air quality in Moradabad is plummeting at an alarming rate, according to an exhaustive study by a team of researchers from Hindu College here. In particular, respirable suspended particulate matter in the city air has reached 360 microgram per cubic metre, compared to the maximum permissible limit of 100 set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)./""The high concentration of RSPM in the air can cause major respiratory diseases like asthma, cancer and tuberculosis. The level of RSPM has been steadily increasing for the past five years,"" said Anamika Tripathi of the National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAAQMP), project co-ordinator, talking to TOI./Research scholars involved in the survey collected samples through respirable dust machines which are installed at commercial, residential and industrial areas of the city. Air samples were taken from Police Training Centre (PTC), Buddh Bazar, Mughalpura, Nagfani and Daulatbagh. The results indicate that despite numerous studies ringing the alarm at repeated intervals, political inaction and administrative apathy has turned the air of the Brass City toxic and a major public health disaster is in the making./""For the last five years, our research scholars have carried out the survey and sent the report to the ministry of environment and to the Central Pollution Control Board. The present study deals with the assessment of ambient air quality with respect to total suspended particulates (TSP), respirable suspended particulate matter (PM10), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over a period of five years from September 2010 to August 2015,"" said Tripathi, who added that the main reason behind growing air pollution is the burning of e-waste and brass sheets inside the ghettos of the city./""Although PTC appears to be a clean area, it falls under the moderate pollution category, with an index value of 68.78. This may be due to fossil fuel combustion at the outskirts of the parade grounds and burning of dry leaves inside the area,"" the researchers said. Buddh Bazar, which is a commercial area, falls under high air pollution category with RSPM found to be 200 microgram per cubic metre. This site near the railway station is extremely congested, resulting in slow movement of vehicles, long waits at the signals and a large number of vehicles running during the day and night./""Mughalpura is an industrial area and has very high pollution levels, mainly due to industrial activity like brassware units. Five heavy metals - copper, zinc, iron, cadmium ad lead - were also observed at all the sites. Among the metals, highest concentration of zinc was recorded at almost all the sites, whereas copper and iron was found higher at industrial sites, possibly due to brassware units,"" Tripathi added. The highest level of RSPM was found at Nagfani, Mughalpura and Daulatbagh, at between 240 and 260 microgram per cubic metre./""Soil samples collected from Nagfani and Daulatbagh areas were found carrying cadmium, zinc, lead, chromium and other metals, which cause serious hazards to the human body,"" said research scholar Mahima Singh, adding that the toxic substances in the air and easily enter the human body via the lungs, and then into the bloodstream./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Campaign to highlight health effects of secondhand smoke on children,"MUMBAI: World Lung Foundation (WLF) has congratulated the Maharashtra government on a new mass media campaign, which warns people about the hazardous effects of secondhand smoke (SHS) on children./The campaign 'Tobacco Is Eating Your Baby Alive' uses graphic imagery to highlight how exposure to tobacco smoke can cause Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), asthma, ear infection, pneumonia and even low birth weight among new-borns. The campaign has been adapted especially for Maharashtra in Marathi language and was developed with technical and financial support from WLF./The 30-second public service announcement (PSA) will be broadcast on all major TV and radio channels across the state till end of December. It describes how smoking around children causes them to be exposed to the thousands of poisonous chemicals in SHS, including cyanide and carbon monoxide/According to the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), over 12% of adult males in Maharashtra smoke tobacco and many children and young people in the state are exposed to secondhand smoke. Dr Nandita Murukutla, WLF's country director said, ""This campaign will play a vital role in warning the citizens of Maharashtra about the terrible harms of secondhand smoke (SHS) to children. Global research shows that at least 40 percent of children are regularly exposed to SHS at home, and 50 percent of children regularly breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke in public places,""./According to the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (India), at least 21 percent of children aged 13-15 years old report being exposed to SHS at home, and at least 36 percent are exposed to SHS outside the home. Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi of Tata Memorial Hospital said, ""We should be consistent in delivering blunt warnings about the harms of exposure to secondhand smoke. Hard hitting ads such as 'Tobacco is Eating Your Baby Alive' are essential to rebut tobacco industry misinformation and to keep reminding people that they urgently need to quit smoking and to stop exposing others to secondhand smoke. As a cancer surgeon who sees many cases of tobacco-related cancer, even among young parents, I am delighted that people in Maharashtra are being exposed to such a significant health message.""/Chaturvedi added that tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of mortality in the world today, and is responsible for more than five million deaths each year-one in ten preventable deaths worldwide./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
42% of Bengaluru's footpaths unwalkable,"BENGALURU: More than 40% of Bengaluru's footpaths are pedestrian-unfriendly, shows a study by Janaagraha, which has come out with a Street Quality Score done on 3,318 km of roads across the city./The study measured the quality of street infrastruc ture, which includes footpaths, pedestrian crossings, street lighting, bus stops and air pollution levels./The survey was conducted The survey was from September to November. Only 1,928 km, or 58%, of the 3,318 km of streets surveyed have walkable footpaths./""In the absence of any standard measure of walk ability of a footpath, we con sidered a footpath walkable if two people can walk on it side by side without having to step ut having to step on to the road./In many plac es, footpaths were absent; in other places, they were en croached upon. Also, mirror ing the negligence of the gov ernments, footpaths in outer zones are worst (with only 45% walkability) compared to inner zones (75% walkability),"" said a volunteer with the study team./The study also found that only 279 intersections (9%) of the 3,256 intersections surveyed have usable pedestrian crossings. How good is Bengaluru's street infra structure? Pretty bad, going by Janaa graha's Street Quality Score 2015 done on 3,500 km of roads across the city ./The aim of the study was to measure the quality of street infrastructure, which included factors such as footpaths, pedestrian crossings, street lighting, bus-stops and air pollution levels./Nightmare for pedestrians/""While pedestrians are mostly dependent on zebra crossings, we found only 261 such crossings. Only 12 skywalks were found usable. The number subways in a usable state is only six. A usable pedestrian crossing... is a clearly demarcated zebra crossing with a working traffic signal or an accessible and well-lit subway or an accessible and welllit skywalk,"" said a team member./Poor street lighting/The study put the city's street lighting score at 8 lux. Lux is unit of luminance and luminous emittance, measuring luminous flux per unit area. This is used as a measure of the intensity as perceived by the human eye, of light that hits or passes through a surface./""Average streetlighting on 3,075 km of streets that we surveyed is 8 lux.

'Poor' rating for city's air but we are better off than Delhi,"MUMBAI: The quality of air in the city has deteriorated considerably over the past few weeks with many areas, particularly in the suburbs, faring between 'poor to very poor' in the air quality index (AQI). Combined with a nip in temperature, the polluted air has led to a substantial rise in respiratory illnesses. The real-time data on the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) mobile application on Sunday evening indicated that the AQI all over Mumbai was 'poor' at 224. Though it may be rated much better than Delhi's toxic levels (above 400), it could still lead to health complications in those with pre-existing heart or lung diseases. Even individual pockets such as Chembur, Andheri and Bhandup fell into the 'poor category'./The index got worse in areas such as Malad, where it touched 328. At such a level, even healthy lungs could get affected with prolonged exposure. Neha Parkhi, senior programme officer of SAFAR, said pollution levels are always related to weather parameters. ""Pollutant levels increase during winter every year. The pollution levels are highest during 8pm-7am, when temperature is relatively lower, and gets better as the day progresses,"" she said. The minimum temperatures recorded by the IMD Santacruz observatory on Saturday was16.8 degrees Celsius, the season's lowest./Pollution levels, particularly nitrogen oxide (NOx) and suspended particulate matter (SPM), usually rise with a nip in the temperature. Anything above 100 micrograms of SPM in a cubic metre of air is bad for human health. Often in winter it goes above 250 for the city. ""As it gets cooler, SPM matter of all variety comes and stays down and people inhale that,"" said Dr Sanjeev Mehta, adding that chronic ex posure to polluted air could cause long-term damage./Citizens are also getting increasingly worried about the deteriorating air quality and near absence of initiatives to arrest it. Colaba resident Subhash Motwani, president of the Clean Heritage Colaba Residents' Association (CHCRA), recently wrote an open letter to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta about rising air pollution levels. ""It is only a matter of time before travel advisories are issued by most countries, advising their citizens not to travel to Delhi and Mumbai due to extremely high levels of pollution,"" he said. ""We have time to take pre-emptive action before the entire city becomes unsafe for people,"" said Motwani./While the jury is out over Delhi's odd-even driving rule, citizens feel it is at least a step to wards acknowledging the dangers of air pollution./A 'National Health Profile 2015' report by the Union health ministry showed cases of acute respiratory infection have risen by five million since 2012. A 2014 WHO report highlighted how lung diseases contributed to over 11% of deaths in the country .

It also cited data which showed that cancer was on the increase in urban areas./Noting that Punjab was the 'cancer capital of India', the CSE report presented evidence suggesting rampant use of pesticides in the state and people's exposure to the chemicals they comprise. It said pesticides had found their way into tap water, groundwater, and food in Punjab, where incidence of cancer was almost twice the national average. Chemicals present in pesticides could suppress the immune system, triggering diseases that could be fatal, the report said. ""Since no doctor will issue a death certificate saying that the cause is an unknown trigger, the industry is safe,"" said Narain./She said the report had made detailed recommendations on how to regulate pesticide use in the country./""Globally, the maximum residue limits (MRLs) of pesticides are reviewed periodically to incorporate changes in dietary pattern and agricultural practices. But in India, MRLs for registered pesticides are incomplete and have not been reviewed periodically,"" she said./She said air pollution was one of the top 10 killers in the world and was the fifth leading cause of deaths in India./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Poison in the air at city traffic junctions takes breath away,"THANE: A majority of traffic junctions in the city are spewing high levels of toxic fumes enough to make one sick and prone to various ailments if exposed for a long time./According to a study by TMC, of the 11 traffic junctions in Thane, seven have been declared as dangerous black spots. Of these, Gaondevi junction has the most polluted air followed by Kalwa junction and Balkum, where air pollution index is higher than even 100%. At the other four junctions it hovers between 75% and 100%, which again is way above permissible limits./In comparison, at Wagle, Modella and Nitin junctions the air quality is moderate. A report on the presence of carbon monoxide shows that Cadbury junction has the highest density of this pollutant./The study report presented in the environment survey report stated that excessive exposure to such air could lead to people developing breathing problems along with damage to the kidney. It could also affect normal sleep patterns./Excessively high traces of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) was found at Gaondevi where the density is highest at 572 milligram/ cubic metre (mg/m3), followed by Kalwa and Balkum that also have RSPM levels well above the normal 100mg/m3./Experts blamed heavy traffic, the high density causing vehicles to move slowly and longer waiting period at signals to be the main reasons for the rising air pollution levels. Motorists often keep the engines roaring while waiting at signals, which added to the increase in toxicity./Vidyadhar Walawalkar of NGO Paryavaran Dakshata Manch said that vehicles should be running at 40-50kmph to ensure optimal fuel usage and minimal emissions, a fact that is nearly impossible to attain in Thane. ""Vehicles that run at 45-50 kmph optimally utilize the fuel and there is very less emission. Vehicles on Thane roads move at a very slow pace leaving behind a trail of harmful smoke that eventually chokes the surroundings,"" he said./Environment experts said it was high time residents and authorities started taking the rising pollution levels seriously. ""The solution is to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. Simultaneously, it also needs to be ensured that there is enough green cover in the areas that have high levels of pollution. Trees not only maintain oxygen levels but also absorb a lot of sound, thus creating a change in the environment,"" said eco-activist, Ajay Marathe./Thane traffic police said they were doing their best to ensure the traffic is kept moving always. ""We are always on our feet to ensure the traffic is moving but motorists often keep the engines running even while waiting at signals, which leads to increase in air pollution,"" said a traffic cop manning a busy junction in Thane./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Lecture held at Chandigarh on Lung Cancer,"CHANDIGARH: In the wake of the Lung Cancer trend in India, Dr. Jatin Sarin, Consultant Cancer Specialist at Chandigarh Cancer and Diagnostic Centre addressed a media briefing to increase awareness on the growing Lung Cancer cases./He said timely, appropriate diagnosis and the strong potential of the novel Targeted Therapy with personalized medicine is essential for successful treatment and cure of the lung cancer./Highlighting incidence and causes of Lung Cancer in Chandigarh, Dr. Sarin said, ""In the past year, I have observed an increase in lung cancer cases and significant increase in lung cancer deaths in Chandigarh. Lung Cancer incidence is observed to be higher in men as compared to women. Smoking, tobacco and exposure to cancer causing agents such as asbestos, radon, air pollution and diesel exhaust have been major causes of Lung Cancer in Chandigarh. The risk of acquiring Lung Cancer can be controlled by preventing exposure to these carcinogens.""/According to Globocan 2012, last updated study on Lung Cancer, incidence rate is 70,000 cases and mortality rate is 63,000 cases. Lung Cancer is the second most common cancer among men in India. Smoking tobacco continues to be the major contributor to the disease. Whatever be the prevalence, lung cancer, it is giant killer and is responsible for maximum cancer related mortality all over the world./Lung cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in one or both lungs forming one of the three types of tumors - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) , Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC), and Lung Carcinoid tumor. NSCLC is the commonest variety with maximum incidence./Stressing on the importance of timely diagnosis of Lung Cancer, Dr Sarin said, ""In a country where tuberculosis is rampant, it is common to find a lung cancer patient being treated for tuberculosis initially. Most patients in Chandigarh are diagnosed in advanced stages, where cure is not possible but only treatment to prolong survival. Appropriate, early diagnosis is important for successful treatment and cure. If any of the signs and symptoms are evident, it is advisable to visit your doctor. CT scan, Tissue biopsy and Sputum cytology are the recommended diagnostics tests for lung cancer./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Govt turns to aam aadmi to fight war on pollution,"New Delhi: The next time you see a vehicle belching out toxic smoke in the city, you may be able to get it challaned. One of the highlights of the Delhi government's 13-point agenda to deal with air pollution was crowdsourcing of complaints against visibly polluting vehicles. The Swachh Delhi App has already started receiving such complaints that are being forwarded to the transport department, said government officials. But transport department sources claim that guidelines on how to deal with such complaints have not been framed yet./According to the sources, a missing link in the entire process is the lack of clarity about norms for vehicles coming from other states. For the ones plying in Delhi, the preliminary plan is to send a notice and then challan the polluting vehicles. Complaints against visibly polluting industries can also be made on the app. These will then be forwarded to Delhi Pollution Control Committee./Spotting visibly polluting vehicles to ensure emission compliance is a tried-and-tested strategy in many countries simply because it instils fear in those who have flouted pollution norms or have been driving without a valid PUC certificate. According to International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), in Beijing ""spot checks and public spotter programmes are used to test on-road vehicles with high emission potential or those that visibly emit black smoke"". Local authorities there create checkpoints by the roadside or in parking lots and conduct emission tests./They also encourage citizens to voluntarily report the licence plate numbers of smoky vehicles. Even financial incentives are given to spotters in some places. In Hong Kong, the government claims that there is a 50% reduction in smoky vehicles since the strategy was implemented in 1988. Volunteers have to join a training course offered by the Hong Kong administration in spotting polluting vehicles. The training includes identifying vehicle classes, visual assessment of smoke levels, etc./Delhi doesn't have such advanced testing mechanism but officials in the transport department said there are legal provisions to fine polluting vehicles under the Motor Vehicle Act. Anumita Roychowdhury, head of CSE's clean air campaign, said a Hong Kong-type spotting programme can be very effective. ""In any case, smoky vehicles should be flagged and tested. We have more than 500 PUC centres, then why can't it be done? If there is regular checking, the fear of getting caught will be instilled.""/Amit Bhatt, strategy head, integrated urban transport at Embarq, said most smoky vehicles are either old diesel vehicles or commercial vehicles. ""When a challan is sent to the owner of a vehicle emitting smoke, his/her address may have changed. The challans will keep accumulating until the owner tries to sell the vehicle. That's when these challans will be settled. Often people don't even sell these vehicles. So, the Delhi government needs to devise some other way of challaning visibly polluting vehicles,"" said Bhatt./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"3,860 rural kitchens go smokeless","In rural Karnataka, 3,860 households will no longer have to waste time over fetching precious firewood, inhale soot or blow their lungs out to cook a day's meal. All houses got brand new LPG connections within a month under the Mission Smokeless Village./Ramanagaram district ranks first in terms of LPG penetration with 1,997 new installations of gas cylinders followed by Chikkaballapur with 437 and Chitradurga with 264 new LPG installations, reports IndianOil. So far 60 villages in Karnataka have been declares smokeless./Stressing the need to turn rural India and Karnataka smokefree, Indrajit Bose, executive director (corporate communications and branding) IndianOil, said: ""Rural women continue to toil to fetch fire wood, crop residues and cattle dung daily to light up their chulha. This results not only in waste of energy and time, but also to severe health hazards among kids and adults.""/""Over four million people undergo premature deaths annually due to household air pollution from cooking with solid fuels and 50% of deaths among children below 5 years of age are attributable to pneumonia caused by soot inhaled from indoor air pollution.Exposure to indoor pollution is equivalent to smoking 400 cigarettes a day,"" he added./S Varadachari, general manager in-charge, IndianOil, Karnataka chapter, said: ""Our team from Bengaluru had to do extensive footwork, visiting villagers door to door and educating them about the need to switch to LPG mode. The elected members of panchayats from all these vil lages were called for a discussion on the mission. A detailed survey was conducted of all houses to ascertain LPG connections, ventilation, kitchen platform and affordability.""/""LPG registration camps were conducted in each village and value added measures were adopted to enrol customers. After the final survey that ascertained that every villager had LPG connection, the village was officially declared smokeless by the panchayat,"" he added./Abhijit Dey, DGM (LPG), Karnataka, said: ""Installation of LPG has double benefit. The villagers would now have a bank account and their LPG subsidy would go to their accounts, besides improving their health.""/Times View/It's laudable that IndianOil is ensuring a clean, healthy and smokefree environment in rural India. Its Mission Smokeless Villages is reaching many households in the hinterland that earlier depended on the scarce and precious firewood for cooking and other purposes. By offering LPG connections to villagers, it's ensuring that the fruits of development are not consumed by a minuscule section of society alone. Such steps in social inclusion will hopefully lead to better standards of living for a vast majority residing in villages. The government must also ensure that the supply of LPG is consistent and smooth./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Slow death by Diesel,"The general prefernce for diesel vehicles is turning the air in Gujarat's cities toxic. In Gujarat today, around 1.21 crore vehicles, including two-wheelers, guzzle 18 crore litres of petrol a month. In stark contrast, just 24.06 lakh diesel vehicles burn a whopping 50 crore litres of the fuel which is almost three times the amount of petrol used! The exhaust of cars, buses and trucks using diesel ontain fine particles that stay suspended in the air for a long period of time. These particulate matter enter our lungs with the air we breathe. The smaller the par ticle the more dangerous it is./The respirable particulate matter-they are from The respirable particulate matter-they are from 10 microns to 2.5 microns in size (PM10 to PM2.5) cause cancer and heart disease. Particulate matter of PM2.5 size can enter our blood streams and travel to other parts of the body affecting their functioning adversely . functioning adversely./Ahmedabad, which uses almost 2.5 crore litres of diesel a month -the highest in the state --was rated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as the 10th most polluted city in the world with a PM 2.5-level exceeding 100 microgram per cubic metre. The permissible limit for PM2.5 is just 60 micrograms per cubic meter./The Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the Union Ministry of Petroleum And Natural Gas had claimed in 2013 that even the latest Bharat Stage (BS) IV compliant diesel cars emit 25 gm of PM 2.5 particulates for every 1,000 km they travel. This is seven times more PM 2.5 emission than cars using petrol./Further, diesel cars emit thrice the amount of nitrogen oxides than petrol driven vehicles. One can imagine what damage the 3.07 lakh diesel vehicles on Ahmedabad roads must have done to the purity of the city's air! On December 14, Ahmedabad's Maninagar area recorded PM 2.5 levels of 184 microgram per cubic meter during peak hours. This is not only almost three times the permitted limit but even higher than Beijing. The Chinese capital had recorded a PM2.5 concentration of 139.microgramm\xB3 on December 10. In the case of PM10-the particulate matter that causes diseases in the upper respiratory tract--Surat and Vadodara have exceeded the permitted limit. It is alarming that Rajkot has not been measuring ambient air pollution since April this year! One may ask why don't diesel vehicles, particularly buses and trucks, switch to CNG when both fuels cost almost the same. (In Ahmedabad, diesel is priced at Rs 49.48 a litre while a kilo of CNG costs Rs 46.75.) Sources in the urban development department said the reason CNG buses are not prefered is they have higher operation and maintenance cost./GPCB member secretary Hardik Shah said thousands of trucks from all over the country enter Gujarat cities during the night. ""Some are BSII compliant, some BSIII while some are even older. They contribute a lot to the city's air pollution,"" said Shah. Director general of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), Sunita Narain, told TOI that, in 2004, the Supreme Court-appointed Bhure Lal committee had pushed for CNG and strengthening of public transport in Ahmedabad and other Gujarat cities./""Unless that happens, Gujarat cities will continue to turn into gas chambers. Diesel vehicles will only make the situation worse,"" she said. Founder of Centre for Environment Education (CEE) Kartikeya Sarabhai told TOI that the focus should be on reducing traffic densities.""Today I see diesel driven SUVs and cars with just one passenger.

Dusty roads add air pollution woes in city,"BHUBANESWAR: Dusts were seen lying scattered over several roads in the city. When a vehicle passes through the roads, suddenly a cloud of dusts appear and leave the passerby gasp for fresh breath./Mostly street roads and arterial roads are dustier than the major roads like Janpath, Governor?s house to KIIT square, Bidyut Marg and AG Square to Airport. Even the national highway (NH16) passing through the city has dusts and sands at both sides of the road./Though the Bhubaneswar municipal corporation (BMC) is claiming that it cleans the road regularly, but real situation is different./Areas like Baramunda, Nayapalli, Mancheswar, Rasulgarh, Khandagiri and unit-8 witness dusts on its roads. ?Due to the bad roads, potholes and ill maintenance of street and arterial roads, dusts and sands get deposited on it creating health problems,? said Jyoti Ranjan Das of Baramunda./Dusts in the roads contribute to air pollution. ?It is a main component of the suspended particulate matter (SPM) that pollutes air. Unlike summer season, the dust particle in winter gets concentrated in the air,? Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB) senior environmental engineer Nihar Ranjan Sahu./The SPM, a dangerous particle which degrade the air quality, has been increased in the air of the city atmosphere. According to a scientist of the OSPCB, 100 microgram SPM in atmosphere is tolerable, but more than this would impact on the health of the people of the city. Quantity of SPM at the locations like IRC Village, Rasulgarh and Unit-1 in the city is higher than other places, sources said./It not only pollutes the city?s air, but also poses health threat to people residing here. ?Polluted air makes a person?s lungs weak.

'Diesel ban to cut pollution by 30%',"GURGAON: The ban on registration of new diesel vehicles is being seen as a temporary measure in the fight against pollution, but environmental experts say air pollution could be reduced by almost 30% if the number of diesel vehicles on roads could be brought down significantly./According to a Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) scientist, 60% of diesel vehicles in the city are not serviced regularly and are a major source of pollution. ""Over 90% particles emitted by diesel engines are extremely fine, which increases the level of pollutants. I think pollution level in the city should come down by 30% if the ban is implemented properly. CNG is a good alternative and will drastically bring down pollutants as compared to the existing level,"" the scientist told TOI./HSPCB has issued a letter to the road and transport authority asking them not to provide fitness certificates to diesel autos in the city. There are more than 35,000 diesel vehicles used for public transport, which include shared autos, private taxis and buses, which are a major source of particulate matter (PM) emissions in the transport sector./An analysis done by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) shows that diesel engines are primary contributors of particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen. One diesel engine, on an average, produces 12% carbon dioxide, 17% ozone gas, 59% nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, and the rest is water vapour./Niranjan Raje, a member of expert appraisal aommittee of the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) and a member of the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), said, ""When compared to petrol engines, diesel engines produce 20 to 100 times more particles and about 90 per cent these particles are very minute. Shockingly, with an improved diesel fuel quality, the engine might get efficient, but the amount of PM2.5 also multiplies. Emissions by diesel engines are therefore a major source of pollutants.""/Experts pointed out that the shift to CNG engines will be beneficial as they don't emit sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Besides, CNG run engines emit 80% less nitrogen oxides than diesel engines./Doctors highlighted a correlation between the increase in use of diesel vehicles and the rise in respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Dr Kumar Srivastava, a pulmonogist, said, ""We have seen about 150% rise in cases of respiratory ailments in the last 15 years. It happened after an increase in the availability of diesel vehicles and use of diesel gensets in residential societies for power back-up. Diesel contributes to exposure of PM2.5, which can cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.""/Long-term exposure to the pollutants is also responsible for reduced lung function and diseases such as asthma and chronic bronchitis.

""With no strong (northerly) breeze, the pollutants generated in Mumbai haven't been getting diluted,'' he added./As a result, higher than usual portions of microscopic particulate matter are present in the respirable air range. Exposure to particulate matter has been linked to heart problems and attack, cancer as well as allergies./There is another reason for the city's higher-than-usual pollution level. Dr Gufran Beig, chief project scientist from SAFAR, said the city's easterly winds have been unusually active for this period. ""The easterly winds have been blowing the pollutants generated from the city's eastern side into the city.''/Chest specialist Dr Rohini Chowghule said rising pollution levels in winter months can be traced to burning of leaves across the country.

Obsolete tech hits state-run thermal plants hard,"Patiala: Use of obsolete technology and ""biased"" power purchase agreement with the private sector has forced Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to shut down state-owned thermal plants./PSPCL has thermal plants at Ropar, Bathinda and Lehra Mohabbat and out of 14 units in these three thermal plants, only four are functioning right now./Whereas state-run thermal plants were set up in the 1970s using the technical support from Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), private thermal plants at Talwandi Sabo and Rajpura, built by the UK's MNC Vedanta Plc and construction giant Larsen Toubro, respectively, are based on Chinese technology and have been setup at a cost of around Rs 11,000 crore each. PSPCL chief engineer (thermal design) Amarjit Singh admitted that their thermal plants had obsolete technology. He, however, added that they had kept on updating the technology whenever possible. Sources said old thermal plants with low release of smoke caused pollution./Vedanta-owned Talwandi Sabo thermal plant's assistant general manager Vishal Aggarwal claimed that their plant was environment friendly. He said, ""The height of chimneys in our plant is 275 metres, which causes lesser air pollution.""/Sources said the state-owned thermal plants had chimneys that are 175m high, which was detrimental to environment. Those thermal plants also release ash in dry form while the new plants treat the ash by making a paste which was released in ash lakes, said sources./The second drawback, according to sources, was that PSPCL had to buy the entire quantum of power generated by the private sector thermal plants even as it was forced to shut down its owned plants. The Punjab Power Generation Policy was announced by the government in June 2010 to facilitate accelerated power generation capacity. It was decided to set up two new thermal plants at Talwandi Sabo and Rajpura. The government allegedly allowed large number of financial incentives to the private parties putting PSPCL to a huge loss./PSPCL chief engineer (power purchase and regulation) Balwant Arora refused to comment on the financial aspect, but admitted that PSPCL thermal power plants had now outlived their age. Padamjit Singh, patron of All India Power Engineers Federation, said despite being power surplus, over dependence on the private sector for power generation in Punjab was neither good for grid security, nor for consumers. He alleged that terms and conditions of Punjab Power Generation Policy, 2010, were dictated by the private sector generators and accepted in toto by the state government.

Let there be some official communication, then only we will be able to make any comment or prepare a plan for its implementation,"" said Rai on Thursday./Officials at CM's secretariat said Nitish has also asked the environment and forest department to prepare a plan to control noise pollution and check burning of plastic and solid waste in the open./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Too many exemptions to vehicles: CSE,"KOLKATA: The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has said that it was disappointed at the range of exemptions granted to different vehicle segments - especially two-wheelers and single women-driven cars. In a press release on Saturday, CSE said, ""This creates leakages in the programme that can compromise the overall effectiveness.""/According to CSE estimates, two-wheelers, because of their staggering numbers, contribute as much as 31 per cent of the total particulate load from vehicles. If this segment is left out and a sizeable number of cars are also allowed because of the exemption granted to single women drivers, the overall effectiveness of the programme will be compromised. It cannot act as an emergency measure to bring down the peak pollution level. CSE would like to urge the government to bring two-wheelers within the mandate of this programme./""The government must take into account the fact that once this programme is implemented and the number of personal vehicles is halved, road space will be freed for more improved operations of all buses, autos and taxis. The existing and the augmented bus numbers can do more trips and carry more people,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, CSE. ""Currently, the fleet utilization of available bus fleet in Delhi is very poor, and a large number of bus trips are missed because of congestion. This reduces the overall system efficiency of the fleet,"" she said./CSE said this programme will have to be enforced with seriousness of intent and to make a difference to the air quality of Delhi. ""This is an opportunity in the city to create and test out the plan for augmented public transport services that can be sustained even after the programme is over. This will help Delhi catalyse longer-term solutions to the mobility crisis that is worsening the air pollution impacts. Policy and public support is critical at a time when there is at least one death per hour due to air pollution-related diseases and every third child in the city has impaired lungs,"" Roy Chowdhury said./CSE recommended release of route-wise plan for augmented bus and metro services, reserve lanes for buses and improve feeder service to connect the last mile, publicizing routes and time tables for buses and feeders and introducing express services for NCR towns./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
IIT-Madras develops low-cost air purifier,"CHENNAI: With rising pollution levels, the time is not far off when an air purifier becomes an essential home appliance. And a team of researchers at IIT-Madras are ready with an affordable one./The team has developed a sensor-based indoor air purifier that promises to reduce the pollutant load including microbes in the air. Some companies have been marketing air purifiers that cost Rs15,000 upwards for a small room. Made out of commonly available low-cost materials like activated charcoal and ultra-violet light, the product from the IIT stable promises an affordable alternative./Chennai, which has an air quality index of around 55, is among the 'good' cities in terms of pollution; Delhi, with an index of 313, falls under the 'very poor' category./Air OK Technologies, a faculty startup launched under the IITM incubation cell will soon commercialise the device. Among the first domestic buyers could be people with asthma and such respiratory diseases. It is also designed to fit in any place that needs a sterilised environment such as a hospital or highly polluted areas like basement parking lots, buildings facing roads and dusty localities./The purifier works on a simple three-layer technology similar to that of a water purifier. A fan fitted at the bottom of a stainless steel cylindrical body sucks in the air after a sensor detects pollutants in the air. The air is transferred to a bag made of muslin fabric that acts as a pre-filter and removes large particles like dust./The second layer of filter is the activated charcoal produced by burning wood. The bag filled with a thick layer of charcoal in the bottom and to its sides absorbs the pollutants including chemicals and other microscopic particles. Researchers say substances in the air get stuck to the pores of the charcoal. ""The high surface area of the charcoal gives it lot of bonding places. So, the better the pores, the better the adsorption capacity,"" a research team member said./With a reduced level of pollutants, the air passes through the third filter. The filter has a ultraviolet light fixed above the activated charcoal layer that treats bacteria and viruses. The treated air is then let out. The system consumes 50 watts./Associate professor at the Environmental and Water Resources Engineering S M Shiva Nagendra said that air quality in rooms requires attention as much as the outdoor environment. ""We spend a lot of time indoors. While pollutants outdoors move around, in rooms they get accumulated and keep circulating,"" he said./Several studies have shown that vehicular emissions form 45% of urban air pollution. They are also a major contributor to indoor air pollutants including smoke, dust, aerosols and toxic chemical compounds like carbon monoxide. Pollution from vehicles coupled with emission from products like paints, burning fuel, construction rubble as well as allergens like pollen, molds and dander can affect indoor air quality./The purifier, which underwent an initial round of experiments in a controlled environment, showed significant reduction in pollutants present in the air. Burning of kerosene for less than 10 minutes along with other airborne molecules in a room measured up to 300 microgram per metric cube (0.001 milligrams per cubic metre). The use of purifier in the same environment showed has less than 20 to 30 microgram per metric cube particles in the filtered air. Several such experiments are being conducted to validate the device./The existing purifiers work on different mechanisms like filter cartridges made from fibre glass, foam and cotton fixed to heating or cooling systems, activated charcoal and UV radiation used separately or devices that uses high voltage to ionize airborne particles./The team is working to include additional features to the device that can distribute the treated air in 360 degrees, sensors that can automate the entire purifying process, so it can be energy saving./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Eight months on, Gurgaon firemen still await salary hike","GURGAON: Despite putting their lives in danger everytime there is a fire emergency in the city, the staff at the fire services feel unappreciated. Sources reveal, that the staff struggles with financial crises as neither their salaries are raised as per the orders of the district administration, nor do they get paid on time./The fire services in Gurgaon have a total staff of 157 employees. This includes 106 contract employees and 51 regular staff. Over a hundred of these are entitled to a raise as per the orders of deputy commissioner (DC) which were issued on May 19 this year. However, the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon still hasn't applied the new wage rate, reveals an RTI./""They were supposed to apply the new wages from April 1 of this year but they didn't give a raise to the employees of fire services despite the deputy commissioner issuing the orders for it,"" said Harinder Dhingra, the RTI activist./Every year, the employees of the fire services get a hike of 10 per cent. However, this year their increment was doubled and they were given a raise of 20 per cent. Under the new wages, a fireman would take home a salary of Rs 12,790 instead of Rs 10,658, where as the tender driver's salary increased to Rs 13,416 from Rs 11,180./But the same was never given to them and the worst sufferers are those who are employed under a contract./""Whenever we ask our contractor to increase our salaries, they tell us that same has to be issued from the MCG first,"" said a fireman who has been in the service for last eight years./""Imagine putting your life in danger everyday for a salary of Rs 10,000 a month. We battle fire and there is always a fear of a blast. While everyone is talking about air pollution, we actually inhale the smoke and soot. Then managing a family in a city like Gurgaon for such a small amount is so difficult,"" adds another employee at the fire services./Not only this, the restricted salary too is not issued on time. The staff complains that the salary is often released late by a week which puts them in an embarrassing situation./Deputy Commissioner T L Satyaprakash who now has an additional charge of MCG, says that he will now observe the performances of the firefighters before taking any action into the matter./""Appropriate action is certainly required but now I will monitor their performance for two months and then on the basis of that, the new pay will be applied,"" said the T L Satyaprakash, deputy commisioner, Gurgaon./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Vehicles sans PUCC to be penalized,"LUCKNOW: Vehicles causing pollution will have to pay the fine for being on the road. Regional Transport Office (RTO), Lucknow, will begin a drive against polluting vehicles on Friday./The move comes after high air pollution level was recorded in the city. All commercial and private vehicles will be checked and those that fail to produce Pollution Under Control Certificate (PUCC) will be issued a challan./""It's only after PUCC for a vehicle is produced that challan will be cleared,"" said RTO (enforcement), Lucknow, LK Mishra. A fine of Rs 1,000 will be slapped on polluting vehicles./Pollutants emitted by a petrol engine include oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur along with hydrocarbons and lead. It's the quantity of carbon monoxide (CO) in the smoke which is checked for PUCC. If the smoke has less than 3% CO concentration, the vehicle is considered non-polluting and issued a PUCC./In case of diesel vehicles, it is the smoke density which is checked for pollution. If density of the smoke emitted by the vehicle is less than 65 Hartridge Smoke Unit (HSU), the vehicle is certified as non-polluting. While '0' HSU means smoke is invisible, 100 HSU means smoke is thick and opaque./PUCC is issued by agencies authorised by the transport department. Lucknow has more than 100 such agencies, the location of which can be obtained from the RTO./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Forum chalks out plans for pollution-free Kudla,"MANGALURU: With major cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore facing alarming increase in vehicular congestion and vehicular air pollution, an organization has come out with suggestions to solve the emerging crisis./Anti-Pollution Drive (APD), a citizens' initiative, born in Namma Kudla is Kudla is deeply distressed to caution that Mangaluru too is headed in the same undesirable direction. Abdullah A Rehman, founder of organisation expressed that despite the widening and four-laning of all major roads, it is observed that there is no relief to the public and traffic congestion continues to be a problem we encounter every day. Mangaluru has one of the highest vehicle densities in this region. The density exceeds the carrying capacity of our infrastructure./""The resulting pollution caused by the exhaust of the increasing number of vehicles is translating into steady increase in health hazards. Asthma is observed to be increasing in children and respiratory problems among adults too is on the rise. If no immediate action is taken, Kudla too will soon have to face a Delhi like situation,"" according to Rehman./Anti-Pollution Drive (APD), is a registered Mangalore non-profit organization. It was established on October 2, 2014, to coincide with 'Swachh Bharat' campaign launched by the Prime Minister Modi./To curb increasing pollution APD has formulated following suggestions to solve the emerging crisis:/1. Introduce Car Pooling System: This is especially true for Derlakatte-Mangaluru sector where a number of doctors, students and others travel at regular timings. App-based carpooling system would be both practical and highly beneficial./2. College Transport System and Corporate Transport System should be streamlined to allow for more omni buses and car pooling. Government / RTO could give special incentives or recognitions for such institutions and companies./3. Public Transport - vehicle maintenance should be given priority. At present lot of smoke emitting vehicles are visible around the city./4. Verification of Certifying Agencies - It is observed that many vehicles emit high levels of smoke despite possessing mandatory pollution certificates. Though periodical pollution certification is mandatory, there is no mechanism for verifying the certificates and certification standards of the certifying agencies. Hence a verification mechanism is required./5. Establish Monitoring Station - The city lacks a Pollution Monitoring Station to gather and maintain data on the pollution within the city. The only station in the region is located at Baikampady. A city based station should be established to monitor pollution, analyze and report on the developments./6. Strict Action on Offenders - At present pollution seems to be a marginalized issue and the authorities are mild in dealing with pollution issues. Authorities should ensure stricter law enforcement against offending vehicles and their owners./7. Link to Smart City Project - Pollution control should be linked into the proposed Mangalore Smart City project and all plans and proposed developments should factor pollution control too./According to APD, Hampankatta, Balmatta, Jyothi Circe and Bunts hostels areas more polluted./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
1 in four of those tested have bad 'lung health',"NEW DELHI: Lung-function tests being conducted by Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) during the odd-even run have confirmed the worst fears of experts. Doctors say one of every four persons who took the tests in the past two days was found to have a 'compromised' lung function./Project head Dr Suneela Garg said most people who were tested had either obstructive or restrictive lung function, but they didn't perceive it as a disease. ""Hopefully, after these tests, they will attend to the medical needs arising out of the situation. We are referring some patients to pulmonologists also,"" she said./Dr Garg, a professor of community medicine at MAMC, said lung functions are being carried out by specialists stationed at 10 locations-Rajiv Chowk Metro station, ITO, Nehru Place, Jama Masjid, Vikas Marg, ISBT, Anand Vihar, Kashmere Gate, Kamla Nagar market near KMC gate, Delhi Haat and Shadipur Depot./On Sunday, day two of the tests, pulmonologists tested 91 people. Of these, 25 had obstructive/restrictive lung function. The lung-function tests of three persons were inconclusive. On Saturday, 55 people underwent the test; 16 were found to have compromised lung function./""These tests will go on till January 15. The aim of the study is to understand the impact of air pollution on the health and come up with guidelines on action required,"" said Dr Garg./Spirometry measures the amount (volume) or speed (flow) of air that can be inhaled and exhaled. For this test, one has to breathe into a mouthpiece attached to the device. The teams stationed at different locations comprise two doctors, two nurses, as many volunteers and a technician./""The results so far are similar to the reports published by various experts,"" said one of the doctors. A study conducted by the Chest Foundation of India, Pune, had revealed Indians have 30% lower lung function compared to Europeans. Things could get worse if immediate steps are not taken to curb vehicular emission, doctors had warned./Dr Randeep Guleria of AIIMS department of pulmonary medicine recently stated lung health in metros has deteriorated sharply. ""We are seeing a sharp increase in cases of chronic bronchitis, allergies, persistent cough and inflammation of airways in the past few years,"" he said./Guleria said when pollution levels peak, the number of emergency admissions for respiratory problems and heart attack increases sharply./According to the 2010 global burden of disease report, outdoor air pollution caused more than 6.2 lakh premature deaths in India and nearly 18 million healthy years of life were lost that year./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Gurgaon pollution dips on Day 1,"GURGAON: There was a considerable decrease in Gurgaon's air pollution level on the first day of the odd-even scheme in Delhi. In fact, pollution levels registered a decline of 15 to 42% on three parameters as compared to last Sunday./According to Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) figures, the level of PM 2.5 decreased by about 15% on Friday, while the levels of carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide had gone down by 21% and 42%, respectively, as compared to the levels recorded at the same time on December 27./Generally, the city records a slight decrease in PM 2.5 and carbon monoxide levels over the weekend. PM 2.5 remains 10 to 15 notches below as compared to weekdays. However, on Friday, the level of PM 2.5 remained nearly 25 notches below./The level of oxides of nitrogen also increased considerably from 8.45 on December 27 to 9.68 on January 1. However, HSPCB officials said the car rationing experiment had no bearing on the city's air pollution level, which depends on several factors, including density of smog in atmosphere, sunlight and wind speed./""Even though the air circulates in large expanse of land, the impact of the odd-even formula in Delhi was not very significant for Gurgaon. According to our estimates, the impact can't be more than 2 to 3%. The low level of air pollution depends on many factors,"" said an official of HSPCB./But experts feel that a lot of factors, including the odd-even scheme, have contributed to this. ""Every year, the city witnesses the impact of paddy burning in far-off fields of Haryana and Punjab as the wind circulates from one state to the other. Delhi is an adjoining city and thus it largely impacts the presence of pollutants in the city's air. The wind speed is also low these days, which doesn't let the wind to circulate too far,"" said Debjani Chowdhury, a city-based environmentalist.She added, ""I, therefore, feel that Delhi's odd-even scheme has made a positive impact in bringing down the city's air pollution level.""Some experts also give credit to the ban on the registration of diesel vehicles from December 26.""Even though diesel vehicles are still plying on roads, many are switching over to CNG engines. Diesel vehicles are polluting vehicles. Smoke emitted by the diesel vehicles is responsible for higher level of PM 2.5 in air. I think the district administration in the city should also be given credit for implementing the ban properly. However, a lot of things still need to be done,"" said Niranjan Raje, a member of Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA)./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Bad air: Virus takes toll on Delhi kids,"New Delhi: A viral infection, frequently mistaken for a bacterial disease and worsened by pollution, is taking a toll of children in Delhi. It is caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is like any other influenza virus but can be more serious for children./""RSV infection is common in winter. But this year the increase in its incidence is appreciably high,"" said Dr Anil Sachdev, senior consultant, department of paediatric intensive care and pulmonology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. The hospital recently conducted a study of children reporting respiratory illnesses and found that among the 220 patients analysed, 57 were RSV-positive. The study also found that 20 of 29 infants who required ICU care for respiratory problems were RSV-positive./Very often, the symptoms are similar to those of bacterial infection. But Sachdev cautions, ""In RSV, antibiotics should not to be given. Instead, anti-virals have to be administered for speedy recovery.""/Experts say that in around a quarter of the cases involving infants, the virus travels deep into the lungs and causes small airways to fill up with thick mucus and dead cells. This constricts airways and causes difficulty in breathing./High levels of pollution can worsen the condition of RSV patients. Dr Chand Wattal, chairperson of the department of microbiology at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, explained that this was because ""the toxins present in the air bring down the body's capacity to fight infection""./A 2013 report in the Italian Journal of Pediatrics on the correlation between RSV infection in infants and meteorological factors and air pollutants had suggested that reduction of air pollution in urban areas could lead to an improvement in infant morbidity. It said protection from pollution could reduce respiratory symptoms and an individual's susceptibility to respiratory infection./Paediatricians say that because RSV is transmitted in the same way as other respiratory viruses, minimising a child's exposure to crowded places is important. ""One should avoid taking infants to malls and ensure hygiene at all times,"" said Sachdev, adding, ""For the majority of kids with relatively mild symptoms, the best treatment is symptomatic care. That means staying home, keep the nose clean and encouraging fluid intake."" However, those with severe symptoms such as rapid or laboured breathing, decreased fluid intake and extreme irritability could need hospitalisation./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Yet a village woman who cooks over a dung-fuelled chulha for several hours a day could be more exposed to hazardous pollutants than a Delhi office worker./This distinction between ambient pollution levels and individual exposure lies at the heart of a new report from a Union health ministry committee that---correcting a historical focus on urban air pollution---highlights the importance of tackling pollution from the burning of dung and wood in village chulhas across India./The report, made available on the health ministry's website this week, calls for an integrated approach to air pollution that focuses on ""reducing exposures not emissions""./""All pollution is bad but, with the intention of eventually taking care of all of it, where do you focus your efforts first?"" said Ambuj Sagar, committee co-chair and Vipula and Mahesh Chaturvedi Professor of Policy Studies at the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi. ""From a health standpoint, you prioritize reduction in areas and sources that most affect people directly.""/Top of the committee's list: reducing household air pollution from cooking with biomass because the proximity to humans, especially women and children, makes stove smoke most harmful--- next only to cigarette smoking, in fact./Household cooking is ""probably the largest single source of exposure in the country, although only one of many contributors to ambient air pollution,"" the report said. Most rural households in India-an estimated 780 million people---continue to rely on wood, dung and other biomass for cooking, while a good percentage of urban households also use non-LPG stoves./Next on the committee's priority list: pollution from vehicles, garbage burning, and diesel generator sets---all micro or local sources of pollution. Then comes road and construction dust, followed by brick kilns, local industries, and then power plants and other large industries./Conventionally, environmental policy has focused on large-scale sources of ambient pollution. Road dust, for example, is thought to be a bigger source of pollution in Delhi than vehicles./""The standard practice of ranking pollution sources on the basis of their contribution to ambient emissions ... may be creating distortions in their apparent relative importance from the health standpoint, although perhaps adequate for other purposes - visibility, for example,"" the report says./""Evaluation by exposure will not only re-order the ranking of major outdoor emission sources but will reveal an entirely different landscape of sources; those that may significantly affect exposure without appreciably affecting ambient concentration.""/Much more data and studies are needed to understand pollution patterns, Sagar said. Monitoring of air pollution is still largely confined to cities, the report notes, and monitors tend to be on rooftops ""where people hardly ever are""./And in some ways, tackling the cooking or driving habits of millions of people can be as or more complicated as tackling single-point sources like factories, Sagar admitted./To reduce household pollution, the report advocates expanding power and gas coverage as well as innovating cleaner stoves and running public health campaigns. Tackling air pollution should be part of the Swachh Bharat campaign, the committee said, and clean cooking stoves given as much importance as toilets./Emissions from cooking with biomass also contribute a quarter of ambient PM2.5 levels in the country, the report notes. ""Exposure to air pollution, be it ambient or household, is part of a continuum, and reinforces the need for an integrated approach towards mitigation and harm reduction.""/Kirk Smith, a leading air pollution expert and the professor of global environment health at the University of California at Berkeley, described committee's focus on exposure management as well as on looking at indoor and outdoor air pollution together, as ""pioneering""./""The new approach is facilitated by new technologies,"" he said, ""We have ways to monitor individual pollution exposure that we didn't have before.""/This is also the first time any country's health ministry is taking up air pollution, he noted, as the issue is usually handled by environment ministries./The steering committee on air pollution and health related issues was set up in January 2014 to frame an action plan to mitigate the health effects of indoor and outdoor air pollution. The committee drew on experts across fields./Exposure to fine particulates known as PM2.5 from both ambient pollution and household pollution is the single largest risk factor for disease in India, according to the World Health Organisation's Global Burden of Disease report./Air pollution leads not only to respiratory illness but has also been linked to heart disease, stroke, cataracts and lung cancer. ""Just as with tobacco smoking, which produces the same set of impacts, air pollution needs now to be considered within public health programs concerning both non- communicable and communicable diseases,"" the report says./While most of the recommendations are for other ministries, ""we hope the health ministry can take the lead in coordinating action,"" Sagar said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Chanda stockist burn snack packets in open, go scot-free","CHANDRAPUR: While the police and district administration are striving hard to garner public support for no vehicle day drive to curb pollution in the city, a stockist of packaged snacks played spoilsport by burning bulk of expired stock in open, and thus, adding to the already high pollution levels in Chandrapur./Surprisingly, both the civic administration and MPCB did nothing to stop the blatant violation. After environmentalists raised the issue, both Chandrapur Municipal Corporation (CMC) and MPCB initiated action against the violator./The stockist Balaji Sweet Center wanted to dispose of dated stock from his godown in Shriram ward in the heart of the city on Friday afternoon.

"Black carbon level in air down 50% since Dec 31, study shows","Gurgaon: A week into the odd-even experiment, the levels of black carbon in the air have decreased by almost 50% according to a study by Indian Aerosol Science and Technology Association and students of Amity University, Gurgaon./The study shows that the mass concentration of black carbon - carbon particles released by incomplete combustion of fuel - reduced from 15 micrograms per cubic metre on December 31 to 7.6 micrograms per cubic metre on January 5. The test was conducted at the monitoring station on the university campus in Manesar./""Vehicles are a major source of black carbon after wood burning. Stranded vehicles, in particular, are responsible for emitting black carbon. We have noticed that due to reduction in traffic jams during the odd-even scheme, the level of unburnt carbon in the atmosphere has come down,"" said Dr P C S Devara, president of Indian Aerosol Science and Technology Association, who mentored the students during the study./According to the United Nations Environment Programme, black carbon is a sooty substance, which is a solid component of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). It has severe health impacts, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and also contributes to climate change. Vehicles are responsible for nearly 20% of black carbon emissions globally, and diesel vehicles, in particular, are a major contributor to emissions./Talking about the mechanism used for the study, Munshi Pavel Alam, a student of BSc (Earth Sciences) said, ""We used data from the air monitoring system installed on our campus in Manesar and data provided by SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research) of the ministry of earth sciences. The team comprising two mentors and three students used a Seven Beam Aethalometer (instrument to measure suspended particles) to measure the concentration of black carbon and an aerodynamic particle sizer to measure PM levels.""/The study brought out the correlation between the drop in time required to cover a particular distance during the odd-even scheme and the reduction in the consumption of fuel, which reportedly led to the decline in the concentration of black carbon in the air./""For instance, a distance of 70km, which was earlier covered in more than two hours, can now be covered in just over an hour. This directly relates to approximately 30% reduction in fuel consumption for the same distance travelled on odd-even days, which led to reduction in black carbon in the atmosphere,"" Alam said./Doctors in the city said the drop in levels of black carbon is a good sign and have welcomed the news, saying that black carbon can be carcinogenic./""Black carbon particle is one of the main components of PM 2.5. Reduction in their concentration is definitely a good sign. PM 2.5 are extremely small particles that go straight to the lungs and can cause severe respiratory diseases. Even if there is a decrease in only one component of particulate matter, it should be seen as an achievement.

10% of Ghaziabad's power supply comes from diesel gensets,"Noida/Ghaziabad: The summer of 2015 was a hard time for residents of Noida and Ghaziabad with unscheduled power cuts forcing them to rely on smoke belching diesel generators. Even by the most conservative estimates, at least a tenth of the total load is borne by generators in Ghaziabad, whereas in Noida the steep power backup costs residents had to pay shows a different picture to the official 'no power cut zone' line./The next summer is likely to be worse, but residents may not have to worry about outages if administrations of the two cities keep their word. After formulating an action plan on tackling pollution caused by vehicles, the two cities have to now turn their attention to reducing the dependence on power backup. Diesel generators are a major source of air pollution and release particulate matter, but till now, there has been no collection of data to measure how much they contribute./Although Noida claims that there is no shortfall in power supply, frequent power rostering was observed over the past year due to transmission network developing snags on a frequent basis. Ghaziabad was hit even worse, with residents complaining of six-eight hour power cuts. Officials, however, maintain that the shortage was only 50MW out of a total demand of 500MW./In such a situation, a great deal of the power load in the two cities is borne by generators. According to A senior official of the Ghaziabad Development Authority said more than 150 societies in the trans-Hindon area have generators with a capacity of 200-500 kVA, with most of them having more than one. In addition, all government offices, educational institutions and private quarters have their own generators./A pollution study for the Central Pollution Control Board in 2013 had found that diesel generators contribute 6% of PM 2.5 particles and 10% of PM 10 particles in Delhi and its neighbouring cities./But the authorities are confident of meeting all power needs, which are expected to further rise this summer. ""We will be meeting all the power demand and requirement of Noida for 2016 and consumers will not have to depend on power backups or gensets,"" said Mukul Singhal, superintending engineer Paschimanchal Vidyut Viteran Nigam Limited (PVVNL)./Singhal said that the average power demand in Noida is expected to be around 970MW, up from 900MW in 2015.This will be met by the four new substations, with a total capacity of 880kV, that are under construction in Noida. ""We have asked for their possession by March 2016 before the summer season beginsOnce these substations are handed over, we'll face no outages in Noida"" said Singhal/In Ghaziabad too, officials said they have the infrastructure in place to meet the power demand, which is expected to rise to 600MW from 500MW this year. Officials said the government is concerned about increasing air pollution and is focusing on augmenting infrastructure here./Atulesh Yadav, UPPCB's regional officer for Gautam Budh Nagar, said the first step to curbing pollution caused by diesel generators has already been taken following the 2013 National Green Tribunal order to phase out old generators used by industries./""Gensets are mostly used by all industries and commercial units in Noida and as per UPPCB norms; they have to be in acoustic enclosures (under pollution norms of noise and emission). All gensets in GB Nagar are under acoustic enclosures. Currently 648 units in GB Nagar are using acoustic enclosed gensets,"" said Yadav./This does not include the domestic category of generators as according to Yadav, they cannot be inventoried./There is still a long way to go as there is little reliable data collection to monitor pollution caused by power backup.

'Stone flower' wilting under pollution,"Pune: A type of lichen named Usnea ghattensis, found in the northern areas of the Western Ghats particularly in the vicinity of Mahabaleshwar, could well be the source of the next wonder drug. Under laboratory conditions, its extract has shown anti-oxidant and anti-microbial properties apart from a possible remedy for liver diseases./Usnea ghattensis is one among 180 species of lichens that are found exclusively in the Western Ghats and nowhere else in the world. The region is rich in lichen diversity with nearly 1150 species found here, said Sanjeeva Nayaka, principal scientist at the CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute's Lichenology lab division./Lichens are very important in traditional medicinal practices like Ayurveda and tribal medicine. There are about a thousand secondary metabolites, or chemicals, produced in lichen. Of these, about 950 chemicals are not found in any other group of living organisms. With such a wide chemistry in their internal system, lichens can be highly useful in medicine, he said./Nayaka, who has been studying lichens for over 15 years, explained that the southern Western Ghats that receive heavy rainfall and have more evergreen forests are also the centers of the highest diversity of lichens in the region. In studies conducted in the Nilgiri Biosphere reserve, about 770 species of lichen were found, he pointed out./Despite this vast diversity, lichens found in the Western Ghats face several threats, including from rising pollution levels with increasing urbanization./""Lichens are particularly sensitive to air pollution for several reasons. Firstly, they do not have any protective layer, such as the wax-like coating on plants' leaves. Moreover, lichens have root-like structures that are used to cling to the surface they grow on. However, they do not absorb water or nutrients through these roots,"" Nayaka explained./Lichens are hygroscopic in nature. The fungal part of the symbiotic association, which is responsible for supplying nutrients and water to the algal part, directly absorbs it from the atmosphere. Thereby, if the atmosphere is polluted, then pollutants are also absorbed. The alga that dwells inside the fungi is usually highly sensitive to pollutants and dies. The lichen is then left incapable of producing its own food. Eventually, the entire lichen body withers, he said./The changing lichen diversity of a certain area, with pollution-sensitive species gradually vanishing, can be a useful tool in gauging air pollution in a certain area. Even lichens that are not sensitive to air pollutants can be very useful in this regard since pollutants tend to accumulate in them and lab experiments can reveal the amount of pollution in a certain area, Nayaka said./""Besides indicating pollution levels, this group of symbiotic organisms also has other uses. Certain kinds of lichens, particularly the species in the Parmelioid group, are used as a spice in Indian cuisine. The lichen is locally known as 'dagad phool' that literally translates into ""stone flower,"" he added./Although local names of lichens in most parts of India usually invoke a similar image and many lichens are known to grow on rocky surfaces, they are not restricted to rocks. They are also found growing on the bark of trees and on the soil, Nayaka said./With several uses for lichens, overexploitation remains a major threat. Parmotrema chinense, a medicinally usefully lichen that is found in many parts of the world including Tamil Nadu, nearly became locally extinct due to over-exploitation in India, he mentioned./Over-exploitation of lichens affects them to such an extent because their rate of growth and regeneration is slow. Lichens grow merely a few millimetres or centimetres each year. If lichen from the forests is removed in large quantity, its rate of renewal may not be fast enough, Nayaka added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
