Homes more polluted than roads: Dr Salvi,"Nagpur: A mosquito repellent coil may give us a feeling of safety from many diseases. Similarly, we derive a feeling of great satisfaction when we light a incense (dhoop) stick while praying to God. But very few of us know that these two are the biggest sources of indoor pollution that can weaken lungs to an extent that may lead to various chronic diseases. /Research has shown that indoor pollution is much more harming and responsible for lung diseases than outdoor pollution.Dr Sundeep Salvi, director of Chest Research Foundation from Pune, said that ""Our homes are the biggest source of air pollution. Inhaling smoke from a mosquito repellent is like inhaling 100 cigarettes. Inhaling smoke from incense sticks is like inhaling ten times more polluted air. And exposure to snake tablet during Diwali is like inhaling three times more polluted air than dhoop stick. Unfortunately, neither people know about the extent of damage that these exposures can lead to in a person nor are the doctors aware of the severity of the impact of these indoor sources of pollution. Also, exposure to biomass-based fuels like a chullah is more dangerous than tobacco.""Dr Salvi was in the city to deliver a talk at NKP Salve Institute of Medical Sciences (NKPSIMS) and Lata Mangeshkar Hospital (LMH) titled 'The air we breathe: It's impact on our health', organized by the department of respiratory medicine at NKPSIMS.A recent study published in Chest Journal in March this year has shown that the closed-door pollution exposes a person to particulate matter of about 2,200 microgram/cubic metre whereas the safety limit is just 50. About 60% of population uses mosquito coils. Also, those who use liquid vaporizers are also exposed to highly toxic gaseous pollutant. Incense sticks of 4cm causes an exposure of 20,000 microgram/cubic metre. A research study in 50 temple priests in Pune showed that about 25% of them suffered from asthma and COPD of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. Another study showed that snake tablet releases 60,000 microgram/cubic metre of pollution. 70% of people in rural areas are exposed to biomass burning through chullah. ""Though the exposure time in all these cases is less, the intensity of exposure is dangerous. It is not surprising that India is considered as one of the most polluted countries in the world and Indians are known for less than 35% of lung capacity than the Caucasian population as they are exposed to both indoor and outdoor forms of severe pollution,"" said Dr Salvi.Dr Anil Sontakke, associate professor, Dr BO Tayde, professor and head of respiratory medicine and Dr Kajal Mitra, NKPSIMS dean, also spoke on the occasion. Dr Rajesh Swarnakar chaired the talk.InfoGhastly after-effects* Exposure to pollution starts in an individual much before birth. Babies born to women with exposure to both indoor and outdoor pollution are smaller in size and weight and are likely to die early* A child exposed to pollution has poor lung growth, weak lungs all his life and its lung function never touches the peak* Respiratory tract infections, asthma, COPD and lung cancer are the most common repercussions of compromised lungs/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"War on pollution begins, but only small battles won","Air pollution was a major talking point the whole of 2016. It kept both the Centre and the Delhi government on their toes, but couldn't move them enough to look for long-term solutions. But there were short-term measures. Such as the odd-even scheme, which was introduced in two phases-from January 1-15, and again from April 15-30. The road rationing, though, got a mixed verdict. /Many environmental experts believed it managed to bring down emissions because of fewer cars on the road and shorter stoppage times; conversely, concerns were raised about the efficacy of the system to curb air pollution when two-wheelers-that accounted for a third of vehicular emissions-were exempted.As November kicked in, both the Delhi government and the Centre had to deploy emergency measures when the capital witnessed the worst smog in its history. On November 5 and 6, the air quality index maxed out with PM 2.5 levels shooting up about 13 times the safe limit. The Delhi government closed down schools for three days, halted all constructions, shut down the Badarpur power plant and even sprinkled water on roads to keep dust down. It acknowledged that it was an emergency.The Centre also acknowledged that bad air posed a serious health threat. The Union health ministry included chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder under the non-communicable disease programme. On SC's prodding, CPCB submitted a ""graded response action plan"", detailing actions to be taken when air quality deteriorates. SC approved it and directed the environment ministry to notify it. CSE's Anumita Roy Chowdhury said, ""Air pollution got more traction this year. Centre should immediately enforce the graded response action plan. This year has been mostly about emergency response to smog. Public transport upgrade has been a non-starter, and there is no move on long-term policies either."" Making Delhi walking and cycling friendly was also more talk than action, as was the Centre's 42-point action plan for the satellite cities. But the Centre notified BS VI norms, while the SC imposed a 1% cess on diesel vehicles beyond 2,000 cc and mandated RFID tags for trucks entering the capital./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution level in Kolkata among country's highest,"KOLKATA: New Delhi may be reeling under severe air pollution, but Kolkata has not only touched the country's capital city but have also surpassed the city quite a few days in terms of air pollution.A joint study by the British Deputy High Commission, UKAID and Kolkata Municipal Corporation that was released last year had found that the city was already the fifth highest among major cities in the country emitting 14.8 million tons of Green House Gas (GHG) and also the second highest contributor in terms of per capita CO2 emission, producing 3.29 tonnes of CO2 per capita. The major sources of air pollution include automobile exhausts which is about 50%, industrial emissions that is almost 48% and the rest 2% from cooking. The findings have been mentioned in details in the book 'Roadmap For Low Carbon And Climate Resilient Kolkata'. It was during the visit of the former UK Prime Minister David Cameron in the city on November 14, 2013 that the UK government had signed a MOU with KMC on low carbon and climate resilient Kolkata.The study also finds that around 70% of the city's 15 million inhabitants suffer from some form of respiratory problems caused by air pollution. /The study specially mentioned that vector borne diseases like malaria and dengue as well as respiratory diseases will rise in the city due to the increasing pollution level. This proved to be true this year, with more than 50 persons have died from dengue and several thousand others affected.The study had come up with proposals as to how to combat and control the increasing air pollution in the city. It had suggested that KMC authorities should work together with the relevant state government departments to establish and enforce auto fuel quality guidelines and emission standards to lower pollution. According to former chief environment law officer Biswajit Mukherjee, a plan should be chalked out to control air pollution. ""There was a plan discussed way back in 2011 to do something to prevent air pollution caused by firecrackers but it did not materialise. The issue should be looked into seriously now,"" he said.State government officials said that the government has taken up a Green Cities mission stressing on developing low carbon urban township areas with special focus on environment. The plan is to stress on using pollution free solar power, battery and electric run vehicles and LED lights to have a low carbon output. State urban development and municipal affairs minister Firhad Hakim recently held a meeting with all municipal bodies of the state by the end of this month to discuss on coming up with measures to control air pollution./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution inside zoo as high as at industrial zones,"Hyderabad: It isn't just the toxic water seeping in from the adjacent Mir Alam Tank that is posing a threat to the lives of animals inside the Nehru Zoological Park. Also making it difficult for them to breathe is the densely-polluted air within the premises that is getting worse every passing day.Air pollution levels inside the Zoo Park are dangerously high, according to data available with the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB). Classified as a 'sensitive' zone with a permissible Air Quality Index (AQI) of under 100, the zoo recorded an AQI of 241 in November last year. According to standards set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), an AQI between 201 and 300 is classified as 'poor' and can cause ""breathing discomfort to people upon prolonged exposure"". The pollution levels are worse than those recorded at some of Hyderabad's industrial zones.Take for instance its fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) level. /While the permissible limit for this is 60 \xB5g/m3, in November, the zoo recorded a PM 2.5 level as high as 103.6 \xB5g/m3. The PM 10 content too stood only second to that recorded at Pashamylaram, an industrial belt in the city outskirts), which was 194 \xB5g/m3. At the zoo, the count was 177 \xB5g/m3. Wildlife activists sound a word of caution. Pointing out how 'Anthracosis', a lung disease and an indicator of air pollution, has claimed many lives at the zoo in the past, Imran Siddique said, ""Anthracosis is seen when there is a high carbon presence in the lungs and many animals at the zoo fell prey to this disease around six years ago. Poor air quality can also cause breathing difficulties in animals and trigger hormonal changes which in turn affects their breeding pattern. It can also cause behavioural problems with animals showing symptoms such as pacing to and fro and drooping heads."" Officials made light of the issue. While blaming the location of the zoo for the rising pollution levels, they said that it wasn't a threat to animals. ""In 2016, five animals died due to water pollution. But no air pollution related illness has been detected among zoo animals so far,"" said a zoo official. According to in-house veterinarian, Abdul Hakim, authorities have been taking all precautions to keep animals safe. ""The pollution levels are such because the zoo is located right in the heart of the city. We are taking preventive measures and following protocol to ensure that the animals are protected. These include vaccination drives and ensuring access to protected water,"" he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Research links living near major roads to dementia,"NEW DELHI: A massive new study has found correlation between dementia and living near major roads. Over a 10-year period, researchers from Public Health Ontario looked at 6.6 million people staying at different distances from major roads. They found that those staying as close as 50 meters to a major road showed a 7 per cent higher risk of developing dementia, possibly due to a combination of air and noise pollution.The observational study is published in The Lancet. However, it found no link between traffic exposure and Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis.The study estimated that up to one in 10 (7-11%) cases of dementia among those who live within 50 metres of a major road could be attributed to traffic exposure.Previous research has suggested that air pollution and traffic noise may contribute to neurodegeneration, with one study finding that living near a road was associated with reduced white matter and lower cognition. /However, the paper in The Lancet is the first to investigate the link between living close to heavy traffic and the onset of major neurodegenerative diseases.The researchers tracked all adults aged between 20 and 85 living in Ontario, Canada - approximately 6.6 million people - for over a decade from 2001 to 2012. They used postcodes to determine how close people lived to a road and analysed medical records to see if they went on to develop dementia, Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis.Almost all people (95%) in the study lived within one kilometre of a major road and half lived within 200 metres of one. Over the study period, more than 243000 people developed dementia, 31500 people developed Parkinson's disease and 9250 people developed multiple sclerosis.While there was no association between living near a road and Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis, dementia was more common the closer people lived to busy roads. The risk of developing dementia reduced as people lived further away from a main road - with a 7% higher risk in developing dementia among those living within 50 metres, a 4% higher risk at 50-100 metres, a 2% higher risk at 101-200 metres and no increase in risk in those living more than 200 metres away.The researchers also found that long-term exposure to two common pollutants (nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter) was associated with dementia but this did not account for the full effect, meaning other factors are also likely to be involved. These could include other air pollutants or noise from traffic.""Despite the growing impact of these diseases, little is known about their causes and prevention,"" said lead author Dr Hong Chen, Public Health Ontario, Canada. ""Our study suggests that busy roads could be a source of environmental stressors that could give rise to the onset of dementia. Increasing population growth and urbanisation has placed many people close to heavy traffic, and with widespread exposure to traffic and growing rates of dementia, even a modest effect from near-road exposure could pose a large public health burden. More research to understand this link is needed, particularly into the effects of different aspects of traffic, such as air pollutants and noise.""The study estimated air pollution exposure based on postcode, so does not account for each individual's exposure. Because the study is observational it cannot establish causality, but the study was designed to control for socioeconomic status, education levels, BMI and smoking meaning the link is unlikely to be explained by these factors./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Travelling in crowded metro every day? Here's what could be happening to your body,"Daily metro travel is an ordeal of sorts. We hang on to the grab handles, in an endless pursuit of a seat. And as soon as we see a miniscule of the bench peeping through the thighs of two people, we never hesitate to ask, “Can you please shift?” No one minds, or better, no one should mind. We all have the same plight; no one wants to reach office or home with aching backs and legs, a stressed out temperament and a tired mind./Almost 3 million passengers travel every day in Delhi metro. Have you given a thought to this that the daily travel you do mindlessly as part of your routine can be impacting your health in at least three ways?/We talked to three medical experts from Max Hospital, Saket, who helped us understand what these crowded metro rides, can be costing us./The Ortho Damage/While we travel long hours in metro standing our way to our offices, we harm our legs and back the most, says Dr Rajesh Bawari, Sr Consultant, Orthopaedics, Max Hospital, Saket. But the damage happens when we do not mind our postures. Wrong postures can include bending more on one side, carrying heavy bags on our back, bending our necks to fiddle with our phones, wearing heels every day, and so many more that stresses one particular organ of our body more than the others, says Dr Rajesh./Such wrongful habits can manifest themselves in the following ways:/- Pain in neck and back (Cervical Spondylosis)/- Tearing away of spinal disks (Lumbar spondylosis)/- Nerve related issues/- Varicose veins/- Muscle soreness/- Pain in heels and bottom of foot (Plantar fasciitis)/- Painful tender spots on bones/Some simple changes can help lessen the damage. Dr Rajesh says that there are two ways you can spend your time while travelling in metro – one is constructive, the other destructive. While you may or may not get a seat, there are certain things that you should not do and certain things you can do instead that can help you prevent the damage, such as follows:/- While you are standing, do not just stand. Keep moving your feet up and down to avoid pulling blood in your lower legs./- Try standing in a way that you put equal pressure on your big toes, little toes and heels./- Make your travel a double edged sword. Keep tightening your core muscles while you are travelling./- Rest your back against a pillar or metro wall./- Avoid wearing heels everyday. If at all you want to wear them, prefer platform heels./There are certain things that you can do when you reach home. These include:/- Resting your feet on a level above your body, such as keeping them on two pillows while you lie down. This will better the blood circulation in your feet./- Soak your feet in warm water with salt in it./The Mental Fatigue/""People develop a perpetual internal anger on overcrowded trains which they cannot easily displace,"" said Professor Cary Cooper, a psychologist at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology./Overcrowded metros can cause stress much before people reach office and even after they reach their homes back. Travelling in metros can lead to a sense of claustrophobia, especially when you are travelling in underground metro, says Dr Sameer Malhotra, Director, Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences, Max Hospital, Saket. He explains the mental impact of metro travelling that can be put down as two ways:/Drop in serotonin levels: Serotonin is a brain chemical that can have a profound impact on your mood. Dr Sameer says that travelling daily in overcrowded metros can lead to a drop in the level of serotonin in your body making you feel pessimistic, worried and delving into the negative of ‘what ifs’./Cattle truck syndrome: This basically refers to the stress induced by a tiresome daily metro travelling that is crowded like a cattle truck. It can translate into anxiety symptoms that can make one feel that escape from a difficult situation is impossible. Unexpected halting of trains can lead to undue stress particularly when one has deadlines to meet./On the flip side of this, if metro is less crowded, a positive environment can reduce stress levels. But for most office goers, this hardly happens as they travel for the much traditional 9 to 5 shifts./To prevent these, you can do the following:/- Utilize your time well and do what you like. Read a book, watch a video, listen to music, but all this while, make sure that you do not harm your body. Keep your standing posture correct and do not keep your neck bent for too long./- Deep breathe 108 times while you are onboard./- Press these points on your neck and shoulder that help you relieve stress. Read them here ./- De-stress yourself when you reach your office/home by having your cup of coffee or tea or indulging in an activity that relaxes you./The Cardio Risk/Dr Viveka Kumar, Director, Cath Lab, Max Hospital, Saket, says that metro travelling can have both positive as well negative impacts on one’s heart health. On the healthier side is that when one travels by metro, he is exposed to less toxins and does not have to suffer the national capital’s much infamous air pollution./On the negative side of metro travelling impact on heart, Dr Viveka says, are majorly two kinds of risks. These are:/Hypertension: Most office goers are running behindhand almost every day. The unpunctual Delhiites have deadlines to meet and they start swearing against the metro services even for a few minutes’ delay. Such situations lead to stress and in turn can pump up one’s blood pressure./On the flip side, if one has not had a proper meal or is under hydrated before boarding a metro, one’s blood pressure could dip due to blood pooling in one’s legs due to standing. Low blood pressure can make people collapse. Dr Viveka said that he comes across one to two such cases of a collapse in metro every week./Contracting communicable diseases: Dr Viveka said that travelling in metro exposes one to infected droplets of bacteria that other people can be releasing and can lead to air borne diseases such as chest infections and tuberculosis. You also may become more prone to seasonal allergies, common cold and cough and viral fever./To prevent these, Dr Viveka gives the following advices:/- Before boarding a metro, make sure that you are well hydrated and not on an empty stomach./- Wash your hands and face every time you de-board a metro. Make it the first thing you do when you reach your office or home./- If you cannot wash them immediately, use sanitizers for your hands./- Do not repeat the clothes you wear once during a metro ride without washing them./- Take a bath in the evening when you reach back home after a day spent in a crowded metro./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"As mercury dips after rain, farmers cheer","RUDRAPUR: Mercury dipped 3-4 degrees Celsius after rain lashed Udham Singh Nagar district Saturday morning, bringing cheers to the farmers sowing Rabi crop. Rain started lashing the district, which otherwise remained dry thus far, early in the morning, and by evening, the meteorological department recoded a rainfall of 8.2 mm and wind speed of 10 kmph./This brought the maximum temperature down by 3 degrees, which settled at 14; and the minimum tumbled to 6 degrees, four notches down. The trend is likely to continue for the next three days, as the Met has predicted rain for the next 24 hours and more./According to Met, today’s rain was triggered by two successive western disturbances affecting Jammu and Kashmir, which have also induced a cyclonic circulation over northern India and is moving eastwards gradually. As a result of disturbances, intermittent rains have lashed the plains as well./Weather expert Anil Hafiz told TOI, “The rain will continue for the next 24 hours, leading to drop in day temperature on Sunday. Thereafter, the rain will cease as the disturbances will move away from the region and will pave way to cold northwesterly wind to sweep Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and hilly areas of Uttarakhand that received heavy snow. As a result, both day and night temperatures will start falling significantly after January 9.”/“We can expect mercury to be lowest between January 10 and 12 degrees, while the night temperature may settle below 5,” said Hafiz, adding that terai is likely to reel under severe winter chill next week, which could be marked as the coldest period of this winter./Normally, the region receives at least 2-3 rain spells between November and December./District agriculture officer (DAO) P K Singh said, “The rainfall will boost the rabi crop (also known as winter crops), which include wheat, barley, mustard, sesame and peas. Water-intensive sugarcane, the main cash crop in the district, which were sown in December, are at present in vegetative or pre-flowering stage. Watering at this point of time is very good for them, particularly drizzling that let soil to absorb maximum water,” said Singh, adding that the rain is good for those farmers who do not have irrigation facilities./Dr M K Tiwari, senior physician at the district hospital, however, said, “The rain will drastically reduce diseases like flu, viral infections, nasal and throat allergies, dry cough and skin allergies. Many diseases will disappear with the first rainfall of the winter. However, after the rain, the mercury will go down, and thus, I will suggest mothers to keep their kids, especially newborn, warm and to make proper heating arrangements in their rooms.”/The dry spell had led to increase in air pollution, causing chest and throat infections; however, the rain would wash away dust particles and make the weather pleasant, he added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"You aren't alone Delhi, all 22 NCR districts are choking","NEW DELHI: New air pollution data derived from satellite imagery suggests that the severe levels of particulate matter (PM2.5, or respirable pollutants) seen in Delhi are also found throughout the 22 districts of the National Capital Region (NCR). These findings raise alarm about potentially serious adverse effects on the health and livelihoods of NCR residents outside of Delhi and underline the importance of a coordinated response to pollution across NCR. Till now the focus has been on the pernicious effects of pollution in the major urban centres, but the new data will help shine the light on exposure to contaminated air in rural areas and smaller cities. For instance, Rewari in Haryana, like other relatively sparse NCR districts far from Delhi, recorded annual PM2.5 levels several times higher than the World Health Organization standard of 10 micrograms per cubic metre between 1998 and 2014. And between 1998 and 2014, NCR districts in Uttar Pradesh to the southeast of Delhi - Bulandshahr, Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad - registered pollution levels comparable to or even higher than in the national capital. Rural populations tend to be more vulnerable to the effects of air pollution on their health and livelihoods since most residents work outdoors, where pollution levels are systematically higher than those indoors. /Rural populations also have comparably poorer health and poorer access to health care than their urban counterparts, making them more likely to get sick from pollution exposure and less likely to get better. Moreover, air pollutants associated with particulate matter have been show to harm crops and reduce agricultural yields, meaning that air pollution could contribute to deepening poverty. Until now, analyses of air pollution in NCR have relied primarily on a handful of permanent ground monitors run by the Central Pollution Control Board, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee and the US embassy, all located in or just outside the capital. The satellite data, in contrast, measure pollution levels for every square kilometre across India. The new data were made available by Aaron van Donkelaar, an atmospheric scientist from Dalhousie University, and coauthors, who produced the estimates based on observations from NASA satellites. The satellite imagery provides a measurement called aerosol optical depth (AOD), which is the degree to which aerosols, or particles in the air, prevent transmission of light in an area and is considered a proxy for air quality. Health ministry deputy commissioner Dr Damodar Bachani acknowledged the widespread impact of air pollution in rural areas. ""I have seen satellite images which show even rural areas are equally badly affected. The sources of air pollution may be different in rural areas but you cannot isolate urban air from rural air. The impact of air pollution also strongly dependent on wind direction because of which many rural areas are affected when wind brings pollution from other polluted areas."" While we dont know for sure what is causing severe air pollution in these districts of Uttar Pradesh, the sources identified by various research organisations include industries, brick kilns, vehicles, crop fires, waste burning and others. We also know that there are thermal power plants to the east of Delhi and the brick kilns are primarily to the northeast. The NCR's counter magnet areas, or towns and cities that act as alternatives to Delhi as centres of growth and attract migrants, among them Kanpur, Bareilly and Patiala, often suffer bad air, with pollution ranging from poor to severe. Despite this, the National Capital Region Planning Board's Regional Plan 2021 has no mechanism to address air pollution. It only states, ""The pollution impacts have to be identified through appropriate field research studies so that the levels and types of industrialisation can be established for different sub-regions."" Proper enforcement of the December 2, 2016, order of the Supreme Court on the MC Mehta petition against air pollution could reverse the trend. The court directed the notification and implementation of a graded response action plan for the entire NCR. Such a plan envisages action to reduce emissions from various sources depending on the air quality status. For example, when air quality is rated as 'emergency' (PM 2.5 levels higher than 300 micrograms per cubic metre persisting for 48 hours), the entry of trucks into Delhi, other than for essential commodities, is be stopped, vehicles on roads lowered through the odd-even scheme and other steps taken, like banning waste burning, closing brick kilns and controlling emissions from industrial units and hot mix plants. ""It has to be seen how stringently this graded response action plan is enforced in the NCR,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of Centre for Science and Environment's clean-air campaign. ""To check industrial pollution, it's important to stop the use of polluting fuels like furnace oil and pet coke, transition to modern technology for brick kilns, change thermal power plants in Dadri and Jhajjar to natural gas and upgrade emission norms for commercial vehicles to Bharat Stage 4 at the earliest."" The union health ministry has recently included chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) - a health condition closely associated with exposure to polluted air - in its non-communicable diseases programme. As Dr Bachani pointed out, ""We know of pollution's association with chronic respiratory diseases, some cancers, heart ailments, low birth weight of new-borns, early onset of cataract and other effects."" On December 20 last year, the NCR Planning Board reviewed the measures being taken by the four member states and Punjab to contain air pollution in the capital and has directed them to submit detailed action plans.(Kevin Rowe is a PhD student at Harvard University, a PhD Student Affiliate of Evidence for Policy Design, and a Vicki Norberg-Bohm Fellow.)/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

""To check industrial pollution, it's important to stop the use of polluting fuels like furnace oil and pet coke, transition to modern technology for brick kilns, change thermal power plants in Dadri and Jhajjar to natural gas and upgrade emission norms for commercial vehicles to Bharat Stage 4 at the earliest."" The union health ministry has recently included chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) - a health condition closely associated with exposure to polluted air - in its non-communicable diseases programme. As Dr Bachani pointed out, ""We know of pollution's association with chronic respiratory diseases, some cancers, heart ailments, low birth weight of new-borns, early onset of cataract and other effects."" On December 20 last year, the NCR Planning Board reviewed the measures being taken by the four member states and Punjab to contain air pollution in the capital and has directed them to submit detailed action plans.(Kevin Rowe is a PhD student at Harvard University, a PhD Student Affiliate of Evidence for Policy Design, and a Vicki Norberg-Bohm Fellow.)/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Demonetisation gives marathon a run for its money in Mumbai,"It was an adrenaline-packed Sunday morning, as the city came out on the streets for one of the most awaited sporting extravaganzas - the Mumbai Marathon. The super-charged event saw people of all ages in jerseys, with placards and banners for a cause, and above all, showing off the sporting spirit that Mumbai is so known for. Those who ran were cheered by the crowds with music, whistles, a dhol-taasha and some bhangra, too!/ The early start saw the full marathon (42 km) being flagged off from CST and the 21 km half marathon, from Worli Seaface. And finally, all eyes were on the Dream Run, which had a mixed crowd of corporates, NGOs and society. Nothing seemed to hold back the participants - some ran with kids in tow, senior war veterans with a disability showed that nothing is impossible if you have the willpower to do it, and for yet others, it was simply about being there and advocating a cause close to their hearts. You had folks running for AIDS awareness, Parkinson's disease, a cleaner Mumbai, reducing air pollution, education for girls, helping street children and the cause of farmers. Given the recent economic undercurrent, there was also an 'ATM'; as someone remarked, 'it's running this time!' Unmissable was the larger-than-life serpent slithering its way onto the track, in favour of men's rights. Pushing, laughing and making their way with other runners were surgeons in their attire, 'bees' and Yamraj, too! Inspiration appeared in the way of the oldest contestant in the marathon, 103-year-old Dagadu Bhamre from Nashik, who proved his mettle in the 4.3 km senior citizen's run./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Dipping temperature, high humidity levels worsening air pollution in Mumbai","MUMBAI: As minimum temperatures dipped and humidity levels continued to be high, pollution levels in the city breached the 'very poor' quality mark. On Tuesday, the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 307 on Tuesday. /An AQI between 301 and 400 is considered 'very poor', which, according to SAFAR, means people with heart or lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart disease or ischemic heart disease should avoid prolonged or heavy exertion. On Monday, the AQI recorded was 250.Researchers from SAFAR said the increase in pollution levels could be attributed to winter conditions and high moisture levels. ""Mumbai's humidity levels have remained high for the past few days and maximum temperatures are below normal, hence, the pollutants get trapped, making the air heavy. Low wind speeds have also not allowed the pollutants to disperse quickly,"" said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR.Among the 10 locations monitored by SAFAR, six recorded an AQI in the 'very poor' category and four remained in 'poor' category on Tuesday. Mazgaon was the most polluted at 395 and Worli was least polluted at 220.On Tuesday, the minimum temperatures at Santacruz and Colaba were 16.6 and 20 degrees Celsius respectively, lower compared to Monday. The maximum temperatures were below normal with Santacruz and Colaba recording 29.7 and 28 degrees Celsius respectively-1.5 and 0.7 degrees below normal. The AQI is expected to improve to 302 on Wednesday, but it will still be in 'very poor' category./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Not from a minister: Cow's urine can help clean air,"CHENNAI: The recent claim by a Union minister that cows inhale and exhale oxygen and that their dung can neutralise radioactive elements may have no scientific backing, but a city-based doctor says cow's urine can clean air pollution.It can trap toxic carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and particulate matter from clouds of exhaust fumes to a great extent, says Dr K Jagadeesan, founder and chief surgeon of KJ Hospital.A laboratory experiment with cow urine and thick white smoke showed it could remove carbon monoxide up to 95% and carbon dioxide up to 78%, said Dr Jagadeesan. It can also trap particulate matter up to 26%, he said.""The ammonia in cow urine has the capacity to absorb toxic elements from smoke. The enzymes in the urine dissolve the urea and it is converted into ammonia,"" he said.Inspired by Hindu priests who sprinkle cow's urine before starting a 'sacred fire' and sit comfortably in front for hours, Jagadeesan used a smoke generator to get thick white fumes from burning coconut fibre. /A reservoir connected to a jar containing two litres of cow's urine with a 6mm polythene tube. One end of another tube is inserted into the jar with the open end used to let smoke out. Both tubes in the jar are connected to a 15cm tube twisted into a coil with multiple perforations and its terminal end closed.""The generator was delivering smoke that was colourless and odourless. We collected the outcoming air and sent it to an NABL accredited lab to test for various parameters,"" Dr Jagadeesan said. ""The quantity of smoke, volume of urine and the duration it takes have a direct linear relationship.""Dr Jagadeesan is now working with IIT-M researchers to use enzymes from cow urine and develop a dry technology to clean air on a large scale. Shiva Nagendra, associate professor of IIT-M's environmental and water resources engineering division who has been working on developing air purifiers, said the acidic nature of cow urine may have the capacity to absorb toxic elements in the air, but it is still under research./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

More stubble burning in winter adds to fog,"Fine particles emitted by burning of crop residue and garbage play a major role in increasing density and duration of fog in north India, according to recent research from Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur.Looking at several years of data on air pollution and fog in Kanpur, scientists found that winters with dramatically higher levels of fine particulate matter experienced more frequent incidents of fog. These fog spells also lasted longer.For instance, in the winter of 2012-13, when average levels of PM1 hit 135ug/m3, there were 21 fog events lasting an average of 8.8 hours. The next year, when PM1 levels were lower with average around 94 ug/m3, there were only 6 fog events lasting an average of 4.8 hours.A separate analysis of fog water samples, by professor S N Tripathi and PhD researcher Abhishek Chakraborty, points to a possible explanation. /Fog is formed when moisture condenses around particles in the air. At high levels, fine particulates lead to the formation of lots of small fog droplets. Small droplets persist in the air for longer, said Tripathi, and also scatter light more efficiently, leading to greater declines in visibility.By contrast, larger droplets result in fog that is less dense and dissipates faster. Fog in the US and Europe tend to be dominated by large droplets, Chakraborty said.While industrial emissions also produce fine particulates, the studies found that particulates from biomass burning dominated high pollution days in Kanpur. Big sources of biomass burning include local garbage burning as well as crop residue fires in Punjab and Haryana in pre-winter months.Small biomass particulates are also hygroscopic or water-friendly, and thus prone to forming fog droplets, said Tripathi. These droplets get processed further during the fog and produce more particulates that are also water magnets. In effect, ""biomass burning may be facilitating formation of fog and fog in turn is processing those particulates to make them more fog-friendly,"" Tripathi said.Another cycle is at play, notes Chakraborty. As fog increases, the temperature drops, and poor people burn more trash or wood to stay warm. Those fires then emit particulates that could trigger the next local haze or fog.Fine polluted droplets are also more toxic to human health, the scientists noted. They are more concentrated and, because of their small size, enter lungs easily.While studies have previously linked the increasing incidence of winter fog in north India to rising pollution levels in the region, IIT Kanpur's ongoing research highlights the role played by the size and type of particulate matter. ""Once meteorological conditions for fog are met-low temperature, moderate wind, calm conditions and so on-then the density of fog and its persistence seems to depend on the amount of and chemical nature of the particulate matter,"" said Tripathi./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Rain relief gone, Gurugram second worst-polluted city","GURUGRAM: If rain gods had infused a fresh lease of life into the atmosphere by rinsing off pollutants on Thursday, by Sunday, diesel-run smoke-belching 'demons' had robbed the city of the clean air, leaving residents gasping.With air quality plunging back to 'poor' level, Gurgaon was adjudged the second most-polluted among 27 cities listed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Sunday. Gaya was the most polluted city in the country for the day.The city's air quality index (AQI) was reported to be 'poor' at 247, around 31% higher than Delhi's 'Moderate' AQI of 188. Going by the weather forecast, the situation is likely to get worse in the coming days of the week.The minimum temperature on Sunday remained 9 degrese Celsius while the maximum temperature was 21 degrees Celsius. ""While the maximum temperature is expected to go up to 25\xB0C from the current 20-21\xB0C, we're expecting more cloudy and foggy days this week. /There is no further forecast of rain either,"" said a Met official.The city recorded the highest concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 at 109.56\xB5g/m\xB3 on Sunday, up from nearly 50\xB5g/m\xB3 on Thursday and Friday. According to WHO, 60\xB5g/m\xB3 is the safe level for PM2.5.Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) blamed the city's proximity to multiple national and state highways for the poor air quality. ""In the NCR region, Gurgaon is perhaps the only city which is situated near a national highway - NH-8, as well as many state highways. The huge rush of heavy vehicles makes the city more polluted. Besides, diesel autos are a major source of air pollution. I don't see any other factor here for making the city's air quality worse than that of Delhi,"" said an official of HSPCB.Experts said rise in fog would add to the pollution in the days to come. ""Increase in fog means particulate matter will remain trapped in the lower atmosphere, leading to a rise in air pollution. If there is prediction of foggy days ahead, air pollution is definitely going to go up,"" said Sudhir Pandey, a former professor of environmental sciences at Delhi University./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Fire raging in Tamil Nadu industrial unit,"VELLORE: A fire broke out at the processing unit of a company in Phase III of SIPCOT in Ranipet in the early hours of Monday. The fire that was noticed at 5.15am was raging still in the afternoon.The fire broke out in the processing unit of Gujarat Enviro Protection and Infrastructure Limited. It spread fast and engulfed the raw materials and chemicals stocked in the processing unit.Fire and rescue services personnel from Ranipet and surrounding areas had been fighting for more than nine hours to bring the blaze under control. /""We have been fighting for over several hours to contain it from spreading to neighbouring units. It will subside only after the raw waste burn out,"" a fire brigade said.Six fire tenders were engaged in containing the fire. District collector S A Raman, who inspected the unit, said, ""I have instructed the local body to supply water in tankers to help the fire brigades to contain the fire. The civic body is doing so. Since the unit used to stock chemical waste, the fire brigades are using sand to contain the residual fire.""Billowing smoke caused breathing difficulty to people in the area. The collector said the pollution control board had been instructed to conduct an air pollution test.The unit is manufacturing alternative fuel for cement factories by converting waste from paint and solvent. Its licence -- issued on February 28, 2013 -- is valid till February 28, 2018. ""We have been running the unit after getting proper permission from the pollution control board. We have also following all safety norms. We don't know the cause for the fire accident,"" said an administrative staff of the company. Damage to the property was yet to be ascertained.Except a security guard, there were no other employees when the fire broke out. ""If there had been employees, they would have contained the fire,"" he said. However, he declined to reveal the names and quantity of chemicals stocked in the unit.According to the details found in the notice board of the company, it has been handling chemicals such as ferrous sulphate, hydrated lime, poly aluminum chloride, polyelectrolyte and diesel. The company has a capacity of manufacturing 50 metric tonne of alternative fuel per day.Officials from revenue and pollution control board rushed to the unit and conducted an inquiry. A team from the National Disaster Response Force also reached the spot and reviewed the situation./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"When dengue hit our area, no leader came to visit us","LUCKNOW: Unanimous distrust of government run hospitals, unaffordable private care and mismanagement of major disease outbreaks like dengue and chikungunya are just a few health-related concerns that have irked residents of Lucknow east constituency. They haven't seen or known their MLA Gopalji Tandon (BJP) after elections. Residents say it was only Swaroop Kumari Bakshi--she won the seat from 1974-1985 for four terms-who traversed the roads on foot. /A number of demands came to the fore when TOI spoke to residents. These included uplift of government health care facilities to instil people's trust in them, revision of rates for health care in government hospitals to include upper middle class and subsidised treatment and regulation in private set-ups for affordable care and health insurance schemes from the government to involve all strata of society.INDIRANAGAR| Garbage dumped in lanes attract disease-causing flies and mosquitoes, residents say. People also fear visiting government hospitals because of poor sanitation. ""There is just so much filth around that the area is a breeding ground for diseases. Even during dengue outbreak, it was only after public protests that some attention was paid, albeit temporarily,"" said Archana Mehrotra, resident of A block.Rajshree, a resident of Bhootnath, said, ""Not just dengue, seasonal fevers and viral infections are common. We have been asking public representatives for health camps, but to no avail."" Jai Singh, a resident of C block, said since private health care is costly, they had given a memorandum to candidates who came during 2012 elections to provide subsidised care to middle class in government hospitals. ""All promised us the same but nothing happened.""NEW HYDERABAD-NISHATGANJ| ""There is a Phool Park here but it doesn't even have weeds, only stones and heaps of garbage.This is the case with almost all the parks,"" pointed out KP Srivastava of New Hyderabad. ""Only Swaroop Kumari Bakshi made regular visits. Even her successor Vidya Sagar Gupta, MLA for three terms, did no footwork for us,"" he added.Residents said their demand for proper upkeep of parks has fallen on deaf ears for years. Traffic in narrow lanes causes both noise and air pollution leading to health hazards. There is no information disseminated by the health department.GOMTINAGAR| While a large number of dengue cases were reported from and around Gomtinagar, residents say there was no awareness drive and anti-larva fogging was done only around VIP homes.""There was a lot of panic around dengue outbreak in 2016 and government hospitals were not the first option for people. Private hospitals only encashed the situation and looted us,"" said RP Dubey who lives in Viram Khand. No major political party made dengue an issue, nor did any leader come to visit, said Shashikant Singh, another resident. While the area has some green cover in the form of Janeshwar Mishra Park and Lohia Park, scarcity of society parks is a concern./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

"No ban on polluting fuels in NCR, SC raps Centre","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court slammed the Centre on Monday for not taking any decision to ban polluting fuels like furnace oil and pet coke in the NCR and directed it to chalk out a comprehensive plan in a month in consultation with governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana to tackle air pollution in the capital.Pointing out that an estimated eight people die every day in the capital due to pollution-related diseases, a bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Prafulla C Pant said the governments should take immediate steps to deal with the situation. It asked the Centre to hold consultations with the parties concerned to ban the polluting fuels used by industries and explore alternatives. The bench said sulphur content in furnace oil and pet coke is too high to be allowed to be used as fuel.As the pollution level in Delhi has reached alarming levels, the Environment Pollution Control and Prevention Authority (EPCA) has recommended to the Supreme Court to ban the polluting fuels. /Although the Delhi Pollution Control Committee had declared then unacceptable fuel in the capital way back in 1996, they are not banned outside Delhi borders and are being increasingly used by industries in the NCR, contributing to the pollution levels in the city.Advocate Aprajita Singh, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, told the bench that quality of fuel played a critical role in quantum of pollution generated and sulphur level in furnace oil and pet coke was multiple times higher than in other acceptable fuels.""Samples of pet coke used in NCR contains sulphur level between 69,000 ppm to 74,000 ppm and the level of sulphur in furnace oil is between 15,000 to 20,000 ppm. It is higher in comparison to petrol/diesel with 50 ppm,"" she said.The court asked Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar to ask the Centre to take a call on banning these fuels. It also suggested that a comprehensive plan should be prepared to control pollution level in the city as various authorities were having different plans and there was lack of a holistic approach. It asked EPCA, Central Pollution Control Board, the ministry of environment and forests, Delhi and its neighbouring states to have a joint meeting to chalk out an acceptable comprehensive plan. Pleading for blanket ban on polluting fuels, EPCA in its recommendation to SC said furnace oil, being the last grade produced by refineries is extremely polluting and pet coke, a by-product, is even more polluting.""There is no doubt that the use of such high sulphur fuel is greatly contributing to pollution in the region ... The use of furnace oil and pet coke should be strictly banned in NCR. Pet coke will be allowed only in cement plants, where combustion and emissions are controlled. However, if any cement plant requires the use of pet coke, it will have to seek permission from CPCB and EPCA,"" it said.EPCA said its investigation had revealed that large quantities of furnace oil are sold in Delhi and NCR by oil companies and the sale has gone up this year with 30,000 metric tonnes being sold every month./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Lucknow's biggest scrap dump near my home',"LUCKNOW: Localities of Lucknow (north) are pockets of infectious diseases. After delimitation, voters thought they would be saved from the perils of fever and diarrhoea outbreaks in slum-turned-unorganised hamlets in the vicinity once planned colonies like Keshavnagar and Priyadrashani Colony came up.But neither public representatives nor authoities have been able to recognise a possible source of infection--the city's biggest scrap colony that has come up along Priyadarshni Colony. The scrap dealers' colony sprawls over an estimated area of 8,000 square feet and is full of discarded mugs, tubs, bottles, tyres and boxes--dengue mosquito's favourite breeding ground. /""No matter how much you tell these scrap dealers about the risk of disease here, they do not bother,"" said Preeti Shah, a social worker who lives in the area.Residents have taken their problems to the sitting MLA.""We failed to evoke any response from him,"" said Preeti who works also in the area of health awareness. ""The problem is not restricted to this area alone, many adjoining localities are bound to bear the brunt,"" said Dr AK Shukla.In Jankipuram, it is traffic jams that make people sick. ""Traffic jams are an everyday thing in the area.While noise causes headache, irratability and sleep disturbances, air pollution makes it worse for those with lung issues,"" said Prof Manoj Dixit of Lucknow University.

"India reported 1.1 million deaths due to air pollution in 2015, says a global study","NEW DELHI: The government here may be in denial mode on linking premature deaths to air pollution, but a new study on global air pollution by the US-based institutes claims that the India's worsening air pollution caused some 1.1 million premature deaths in 2015 and the country now ""rivals China for among the highest air pollution health burdens in the world.""The special report on 'global exposure to air pollution and its disease burden', released on Tuesday, noted that the number of premature deaths in China caused by dangerous fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, has stabilised in recent years but has risen sharply in India. It also said that both the countries together were responsible for over half of the total global attributable deaths while India had registered an alarming increase of nearly 50% in premature deaths from particulate matter between 1990 and 2015.Besides data analysis on air pollution, the report also carries an interactive website on the issue highlighting that 92% of the world's population lives in the areas with unhealthy air.""We are seeing increasing air pollution problems worldwide, and this new report and website details why that air pollution is a major contributor to early death,"" said Dan Greenbaum, President of the Health Effects Institute (HEI), the global research institute that designed and implemented the study. /He said, ""The trends we report show that we have seen progress in some parts of the world - but serious challenges remain.""The State of Global Air 2017 is the first of a new series of annual reports and accompanying interactive website, designed and implemented by the Health Effects Institute in cooperation with the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington and the University of British Columbia. The IHME is an independent population health research center that publishes the annual Global Burden of Diseases -- a systematic scientific effort to quantify the magnitude of health loss from all major diseases, injuries, and risk factors in populations across the world. Its results are published every year in The Lancet medical journal. ""Although there are many parts of the world where air pollution has grown worse, there has also been improvement in the US and Europe. The US Clean Air Act and actions by the European Commission have made substantial progress in reducing people exposed to PM pollution since 1990,"" said a statement issued by the HEI. Referring to the study, it said, ""The US has experienced a reduction of about 27% in average annual population exposures to fine particulate matter with smaller declines in Europe. Yet some 88,000 Americans and 258,000 Europeans still face increased risks of dying early due to PM levels today"". The report noted that the highest concentrations of combustion-related fine particulate matter were in South and Southeast Asia, China and Central and Western Sub-Saharan Africa in 2015 where household solid fuel use, coal-fired power plants, transportation, and open burning of agricultural and other wastes were among the most important contributors to outdoor air pollution. ""The Global Burden of Disease leads a growing worldwide consensus - among the WHO, World Bank, International Energy Agency and others - that air pollution poses a major global public health challenges,"" said Bob O'Keefe, Vice President of HEI and Chair of Clean Air Asia. He said, ""Nowhere is that risk more evident than in the rapidly growing economies of Asia.""The study finds that increasing exposure and a growing and aging population have meant that India now rivals China for among the highest air pollution health burdens in the world, with both countries facing some 1.1 million early deaths from air pollution in 2015.It said the long-term exposure to fine particulate matter -- the most significant element of air pollution -- contributed to 4.2 million premature deaths and to a loss of 103 million healthy years of life in 2015, making air pollution the 5th highest cause of death among all health risks, including smoking, diet, and high blood pressure.India has, however, always been sceptical of such reports. Though the government here did never deny the negative impact of air pollution on human healths, it preferred not to speak about numbers. Even recently during Budget session of the Parliament, the government had on February 6 said that there was no conclusive data to link deaths exclusively with air pollution. It, however, admitted that the air pollution could be one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and diseases.""There is no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct co-relationship of death exclusively with air pollution. Health effects of air pollution are synergistic manifestation of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity etc. of the individuals,"" said the country's environment minister Anil Madhav Dave.Dave, in his written response to a Parliament question in Rajya Sabha, had said, ""Air pollution could be one of the triggering factors for respiratory associated ailments and diseases.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Though the report sounds alarm bells for entire Asia, it paints a particularly grim picture for India where the rate of increase of premature deaths due to air pollution is even higher than in China. /It noted that while the early deaths related to PM2.5 in China has increased by 17.22% since 1990, it has increased by 48% in India.Ozone-related early deaths in India are, in fact, 33% higher than those recorded for China. India's deepening pollution problem, which hit home with a vengeance after Diwali last year as Delhi and NCR woke up enveloped in smog that refused to lift for days, has a death toll second only to China's, and together the two nations account for over half the world's deaths from pollution.According to the State of Global Air 2017 report, released in Boston on Tuesday , as many as 2.54 lakh deaths occurred in 2015 on account of exposure to ozone and its impact on chronic lung disease.India accounts for the highest number of premature deaths due to ozone pollution, its toll 13 times higher than Bangladesh's, and 21 times higher than Pakistan's.An interactive website on the report also highlights that 92% of the world's population lives in areas with unhealthy air. ""We are seeing increasing air pollution problems worldwide, and this new report and website details why that air pollution is a major contributor to early death,"" said Dan Greenbaum, president of the Health Effects Institute (HEI), the research institute that designed and carried out the study . He said, ""The trends we report show that we have seen progress in some parts of the world, but serious challenges remain"".The report was prepared by HEI in cooperation with the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington and the University of British Columbia. Involving more than 2,000 researchers, the report factored in the role of an extensive set of behavioural, dietary and environmental risk factors for more than 300 diseases in 195 countries from 1990 onwards.Referring to the findings of the report, Anumita Roychowdhury of the Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""India can't afford to remain complacent or in denial.

Centre plays down global alarm on India pollution,"NEW DELHI: The Union government expressed concern on Friday over a recent global report attributing over a million deaths in the country in 2015 to air pollution.However, it adhered to its stated position that though a serious issue, pollution was not the only reason that led to so many deaths. Playing down the findings of the 'State of Global Air 2017', Union environment minister Anil Madhav Dave said India did not work on reports from outside, and preferred to rely on research done within the country.""India trusts its own reports. /We take decisions based on our own reports... We will stress on research done by Indian institutions,"" Dave added. Admitting that air pollution was a serious issue that affected human health, he later told TOI that the country had a very clear position on this and that's why the government had been taking multiple measures to fight the menace. ""As I said in Parliament, I would like to repeat that the air pollution could be one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and diseases,"" he said. On February 6, Dave had told Parliament, ""There is no conclusive data available in the country to establish a direct co-relationship of death exclusively with air pollution. Health effects of air pollution are a synergistic manifestation of factors such as food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity etc of individuals"".Union science minister Harsh Vardhan agreed with Dave, but asserted that any report coming from bodies like the World Health Organisation should be taken ""seriously""./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Serious risk for India as pollution deaths rise: Report,"New estimates of the global burden of disease (GBD) released today by the US-based Health Effect Institute (HEI) paint a grim picture for India. Globally, air pollution is estimated to cause more than 4.2 million early deaths -- of these, 1.1 million deaths occur in India alone, more than a quarter of the global figure. India now nearly equals China which scores the highest number of early deaths due to PM2.5. Worse, India now tops the list of highest number of early deaths due to ozone pollution. /The rate of increase in early deaths in India is quite scary. While early deaths related to PM2.5 in China have increased by 17.22 per cent since 1990, in India these have increased by 48 per cent. Similarly, while early deaths due to ozone in China have stabilised since 1990, in India these have jumped by 148 per cent. Air pollution is the leading environmental cause of death worldwide; as many as 92 per cent of the world's population lives in areas with unhealthy air. The 2017 report presents a deeper analysis than the earlier GBD report (2015) and examines the long term trends from 1990 through 2015. The HEI has built on the GBD project of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), involving more than 2,000 researchers. These researchers enumerate and track death and disability and the influence of behavioral, dietary, and environmental risk factors for more than 300 diseases and injuries, by age and sex, from 1990 to the present, in 195 different countries and territories. ""India cannot afford to remain complacent or on denial any more. With so many people dying early and falling ill and losing productive years due to particulate and ozone pollution, it is a state of health emergency.

"Patna, Delhi among most polluted cities: Report","NEW DELHI: Air pollution is killing two people in India every minute, with the country's environment turning more toxic by the day, says a new study published in the journal 'The Lancet'. According to the study, some of the worst polluted cities of the world are in India. The study, released this week but based on 2010 data, estimates that, globally, 2.7-3.4 million preterm births may be associated with exposure to PM 2.5. South Asia, with 1.6 million preterm births, is the worst hit, the study addedThe review by 48 scientists and experts from 16 international institutions has warned that air pollution has adverse health effects on people even when the concentration of pollutants meets WHO standards. At the same time, it said reducing air pollution will lead to massive health benefits. /The study, called 'The Lancet Countdown: Tracking Progress on Health and Climate Change' - a review of significant scientific studies - refers to the recent International Energy Agency (IEA) report which had collated PM 2.5 exposure in lower, middle and upper income countries. In the report, Patna and Delhi figure among the most polluted cities, both having an annual PM 2.5 concentration of more than 120 micrograms per cubic metres - about 12 times the WHO guideline. The WHO annual PM 2.5 guideline is 10 micrograms per cubic metres. This IEA report had sourced data from the World Health Organisation (WHO's) urban air quality database of 2016. ""An estimated 18,000 people die every day because of exposure to ambient and household air pollution, making it the world's largest single environmental health risk. Ambient air pollution is particularly pertinent in urban areas, but it also affects non-urban populations,"" the Lancet Countdown states.""About 80% of people living in urban areas around the world are exposed to air pollution levels in excess of WHO guidelines. This number rises to 98% for urban populations in low-income and middle-income countries,"" the countdown states. The report also adds that household air pollution that results from use of solid fuels and other biomass contributes to around 4.3 million deaths annually, which are related to pneumonia, stroke, lung cancer, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).The Lancet Countdown will report annually in The Lancet journal. The institutions involved in the project includes bodies such as University College London, Tsinghua University and the Centre for Climate & Security among others. They have collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) too. The report underlines that air pollution and climate change are related and addressing air pollution will have climate change benefits too./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Won't just go by foreign data, will do study on air pollution: Centre","NEW DELHI: India might have tried to downplay the recent global report which attributed nearly 1.1 million premature deaths in 2015 to air pollution, but the absence of its own study to counter such claim appears to have ruffled many feathers within the government.It prompted the environment minister Anil Madhav Dave on Tuesday to announce that the government would come out with ""its own study"" on effects of air pollution on human health.""The environment ministry is working with the health ministry to assess the trends and impact (of air pollution) in this regard"", said Dave while emphasising that the government must trust the data coming from Indian scientists.Referring to the recent global studies, Dave said, ""These reports are often based on extrapolation without due scientific validation and there is need for caution before arriving at any conclusion.""We are also not saying that we do not take note of those studies. Neither we are saying those (global) studies are correct or they are incorrect...A proud country always trusts its own data and takes action on that. We believe in our institutions"".Though India has never denied air pollution-linked health hazards, it preferred not to speak on numbers (of deaths) in absence of any scientific study in the country. The only available report on the issue relates to an epidemiological study on ambient air quality and its impact on children in Delhi. /It was brought out by the Chittranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata in 2010.The Institute in its report highlighted impact of air pollution on human health, but didn't speak about specific number of deaths in India linked to it. The environment ministry generally avoids sharing details of air pollution-linked deaths, but it had in August 2015 made an exception and told the Parliament that more than 35,000 people had died due to acute respiratory infections (ARI) across India in over nine years from January, 2006 to mid-2015.Without attributing these deaths directly to air pollution, it had said air pollution in general causes respiratory ailments and may affect lung function. It also noted how it acts as an ""aggravating"" factor for many respiratory ailments and cardiovascular diseases. Although global studies have attributed far more deaths to air pollution in India, sharing of such data was a rare official admission that pollution could be causing deaths. The figures, shared in Rajya Sabha in August 2015, show that West Bengal reported the maximum number of ARI deaths, followed by Andhra Pradesh (united), Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Delhi.Asked about the action being taken by the Centre to deal with the menace, Dave referred to the 42-point action plan which was issued to states for implementation and said the Centre was doing its job and constantly working on what more can be done.Seeking to shift the onus on state governments and local bodies, the minister said tackling air pollution was no ""rocket science"" and the states and local bodies have to play a ""decisive"" role as the Centre can only work like a ""philosopher and guide"" to them in a federal structure.Referring to air pollution situation in Delhi, Dave noted that 20% of the air pollution comes from dust on roads and is a major reason for PM 2.5 levels. He said vehicular emissions contributed to 20% of air pollution while another 20% contribution to the bad air is made by industries, generator sets and stubble burning and stressed on the need to work on those issues by states.He, however, pointed out that the problem was not restricted to Delhi alone. ""Since Delhi's air condition becomes worse, we see it more. But the same experience is there in Patna, Bhuvaneshwar, Mumbai -- their health is affected in a similar way,"" said Dave.Emphasising that the control and abatement of air pollution is one of the key priorities of the government, Dave said the ministry was closely monitoring the trend of various air pollutants across the country under the National Air Quality Monitoring Programme.The monitoring network comprises of 680 manual stations spread over 300 cities in 29 States and 6 Union Territories. Apart from manual stations, there are 54 continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations that cover 33 cities in 12 states. The monitoring network is being expanded to cover all metro cities and capital towns.Dave said, ""The result of the monitoring shows that while the levels of particulate matters have a fluctuating trend, the value of SO2 is generally within permissible limits. Values of NO2 are also generally within the permissible limits except in few cities. ""In case of Delhi, the values of SO2 are within the permissible limits while the values of NO2 are fluctuating and slightly above the permissible limits. It is value of particulate matter which is the main concern and the government has been taking all necessary measures to mitigate this problem in a systematic manner""./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air watchdogs moot car-free day,"PATNA: The Bihar environment and forest department and the Bihar State Pollution Control Board have mooted a plan for Patna-based government officials and employees to observe car/bike-free day once every week -- a la car-free day in Delhi -- to curb air pollution.The state environment and forest department has in an official proposal recommended that officials and employees of all the departments in the secretariat and other government establishments operating out of the state capital can be asked to either pedal or walk their way to the workplace and use vehicles only in case of emergency.""It is quite often observed that government employees use official vehicles even for short distances. This does not only lead to wastage of resources but also adds to air pollution. Restriction on use of vehicles at least on a day every week will help them develop environment-friendly attitude and also inspire residents,"" a department official said on Thursday.According to state transport department sources, 15,000 and odd vehicles are in use by various state and central government wings in Patna. /Around 5,000 of these vehicles have been directly purchased by the government agencies whereas the rest are hired from private individuals and transport firms.The total numbers of vehicles plying in Patna is around 12 lakh. Though the number of government vehicles plying in the city is comparatively low, experts feel any check on vehicular emissions will help control air pollution.""Government vehicles are used more frequently than private ones. A brake on them will definitely create a positive impact. Senior officials walking or cycling not only once a week but more frequently will certainly prove a role model for others,"" said Ashok Ghosh of the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority.Patna has done little over the years to lower air pollution. The average level of PM10 - fine particulate matter that invades the lungs and triggers respiratory diseases and cancer - in the air these days has been around 350 \xB5g/m3, three-and-a-half times the corresponding daily permissible limit of 100 \xB5g/m3.Patna's air quality Index (AQI) surged to 476 on December 27 last year, the highest in the country and probably the highest ever for the city. The AQI is an assessment of the air quality taking into account eight pollutants: PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 10 micron), PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 micron), nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, ammonia and lead./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Most of Delhi up for pollution fight,"NEW DELHI: About 69% of 500 respondents interviewed for a poll on air pollution said they supported a phase-out of diesel private vehicles in the capital whereas about 56% believed vehicular emissions were the single greatest source of air pollution, followed by emissions from factories (18%) and burning of garbage (16%).The poll, commissioned by a coalition of citizens and civil society groups called Help Delhi Breathe and conducted by Human Development Society, an NGO that works on health and environmental issues, shows that residents in Delhi are ready for some strong measures to counter air pollution. The poll also shows that 49% are willing to take action individually to reduce air pollution. While 72% believed that Delhiites are responsible for implementing solutions to the crisis, 49% put the onus on the local government. /Only 15% of those interviewed from five zones of Delhi said they used public transport daily and 41% used several times a week, but 8% never used it. About 52% prefer Metro followed by 26% for e-rickshaws and cycle rickshaws for short distances, about 20% prefer DTC buses but with increased frequency and number.""Asthma was identified by more than half as a main reason for concern, while almost a quarter cited tuberculosis and lung infections, which are primarily caused by bacteria and virus but aggravated by air pollution,"" said Dr Nitish Dogra, a physician associated with the coalition. ""Other serious long-term impacts of air pollution, particularly small particulates, such as lung cancer, heart disease and dementia, were not specifically mentioned."" he added""Last August, the coalition delivered a petition asking the government to place, in every district, air quality displays with health advisories in the form of symbols and text to allow people of all classes to understand how to protect themselves,"" said Reecha Upadhyay, the coalition's coordinator. ""More than 80,000 people signed the petition to health minister Satyendar Jain but despite his promise, winter is almost over and nothing has happened. The few displays that are available are complex and don't provide any health information."" The respondents identified 20 solutions, such as promotion of plantations, reduction in number of individual cars and law enforcement, for better air./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
44 stone crushers make Amravati gasp for breath,"CHANDIGARH: Residents of Amravati Enclave near Panchkula have complained about air and noise pollution because of re-starting of crushers adjoining national highway 22 on PanchkulaShimla road and Burj Kotian zone in Chandimandir area.One of the oldest private townships of Panchkula districts, around 2,000 families are living in the enclave. A majority of residents are senior citizens, including military veterans, judges and other high-ranking retired of ficers. Crushers were closed since 2011 and started recently.Around 20,000 people living in Amravati, DLF area, Chandimandir, Burj Kotia, Jallaha and Surajpur village are stated to be affected from these crushers.As per the complaint given to Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), Amravati Enclave Residents Welfare Association (AERWA) said around 44 stone crushers have recently started crushing stones because of which people of the area are suffering from air and noise pollution and chronic diseases like asthma is spreading.The complaint has also mentioned the report of Dr Rameshwar Chander, medical superintendent of the polyclinic located inside the enclave, stating that inhaling of dust particles from these crushers is causing further respiratory diseases among people living in the area. /""Chronic bronchitis and airway obstruction is a result of long term exposure to these air pollutants that also cause allergenic alveolitis in young children. Exposures to dust can lower lung respiration resulting in infections like tuberculosis. Noise caused by the crushers affects humans slowly and can finally cause noise-induced hearing loss and permanent deafness,"" the report has mentioned.The school principal located inside the enclave had also complained that dust particles from crushers are causing respiratory problems among children.Report of the doctor as well as the complaint of the school principal is attached with the complaint of the association. Besides this, two senior residents Lt Gen B S Jaswal (retd), former Army commander (Northern Command), and Justice Baldev Singh (retd), former high court judge, had also complained about the noise and air pollution caused by crushers, especially during the night time.Shamsher Sharma, president, AERWA, told TOI, ""Some crushers are just 50 metres from the national highway and adjoining our residential area but government authorities are not bothered about the health of residents. Around 20,000 people living in Amravati, DLF area, Chandimandir, Burj Kotia, Jallaha and Surajpur village in the area are suffering from the dust and noise emanating from the crushers."" Colonel Roy Avikash (retd), general secretary, AERWA, said crushers' zone is a hazardous industry, either CLU (change of land use) should not have been granted for township or crushers should be kept away. ""The area is also safe zone for wildlife and declared eco-sensitive zone but activities of crushers adversely affected them,"" Col Roy added.When contacted, S Narayanan, member secretary, HSPCB, told TOI that he was out for training for the last week and had not seen the complaint.

Chimney still missing in Sapras crematorium,"Pimpri Chinchwad: Those staying near Tilak school in Khadki cantonment are a harried lot.They have to put up with foul smell and smoke emanating from the Kailas crematorium in Sapras near Holkar bridge almost throughout the day since the Khadki Cantonment Board (KCB), even after 10 years, is yet to install a chimney at the crematorium.Babulal Yelpur, who stays near Tilak school, said, ""The dead bodies here are cremated at any time of the day due to which we face the problem of smoke and foul smell almost throughout the day."" Similar view was shared by another resident, Sangeeta Gosavi.In July 2007, many students of the school suffered due to the foul smell emanating from the burning of dead bodies. The students were taken to a hospital for treatment and were later discharged. /The cantonment then took a decision to not allow cremation during school hours. The cantonment had also approved a resolution to construct a chimney at the crematorium then.Manish Anand, elected Congress member, said the cantonment had approved a resolution for installing the chimney at the crematorium in his previous term, but nothing has happened since then. Ironically, the KCB is now going ahead with a gas-based crematorium. Duryodhan Bhapkar, vice-president, KCB, said the work of constructing a gas-based crematorium will take around two years.Amol Jagtap, chief executive officer, KCB, said as per new NGT norms, chimneys with a 30-meter height have to be installed at traditional crematoriums to reduce air pollution.Brig. Dhiraj Mohan, president, KCB, said, ""It is feasible to have a common chimney for traditional and new gas-based crematorium since it will reduce the total cost of the project. The cost of the gas-based project is Rs 1.5 crore, out of which chimney would cost Rs 30 lakh. The KCB will wait for approval for the gas-based project till July. If the approval doesn't come, we will construct the chimney for the traditional crematorium.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Air pollution affects antibiotics too, says new study","MUMBAI: It is well known that air pollution affects people's health and makes them more prone to a range of diseases right from heart attack to cancer, but a new research paper from the United Kingdom claims air pollution reduces the efficacy of antibiotics.Black carbon, a major component of air pollution, is produced due to the burning of fossil fuels such as diesel and biomass. The study published in the latest edition of the medical journal Environmental Microbiology looked into how air pollution -- mainly black carbon -- affects the bacteria living in our bodies, specifically in the nose, throat and lungs.``The research shows that this pollutant changes the way in which bacteria grow and form communities, which could affect how they survive on the lining of our respiratory tracts and how well they are able to hide from, and combat, our immune systems,'' said a press release sent by the University of Leicester. The research focused on Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, both bacteria that are major causes of respiratory diseases and exhibit high levels of resistance to antibiotics. /The research team found that black carbon alters the antibiotic tolerance of Staphylococcus aureus communities and importantly increases the resistance of communities of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin, the front-line treatment of bacterial pneumonia. ``It was found that black carbon caused Streptococcus pneumoniae to spread from the nose to the lower respiratory tract, which is a key step in development of disease,'' the release added. The paper's lead author Dr Julie Morrisseysaid: ""This work increases our understanding of how air pollution affects human health. It shows that the bacteria which cause respiratory infections are affected by air pollution, possibly increasing the risk of infection and the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment of these illnesses.''/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
India fails to protect its Under-5 kids,"NEW DELHI: India accounts for the second highest death rate of children under 5 years due to environmental risks - mainly pollution and poor sanitation - in the WHO south east Asia region which includes Bangladesh, Indonesia and Bhutan.

Pirana poison leaching into groundwater: Panel,"GANDHINAGAR: The Estimates Committee of the Gujarat assembly has sought action against Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) for exposing lakhs of citizens, living near Pirana garbage dump, to toxic smoke for three decades. The committee has accused the AMC of ""negligence and doing little to mitigate a public health hazard."" (The committee scrutinises government policies and administrative actions.) /The policy audit body has also pointed out that the leachate - water leaking through Pirana mound - from the 75 lakh tonnes of waste is now polluting even groundwater. This water is pumped out by private boring installed in nearby residential areas.In its report tabled in the state assembly, the committee has said that during its visit to the Pirana landfill and surrounding areas, the panel had noted that the site was a serious health hazard. ""It's not only releasing toxic elements hazardous to people but also polluting the river and nearby water bodies,"" the panel has stated in its report. It has further said that the site should have been closed earlier. The site has now turned into a mountain and has garbage many times more than its capacity. ""The constant fire and smoke is causing hazardous air pollution in the area,"" the report states.Apart from demanding closure of the Pirna landfill site, the Estimates Committee has also sought upgrading of the facilities of central effluent treatment plant around Ahmedabad to ensure that untreated toxic effluent does not flow downstream into the Sabarmati. Apart from action against the AMC, the committee has asked the civic body to follow waste management rules of 2001. Urban local bodies are not following the set guidelines for garbage disposal even for Pirana site.An independent research has claimed that landfill leachates that seep into groundwater contain toxic compounds like plasticizers (phthalates, benzenesulfonamides), phenolic antioxidants, chlorinated phenols./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Dhabas to feel heat for cooking in coal fire,"BHUBANESWAR: Unfazed by a ban order, a number of road side hotels and dhabas in five districts-Dhenkanal, Sambalpur, Angul, Jharsuguda and Sundargarh-continue to use coal as the main source of fuel. It is evident from a letter of state home department's special secretary Lalit Das, who asked the Odisha police to conduct massive crackdown on such eateries. TOI is in possession of the letter sent by Das to DGP and all SPs in districts on March 10. The state forest and environment department in a gazette notification on October 27 last year banned the use of raw coal in hotels in those five districts, having large deposits of the combustible black stone.The home department intervened after the state pollution control board drew their attention about violation of the gazette notification. /""We requested the district collectors and SPs to check the unrestricted use of raw coal in the roadside dhabas in the five districts in view of air pollution. The restriction is in force for the five districts only as coal is abundantly available and used by eateries, causing air pollution,"" said a senior scientist of state pollution control board Debashis Ray. Officials said availability of coal dissuades dhaba operators from shifting to cooking gas. Recently, a committee of the state Assembly toured the five districts to check the enforcement of the ban on coal-fired fuel. ""The committee gave an adverse report to us. The committee found huge smog in the air and interacted with the employees of the dhabas. The employees said they often fell sick due to burning of the coal,"" said another officer of the state pollution control board. The committee in its report said coal combustion can affect lung tissue, exacerbate asthma and make people more susceptible to chronic respiratory diseases, the report said. Particulate matter and fly ash generated from the coal burning can cause chronic bronchitis, aggravated asthma, and premature death, as well as haze obstructing visibility, the report added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Residents choke as Bhandewadi fire continues to rage on Day 2,"NAGPUR: Even after 24 hours, fire continued to rage in the Bhandewadi dump yard on Wednesday, emitting toxic fumes in surrounding areas. Though it was brought under control, the thick smoke billowing from the 55-acre dump yard could be spotted from residential areas within five-kilometer radius. After 2002, this is the biggest fire at Bhandewadi. The cause of the major fire, which broke on Tuesday at around 9.45am, is yet to be ascertained. /While some experts who conducted spot inspection on Wednesday called it a 'natural outbreak due to rise in temperature', others blamed it on a carelessly-tossed cigarette or 'bidi' butt. ""The fire erupted from the rear side of the dumpyard where the compound wall was broken by nearby slum dwellers,"" said NMC officials. The outbreak took place at the windrows that were created as an initial step for bio-mining process that Nagpur Municipal Corporation is attempting for the first time. TOI visited the site on Wednesday afternoon and saw that fire was flaring-up at various spots near the landfill site. As far as the naked eye could see, thick black smoke was emanating from the dumping yard, where the total volume of piled-up solid municipal waste is about 18 lakh metric tonnes. Daily, 1,100 tonnes of city's garbage is dumped at the site. The hills of trash, that have spread outside the original landfill site are over 20 feet high. After trying to douse fire for over 12 hours till Tuesday midnight, firefighters again resumed the operations on Wednesday morning. On Tuesday, four fire tenders from the NMC's fire and emergency services department completed over 40 trips to bring the flames under control. On the second day too, three fire tenders were deployed at the dump yard. Overall, around 1.8 lakh litres of water was used to control the fire. According to officials, it might take another four-five days to extinguish the fire completely. While initially the firefighters had to struggle to navigate the source of fire, they also had a tough time extinguishing it due to the height of garbage piles. ""The fire is not on the surface and spraying water directly on the garbage will not extinguish it as water will flow away. We are first using excavators to dig out the solid waste. The pits filled with solid waste are at least 50-60 feet deep,"" said a firefighter.Officials from fire department lamented over shortage of manpower. Members of Green Vigil Foundation, who were on the spot till Tuesday late night, said that at least ten tenders are needed to completely control the fire. ""Water tankers are making trips at the site. But the fire has been spread out in a vast area and it has to be blocked from all sides. At least ten tankers should spray water simultaneously from ten different angles,"" said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of Green Vigil.Officials informed that a similar massive fire had broke out in the dump yard in 2002. Last year too, TOI had reported incidents of fire-outbreaks at Bhandewadi. The worst sufferers are the residents living in the periphery of the dump yard, who are being exposed to high air pollution. ""On Tuesday afternoon, it went suddenly dark and we thought the weather is getting cloudy. Later on we started feeling suffocated and realized that it is smoke,"" residents said. A nine-year-old boy living in nearby slums also got an asthama attack late in the night. ""He is unable to breathe. Our houses are filled with black some,"" his mother said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Swargadwar crematorium, encroached, government to remove squatters","BHUBANESWAR: In a belated move, the Puri district administration is gearing up to remove encroachment in and around Swargadwar crematorium, facing the sea. At least 30 hotels, lodgings and shops allegedly encroached on nearly 15 acre prime land, which originally belongs to Lord Jagannath.""We came to know that some people illegally managed to possess vast patches of Jagannath's land in late 1980s. Puri Shankaracharya was caretaker of the land. Though those people possess valid land documents, legally those land should not have been transferred or sold. /I have asked the revenue officials to verify. We will serve notices to the people to vacate the land,"" Puri district collector Aravind Agrawal told TOI. Sources said the encroachers included some influential politicians, hoteliers and a servitor of Jagannath Temple. The district administration plans to use the land for expansion and periphery development of Swargadwar. ""We will expand the crematorium for which we require nearly 1.5 acre. The remaining land can be used for plantation and other beautification works,"" Agrawal said. The administration also came to know that nearly 465 decimal from the one-acre crematorium was illegally recorded in the name of some persons in 1989. ""We are trying to find out how the portion of the Swargadwar land was owned by others. Criminal cases will be registered against those found guilty,"" Agrawal said. ""How could the administration sleep for years? We strongly suspect nexus between corrupt officials and land mafias. The entire 15 acre land of Lord Jagannath should be immediately acquired. How could the Puri Konark Development Authority approve building plans on the land,"" asked Jagannath Bastia, president of Beach Protection Council of Odisha, a social outfit. Jagannath Sena, another social outfit, pointed finger at the Puri municipality, which maintains the crematorium. ""Most of the municipality officials dance to the tune of local MLA Maheswar Mohanty. The land fraud happened between 1985 and 1995 when local MLA Maheswar Mohanty was chairman of the Puri municipality. The legislator helped his acquaintances to grab the Swargadwar land,"" Mancha's convener Priyadarshan Pattnaik said. Despite repeated attempts, Mohanty was unavailable for comment. Many opine, the Swargadwar should be shifted to Puri outskirts. ""It is good the collector is going to remove encroachers. But he is moving far behind the time. Several years ago, Swargadwar was a lonely place. Now, it is surrounded by houses, hotels and human habitation. Smoke bellowing from Swargadwar creates air pollution. In view of traffic congestion, people find it difficult to reach Swargadwar,"" said Pramod Rath, a social worker./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
CSE welcomes SC ruling on BS-III,"Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has welcomed today's landmark judgment of the Supreme Court bench comprising Justice Madan B Lokur and Justice Deepak Gupta, directing the automobile industry to stop the sale of Bharat Stage III (BS-III) vehicles from April 1, 2017 anywhere in India. Only Bharat Stage IV vehicles can be sold nation-wide from April 1, 2017. If any BS-III vehicle comes for registration after April 1, the state transport departments will have to check its proof of sale before March 31, 2017. In its order, the bench said clearly that even though the BS-III inventory is small compared to the total stock of vehicles in the country, keeping in view the growing air pollution and public health concern, commercial interest cannot supersede public health interest and the Fundamental Right to Life. Commenting on the Court's decision, Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, CSE, said: ""This is a significant step forward as this gives the message and the lesson that the automobile industry will have to walk the extra mile to address the expansive concern around public health and not weigh down the transition by taking a very narrow technical view."" During the hearing of this case, the automobile industry had submitted company-wise data on the unsold inventory of BS-III vehicles (see link /<a href=""http://cseindia.org/userfiles/SIAM-Data-Analysis-note-24.3.17.pdf"">http://cseindia.org/userfiles/SIAM-Data-Analysis-note-24.3.17.pdf</a>/). According to the industry's data, there are about 8,24,275 unsold BS-III vehicles in the country. /They include 96,724 commercial vehicles; 6,71,305 two-wheelers; 16,198 four wheelers; and 40,048 three-wheelers. The industry wanted to be given a year to sell the unsold stock. Said Roychowdhury: ""It is unacceptable that even though the industry is producing BS-IV vehicles since 2010 for earmarked regions, most companies have not slowed down the production of BS-III vehicles; instead, they have chosen to remain in a business-as-usual state. There has been no proactive strategy in place to prepare for this transition."" However, CSE analysts also point out that there are some companies which have taken the steps to stop production of BS-III vehicles in advance. These include major car companies like Maruti Udyog Ltd, Toyota, Hyundai, General Motors and the leading two-wheeler manufacturer Bajaj Auto Ltd. But this should have been the common and uniform proactive corporate strategy across the industry, says Roychowdhury. This transition is critical as the movement from BS-III to BS-IV can lead to substantial reductions in particulate matter emissions. For instance, from new trucks, the emissions can dip by 80 per cent and from cars by half. Similarly, hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions - a big concern from two-wheelers - can reduce by 41-80 per cent, depending on the engine size. CSE analysts point out that Delhi-NCR and the rest of India cannot afford to lock in toxic pollution in an inventory of vehicles meeting older and lax norms of Bharat Stage III, as these vehicles will remain on road for the next 15-20 years. Air pollution has already emerged as a serious public health crisis in the Delhi-NCR region as well as in rest of the country. The 2017 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) report says India has the second highest number of early deaths due to PM2.5 in the world. Early deaths due to ozone pollution are the highest in India. More than a quarter of global deaths due to air pollution occur in India alone. The refinery sector has already made enormous investments to improve the refinery technology and upgrade the fuel quality to BS-IV grade from April 1, 2017. After today's Court order, all new vehicles to be sold in India from April 1, 2017 will also meet only BS-IV emissions norms. Given the fact that as many as 20 million vehicles are registered in a year (as per the data of the Union ministry of road transport and highways), this transition will make significant difference to public health exposure, says Roychowdhury./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Bhandewadi smoke may cause cancer, hit growth","Nagpur: The frequent fires at Bhandewadi dumping yard are pushing the city's air pollution to dangerously high levels. The toxic smoke that rolls out of Bhandewadi is a danger to the health of residents in many nearby areas.The damage caused by the recent fire, which lasted for almost a week, and is yet to be doused completely, is so high that it is difficult to arrive at any figures, but we can only guesstimate. Various experts that TOI spoke to gave different opinions. However, the calculations done by them and TOI reveal that it was an environmental and health disaster of significant proportions.Experts say it is difficult to quantify the toxins released when municipal solid waste is burnt, without regular monitoring and a scientific study. /Also, while not everyone will get the same dose of toxic elements, a conjecture of the potential exposure can be made. According to top sources in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), around 12,000 metric tonnes of waste was burnt in the fire. A senior professor of plastics and polymer technology said that 1kg plastic generates 3kg of carbon dioxide. Assuming that 12% of the waste consisted of plastic, the total carbon dioxide generated will be over 43.2L kilograms.While people living in the proximity of the dumping ground have been complaining about breathing problems, asthma, bronchitis, allergies and poor vision, experts warned that prolonged and repeated exposure to toxic gases can eventually lead to chronic diseases including cancer. ""When waste, mainly plastic, is burned, dioxins and furans are emitted. They are extremely toxic and carcinogenic,"" said Harshvardhan Modak, consultant of solid waste management.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), dioxin is released into the environment due to uncontrolled and incomplete burning of waste. ""Once dioxins enter the body, they last a long time because of their chemical stability. Their half-life in the body is estimated to be 7-11 years,"" a report by WHO stated.Dioxins were evaluated by the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 1997 and 2002. Based on animal and human epidemiology data, IARC classified dioxin as a ""known human carcinogen"", depending on the level of exposure. ""Short-term exposure may result in skin lesions, altered liver function while long-term exposure is linked to impairment of the immune system, the developing nervous system, the endocrine system and reproductive functions,"" WHO stated.The report added that developing foetus is most sensitive to dioxin exposure. As per the calculations suggested by experts, 3.45 crore times more dioxins than the ideal limits were released when MSW caught fire at Bhandewadi.Rakesh Kumar, director of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri), said that different pollutants are released from different types of solid waste. ""Municipal solid waste is a mix of different products like wood, metal, clothes, jute, biomass, plastic etc. There are many by-products of burning solid waste, including hydrocarbons, dioxins and furans, which have a significant impact on human health,"" he added.As reported by TOI earlier, fires are frequent throughout the year at the Bhandewadi dumping ground. Some officials call it man-made and blame ragpickers and trespassers, others say it is natural and is caused due to release of methane gas, which is highly flammable.Though the areas surrounding the Bhandewadi dumping ground were wrapped in a blanket of smoke after the massive fire, experts said that effects can even extend to far-off areas where smoke cannot be seen or smelled. Many residents of Wardhaman Nagar and Deshpande Layout too have complained of respiratory problems. ""The spreading of smoke or pollution depends on wind velocity. If not the entire city, the effect can be strongly seen within a four-kilometer radius,"" said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of Green Vigil. With the emission of carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen and sulphur on a large scale, the city's air quality is definitely deteriorating, said Chatterjee. ""Garbage or biomass burning also contributes around 2-3 per cent to acid rain,"" he added.Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said that residents staying close to the dump yard face a serious risk of suffering from acute smoke inhalation. ""Toxic gases gets diluted in the air. The distance till which they can spread depends on various factors like size of the fire, air currents, toxicity of the gases and dilution. Pollutants released from forest fires usually go upwards in the atmosphere but in cities, tall buildings act as obstructions. Poisonous gases circulate and stay in extra concentration in close pockets,"" he said. Chatterjee said that areas under downwind direction are likely to suffer more. Repeated exposure to such gases can lead to chronic diseases. ""Exposure to carbon monoxide is the most dangerous; it dramatically reduces oxygen level and haemoglobin,"" Sarnaik said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
3 out of 4 Delhi vehicles skip pollution test: EPCA report,"NEW DELHI: More than three out of every four vehicles in Delhi do not have a pollution under-control certificate. Among the few who do get their vehicles tested, an overwhelming 95% across Delhi NCR manage to pass the test, which makes a mockery of the pollution under control (PUC) programme.These and other disturbing facts -which have a direct bearing on air pollution in the region -have come to light in an audit of pollution checking centres in Delhi-NCR by the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), conducted at the behest of the Supreme Court. EPCA recommends, the annual insurance of vehi cles be linked with PUC certificates as a way to ensure 100% compliance with pollution norms in Delhi-NCR. Apart from abysmally low compliance levels and poor testing standards, the EPCA audit also found that data on vehicles undergoing PUC tests was not being properly maintained and there was hardly any monitoring of rules.The report, which is in the draft stage and is now being expanded to add more towns, shows a shockingly low compliance rate for PUC testing in the NCR towns studied till date. /The report cites data supplied by Delhi transport department for the period November 2016 to January 2017, which says 1.37 million PUC tests were conducted. The total number of vehicles in Delhi was 6.47 million as on August 2016.Taking into account the number of BS-IV and preBS-IV vehicles, as well as the break-up of two, three and four-wheelers, the report says, ""The number of PUC tests to be conducted per quarter should be at least 5.91 million."" The compliance rate is thus a dismal 23.2%. ""A large number of vehicles in Delhi, around three out of every four vehicles, remain outside the PUC testing network,"" the re port concludes.That's not all. The testing methodology too was found to be lax, which has resulted in low fail rates across NCR. While the failure rate -the number of vehicles failing the emission test-is 4.69% overall, it's a spectacularly low 0.49% in NCR towns of Uttar Pradesh. In fact, in UP, the failure rate of two-wheelers is only 0.39% and that of fourwheelers, 0.59%.Incredibly, 43.92% of vehicles tested, which were preBharat Stage IV, had smoke density values between 0-10 HSU -which makes these vehicles super clean in terms of emissions. Pre-BS-IV vehicles are allowed smoke density values up to 65 HSU, while for BS-IV it is 50 HSU. Only 1.14% of BS-IV vehicles were found to be in the 50 HSU range.In Delhi, the testing quality was hardly any better. The fail rate for diesel vehicles in Delhi was a meagre 1.61% while for petrol vehicles, it was 5.18%. Only 4.65% of vehicles running on a different fuel failed the emission test.Delhi's PUC data showed nearly all diesel vehicles tested were below 50 HSU. More than three-fifth of diesel vehicles had smoke density values that were as less as 60% of the norm set for BS-IV vehicles.Shockingly, 20% of the 12 lakh petrol vehicles whose data was shared had zero carbon monoxide values, while 88% of two and four-wheelers apparently meet the stringent standards for hydrocarbon emissions.Few state governments seem to have adequate data, not even a cumulative list of the percentage of vehicles complying with PUC rules.The draft report says that in most NCR towns, data-keeping is purely manual. Records of the number of vehicles tested, registration details and year of manufacture are maintained although actual tested emission levels of both diesel and petrol vehicles is not available in most districts.As the draft report says, ""Poor quality of PUC databases has restricted the scope of this assessment.""The report finds a number of other lapses, including illmaintained equipment, lack of documentation on calibration of equipment as well as fake certificates. It recommends standardising periodicity of PUC certificates; introducing automatic online network of transmission of PUC data to a central server to minimise interference and allow for proper analysis and strengthening inspection of PUC centres for quality control. It also suggests overhauling the emission tests and tightening norms for diesel vehicles.Ironically, EPCA had in 2003 carried out a similar exercise for the Supreme Court, which had revealed systemic problems with the PUC programme. The draft audit report states: ""The new assessment shows that while several of the systemic problems have continued, newer challenges have emerged."" The EPCA has now asked for more data from the various state governments, as well as broadened the scope of the study by auditing more NCR towns, said an EPCA member. ""The report will be finalised and completed by end of April,"" the official said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Two new drugs under trial for tuberculosis treatment,"Nagpur: Two new drugs for tuberculosis, Bedaquline and Delemanite, are being tested in six cities in the country for effectiveness and efficacy. After the six-month trial, the drugs could be brought in use for patients at large.Dr Digambar Behera, professor and head, department of pulmonary medicine at PGI Chandigarh told TOI that the drugs are being tested on 600 patients at Ahmedabad, Mumbai (two places), Guwahati, New Delhi (two hospitals) and Chennai. ""Such trials are conducted under stringent conditions. /The results are expected to be good and drugs could be used in a few months or a year,"" he said. Dr Behera was in the city for the national meet on pulmonology.Dr Behera said that India had about 2.8 million new cases of TB every year. Besides these, 1 lakh cases of multi-drug resistance TB are added every year. ""Efforts are on to use the latest tests like geneXpert to diagnose MDR in 65 laboratories pan India,"" he said.Patients with HIV infection and suffering from tuberculosis are also being treated on priority in six states under a national programme. These patients are now put under a daily regimen as against the usual three-times course. ""Here, involvement of private practitioners is being sought. Generally they treat the patient but don't report it to the government authorities. They are not bothered about the follow-up. This is what results in drug resistance. These patients should be notified,"" said Dr Behera.Talking about other respiratory diseases, Dr Behera said that air pollution specifically due to burning of biomass in rural areas was responsible for chronic respiratory ailments in women more than men. Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) were also increasing. There are about 1-3 crore asthma patients and 1.8 lakh COPD patients in country. Asthma is curable but depends on access to inhalers.Dr Behera said Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) is also on the rise. It is a progressive disease and can be diagnosed through scans and lung biopsy. But lung cancers were taking a toll of both men and women. Smokers comprise 30-35% of the population. Almost 15% of lung cancer patients don't survive beyond five years. PGI Chandigarh is conducting a study on personalized therapy for gene mutation.There have been a lot of developments in treating sleep disorders, including sleep apnoea. Almost 3-6% population suffers from these disorders. ""The CPAP machines available from last few years has revolutionized the treatment of sleep apnoea,"" said Dr Behera./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
1.7 crore urban households in India don't have separate a kitchen: Report,"NEW DELHI: At least one-fourth of urban households in India don't have separate a kitchen, according to recently released data based on the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) carried out by the housing ministry.The survey indicates how nearly 1.7 crore urban households may be using their single room for cooking food as well.This fresh data gains importance considering that different studies have shown how air pollution in kitchens has become a major health concern and that too in urban areas where the ambient air is getting increasingly polluted due to vehicular emission and dust.A recent study published in Elsevier, a journal on environmental research, which assessed people's personal exposure to pollution in Delhi, showed how kitchens can be more polluted than roads.The study mentioned how urban households, particularly kitchens, could be enveloping people in PM 2.5 pollutants as well.Other studies across the globe have also shown how kitchen appliances release colourless pollutants. Kitchens also get more polluted when they lack proper ventilation.In fact, the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), launched by PM Narendra Mod, was a big step towards making kitchens smoke-free for women who are often the worst-affected by such pollution.According to SECC data, while Mizoram has the maximum percentage of such households, Bihar ranks second. In Daman and Diu and Kerala, over 90% households have exclusive kitchens.SECC data shows that in 2011, when the survey was conducted through a comprehensive door-to-door enumeration across the country, nearly 24.5% of urban households had a single room.Sources in the housing ministry said the SECC data collected in 2011 is being utilised in sanctioning houses for the urban poor with central aid under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. /SECC data, which conceals sensitive caste and poverty details in urban areas, gives details of how many families are ""houseless"" and how many live in rented accommodations in towns and cities./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Bhandewadi dump yard on fire again, this time its more intense","Nagpur: The city's dumping yard at Bhandewadi is up in flames for the second time in less than 25 days. However this time, the fire is so widespread that it has engulfed almost the entire dumping yard.Workers at the site informed that the fire was simmering for the last few days and started raging on Monday morning with severe intensity. The thick layer of smoke emanating from the yard enveloped areas as far as 2-3 kilometres - affecting nearby schools, residential areas and slums. /The domes of the Swaminarayan temple were barely visible till late afternoon.In the last fire that broke out on March 21, around 30 windrows of solid waste created for bio-composting were destroyed. This time, 200 windrows spread over an area of 6-7 acres caught fire, informed the field staffers. According to Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials, 1 windrow holds 400 metric tonne of municipal solid waste. Going by the calculations, a sizeable part of the 80,000 metric tonne of garbage is likely to be burned.The exact cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. The workers said the fire could have started again because the earlier one must not have completely extinguished. One of the workers, who has been posted at the spot for over 20 years now, said this was the biggest fire he has seen so far. ""The windrows have to be kept dry as per expert advice. But, in the summer, this is dangerous as there are more chances of the fire spreading even if a small plastic catches fire,"" he said.After spotting flames billowing from the windrows, the officials alerted NMC's fire and emergency services department which deployed six fire tenders at the spot. In the evening, another three tenders were sent. Following the suggestions of NGO Green Vigil Foundation, treated sewage from the NMC's Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) at Bhandewadi is being used to douse the fire.Apart from this, heaps of soil were also dumped on the windrows to extinguish the fire. When TOI went to the spot in the afternoon, the windrows on all four sides of the scientific landfill site were on fire. ""This method of extinguishing fire by soil won't help much in case of such a large-scale fire. Where will NMC get so much soil from?"" said Green Vigil founder Kaustav Chatterjee.At some spots, poclain machines were turning the windrows upside down and pushing it forward to control the fire. ""This can prove to be more dangerous as the heaps of waste contain plastic which only spreads the fire. The best way is to confine the raging fire by spraying water in the gaps between flames. If the garbage is wet, fire will not spread,"" said Chatterjee, adding that more number of tenders are needed.The fire has spiked the already high air pollution. After the last fire, NMC had reportedly ramped up the security at the dumping yard to avoid entry of ragpickers who often set fire to burn waste and collect valuable items. In the morning, angry residents blocked several trucks which were bringing in fresh garbage to be dumped. They were upset over the pollution caused by the repeated fires. Cops from Nandanvan police station reached the spot to take control of the situation. It took more than an hour for the people to disperse./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"NMC says 50% of the fire doused, photos contradict","Nagpur: Twenty-four hours after a massive fire broke at the city's dumping yard in Bhandewadi on Monday, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials claimed that 50% of the major fire was doused. However, a TOI photographer who visited the spot, felt that the fire was still raging and had even spread to other parts of the area where garbage is illegally piling up. Even on the second day, a thick layer of the smoke could be seen 2-3 kms from the area.NMC commissioner Shravan Hardikar told TOI that it was difficult to ascertain if the fire was ""natural or man-made"".The civic chief said that the workers at the site are trying to contain the fire by making barriers between the windrows (garbage piled up in different heaps). ""We are turning the waste upside down using JCBs to minimize the air contact. /As the waste is completely dry, we are also dumping wet soil on it to stop the fire from spreading,"" said Hardikar.This is the second time that the dumping ground is in flames in less than 25 days. Fearing more fire outbreaks, the NMC is now trying to speed up the tendering process for bio-mining. As reported by TOI earlier, the civic body plans to clear around 6-7 acres of land currently over-flowing with illegally dumped municipal solid waste.Following TOI's report on Tuesday on the large-scale emission of toxic gases from the site, city activist Ankita Shah has filed a complaint with state chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board's member secretary P Anbalagan, Ministry of Environment and Forests and other concerned authorities. Another complaint has been filed with the National Green Tribunal.In her complaint, Shah has also mentioned about the fire on March 21 which saw around 30 windrows affected. A sizeable part of the 12,000 MT waste got burnt. The fire over the last two days is likely to have affected around 200 windrows, burning a sizeable part of 80,000 MT waste, informed NMC sources.Shah wrote that as per rule no. 16 of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, ""it is MPCB's duty to enforce these rules in the state through local bodies and review their implementation at least twice a year"".The frequent fires are not only spiking air pollution but releasing toxic substances like dioxins and furans, which according to experts can cause cancer, impotence, asthma, growth defects and other serious health ailments.Stating that public life is in danger, Shah demanded stringent action in the case. ""The fire incidents have not claimed any lives till now. But due to the negligent attitude of civic authorities, a serious mishap can take place,"" she said, adding that an FIR should be registered after proper investigation./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution complaints to BMC rose 63% in 2016,"MUMBAI: A 63% increase in the number of air pollution complaints received by the BMC was observed in 2016 compared to the previous year. In fact, in January and December 2016 the recorded Air Quality Index (AQI) was higher than in previous years. /Incidentally, last January a fire broke out in the Deonar dumping ground which went on for almost a week. A civic white paper released by the NGO Praja stated that in 2015, the BMC received 94 air pollution complaints while in 2016 it went up to 153. On the other hand, complaints registered owing to pollution due to chemical effluents in 2015 stood at 33, while in 2016 it went up to 51. Milind Mhaske project director at the NGO Praja said, ""These figures are from complaints made to BMC on their helpline 1916 and also those registered with them on their website. The figures clearly indicate people today are waking up to the problem of pollution and it's important the authorities take cognizance of it."" Neha Parkhi, programme officer from System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research project said, ""Even we have started getting more queries on air pollution."" ""Today, the situation is such that in case of a blaze at the dump, parts of the city far from the dump also get enveloped in smoke. The smell of garbage burning definitely does not go unnoticed,"" said Kala Suresh, who lives off the Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'Change policy to stop crop fire',"NEW DELHI: Within a week or so, the national capital region will see a spike in air pollution levels as farmers across north India are likely to start burning wheat stubble following harvest of the rabi crop. Agricultural experts are recommending a major overhaul in policies to address this ""deep-rooted"" problem. At a conference on 'Connecting the Dots - Air quality challenges in monitoring, implementation and health' on Wednesday, air quality and agricultural experts said the government needed to address the issue holistically and not just by penalising farmers. /National Green Tribunal has imposed a fine ranging from Rs 2,500 to Rs 15,000 - depending on the farm size - on farmers who indulge in burning stubble. ""Banning and penalising farmers will not help because how will you identify which farmer is burning crop? It's difficult. Plus the farmer is burning it out of compulsion. The government can support some mechanisation at the village level for taking out the straw and then putting it to use by, say, composting it. The farmer should see economic value in the exercise,"" Ramanjaneyulu G V, executive director at Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, said at the conference organised by Global Strategic Communications Council. The government now gives subsidy on equipment to sow stubble in Punjab and Haryana.The paddy-wheat system leaves farmers with the sowing time of less than a month between the two crops, pointed out Umendra Dutt of Punjab-based Kheti Virasat Mission. Mechanised harvesting and monoculture of wheat and paddy are also behind the problem of stubble burning. ""The cropping pattern should change. In Andhra, bean gram and black gram are planted while rice stubble decomposes on its own. The government should also procure pulses and oil seeds which are suitable for north India. The problem of stubble burning will never be solved otherwise,"" added Ramanjaneyulu. He explained that the amount of stubble generated is higher than the harvest. Every four tonne rice or wheat leave behind about six tonne straw. Nearly five-seven tonne straw per hectare stay unused. Just one tonne of straw burning can release up to 3kg particulate matter (PM), 1,460kg carbon dioxide (CO2) and 199kg ash. While Delhi and the rest of the NCR are exposed to severe levels of pollution, burning also leads to an immediate decline in the bacterial and fungal population in the top 2.5cm of the soil. Repeated burning permanently diminishes the bacterial population by more than 50%, increasing farmers' dependence on fertlisers and pesticides. ""The government subsidises nitrogenous and other fertilisers. Burning stubble in Punjab is equivalent to wasting subsidies worth Rs 500 to Rs 1500 crore,"" estimated Ramanjaneyulu.'Proof on health impacts'Sagnik Dey, associate professor at Centre for Atmospheric Sciences in IIT Delhi, said several studies in India showed that air pollution was strongly linked to severe health impacts like chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, heart disease and mortality. ""I think policy-makers are looking only at traditional journals,"" Dey said while answering a question on why the Centre is suspicious of reports linking air pollution and mortality. He quoted nearly 21 medical studies published from 1980 onwards by Indian physicians and scientists linking air pollution with upper respiratory symptoms in the 1980s and lower birth weight due to mothers' exposure to polluted air in the 2000s./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Dharavi potters get 27ft chimney for oven to escape smoke pollution,"MUMBAI: Seventy-five-year-old Darshee Laad has spent most of his life inhaling thick sooty smoke that emanates from his potter's oven at Kumbharwada in Asia's largest slum pocket of Dharavi. He may not have to endure the relentless air pollution for long, though, if a local initiative works out as planned.Laad is among 350 potters who recently welcomed a prototype 27-foot-high and six-foot-wide aluminum chimney for a potter's oven, to resolve the decades-long smoke menace. The chimney releases smoke high in the air, providing much-needed relief to potters. /In a first-of-its-kind endeavour at Kumbharwada, the potters collected funds and erected the chimney for one Dinesh Ramjibhai (48).Locals said this experiment will also pave the way for 150 ""deshi bhattis"" or traditional potter's ovens to be converted into modern electrical ones, which would considerably reduce pollution in the locality.""During the recent municipal corporation election, we were discussing the plight of locals when we learned about the smoke pollution that potters suffer. Independent candidate Paul Raphel raised funds and erected this model chimney, which was a success,"" said Mohammed Ayub Shaikh, a fabricator who designed the chimney. Paul lost the election to Shiv Sena candidate T Jagdish and the locals ran short of funds.Paul said the chimney, which is fitted with a high-speed exhaust fan, costs Rs 35,000. He said the potters would therefore require a government subsidy as well as soft loans to afford one.""Not only the residents of Dharavi, but even the entire Sion stretch, including Sion Hospital, is affected by the smoke. In the second phase, we plan to instal electric chimneys and convert the bhattis into electrical ovens. The pollution level in the densely populated Dharavi and its surrounding areas will subsequently reduce. We need the government's support for the purpose,"" said Paul. The potters use raw synthetic material from the textile mills of Bhiwandi as fuel as the environmentally friendly cotton is costly and scarce, which adds to the pollution. ""This sticky, sooty smoke not only affects our health but has even blackened our homes. We don't wear light coloured clothes,""' said one Ramilaben. Dr Rakesh Kumar, director, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), gave a thumbsup to the initiative. ""Emitting the gases at a higher altitude could definitely help."" He, though, added that the initiative can be further enhanced by installing an air-cleaning system in the chimneys. ""Of course, that would require more funding, space, water and electricity, but such a system can reduce the quality of particulate matter,"" he added. Sion Hospital that is located in close proximity of Dharavi and almost breathes the same polluted air has a busy chest department. But there are no numbers to suggest that people from Dharavi suffer from increased respiratory or lung diseases compared to the rest of the city./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
PM to open power plant not sticking to env rules,"Nagpur: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to dedicate to public on Friday thermal generation units that are functioning against the norms set by the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC). These units do not have the mandatory pollution control equipment. Experts TOI spoke to said that Mahagenco, the state-run power generation company which operates the units, or Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) have blatantly manipulated figures to show that air pollution levels are well within limits. ""This is endangering public health,"" they say.Air quality monitoring figures at stack (emission from chimney) of Koradi Thermal Power Station (KTPS) accessed by TOI show the recorded figures of concentration of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter (PM) are much below the permissible limits. The SO2 figures have been contradicted by a senior Mahagenco official himself. /As per the analysis report of stack monitoring, the concentration of sulphur dioxide is between the range 5.71-12.57 microgram per normal metric cube (microgram/NM3) between January and March this year. However, Nitin Wagh, chief engineer (environment), told TOI that SO2 level was above the permissible limit of 200 microgram/NM3. ""This is because we have not installed a flue gas desulphuriser (FGD) for the new unit numbers 8, 9 and 10. The tender will be floated within one month and we will meet MoEFCC norms by December 2017,"" said Wagh.The environmental clearance issued by MoEFCC to the project on January 4, 2010, said that Mahagenco was to install FGD for the new unit numbers 8, 9 and 10. The generation company, which had increased the project cost by Rs3,000 crore, refused to install a FGD saying the project cost would go up by Rs400 crore. This, in turn, would increase the power tariff.The MPCB, which goes by the rule book in case of small industries, turned a blind eye towards this violation and gave KTPS its consent to operate. Since 2015, TOI has reported this a few times.Research by India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has revealed high concentration of SO2 can lead to acid rain. Prolonged exposure to high SO2 level can also cause diseases like cancer.Data collected by IMD shows that Nagpur already receives acid rain. The frequency is likely to increase when the three new units start functioning at full capacity, especially if the FGD is not installed.Not only SO2 levels but particulate matter (PM) levels as mentioned in the air quality analysis report for stack are questionable. Seeing the kind of air pollution that is caused due to the plant, experts say that the figures seem ""relatively low"" and ""unrealistic"".Air quality monitoring for thermal power stations is done in two parts - ambient air (pollutants present in surrounding areas) and stack monitoring (pollutants emitted from the stack). As per the standards set by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the permissible parameter for total particulate matter (TPM) is 50 milligrams per normal metric cube for thermal power plants installed before January 1 this year.According to the analysis report of stack monitoring at KTPS for units 8 and 9, the TPM is well below the permissible limit. They range from 34.73 microgram/NM3 to 45.3 microgram/NM3. Environment experts however feel the data does not reflect the reality.Debi Goenka, executive trustee of Conservation Action Trust who also did a study on thermal power plants of the country, said that the figures seem unrealistic if the intensity of emission is taken into account. ""The monitoring done by MPCB is extremely poor and the pollution control measures that are actually in place are bypassed, creating a situation where the plant emissions are far above the permissible levels. But the figures can be manipulated on paper to make it lower,"" said Goenka.The environmental expert said that the MPCB many times relies on data provided by the industries itself. ""It's been found that the sensors and equipment are mostly not calibrated. Many industrial control rooms are computerized and the software they use is often manipulated to ensure the readings do not cross a pre-determined number,"" said Goenka.As per the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, the permissible limit for particulate matter of size 2.5 microns should be within 60 microgram per metre cube. As per the data available with TOI, in some areas near the Koradi plant, the respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) concentration was recorded as high as 210 microgram per metre cube.Residents living in Mankapur area, which is 10 kms from KTPS, complained about health problems caused due to emissions. ""We had kept a black cloth near the flyover in the night. It had turned nearly white by morning as it was completely covered in dust of the plant,"" they said. The figures also show that SO2 and NOx are well within permissible limits for both ambient and stack sensors. ""Gases have an advantage as they get diluted in air and thus figures can be low for ambient air. But figures for total particulate matter at the source of emission cannot be so low, considering the level of pollution and health problems faced by residents,"" said founder of Green Vigil Kaustav Chatterjee./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Koradi plant low pollution levels unrealistic. Fudged?,"Nagpur: Air quality monitoring figures at stack (emission from chimney) of Koradi Thermal Power Station (KTPS) accessed by TOI show the recorded figures of concentration of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter (PM) are well inside the permissible limits. However, according to a senior official of Mahagenco, the state-run company which operates the units, the SO2 levels are higher than the prescribed parameters.The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board is dependent on Mahagenco to provide air pollution data recorded periodically at different places around KTPS which is barely 7 kms from the city limits. It does no daily monitoring.Experts TOI spoke to said that either Mahagenco or MPCB are manipulating figures to show that air pollution levels are well within limits. ""This is endangering public health as people are inhaling polluted air,"" they say.As per the analysis report of stack monitoring available with TOI, the concentration of sulphur dioxide is between the range 5.71-12.57 microgram per normal metric cube (microgram/NM3) between January and March this year. /The permissible level is 200 microgram/NM3. However, Nitin Wagh, chief engineer (environment) of Mahagenco, told TOI that SO2 level was much more as per ""my knowledge"".

The cost of the units had gone up by Rs 3,000 crore form the original estimate. Saying installing the FGD (an equipment to reduce SO2 emissions) would escalate the cost by another Rs 400 crore, Mahagneco refused to install it. It also said the power tariff would go up and consumers would have to bear the burden.The MPCB, which strictly follows the rule book in case of small industries, turned a blind eye towards this violation and gave KTPS its consent to operate.

Kerala air quality goes up in smoke,"KOCHI: Data From Air Pollution Monitoring Stations Show High Suspended Particulate Matter . Quality of air in many parts of the state is getting worse every day resulting in severe health issues, but people are yet to make a connection between the two, health and environment experts said.Children remain the most vulnerable to air pollution, doctors said. This is since they breathe twice as quickly as adults which facilitates entry of small pollutant particles entering their lungs. Any incident of low immunity leads to worsening of their health.""Their air pipes are more porous and thus more vulnerable,"" said Dr Ramesh Kumar, national presidentelect, Environment chapter, Indian Academy of Paediatrics. /He said that it is not asthmatic children alone who are vulnerable. Pulmonologist Dr Vipin P V said that there is an increase in hospital visits by asthmatic patients and those with history of bronchial diseases. ""We are also seeing fresh cases of patients with respiratory problems,"" he said.According to the data collected by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), the months of January and February this year registered high levels of suspended particulate matter on many days.The respiratory suspended particulate matter (RSPM) is measured in two standards, PM 10 and PM 2.5, indicating the fine particles which remain in the atmosphere.""There is a cause for concern as most districts have seen a rise in levels from their earlier years. This increase also reflects the rising number of vehicles especially diesel vehicles. However, we do not have the necessary equipment to record PM 2.5 in most of our recording stations,"" said KSPCB chairman K Sajeevan.He said that Kochi city recorded the highest levels of air pollution in the state because of non-stop construction activity. ""There was construction activity by Kochi Metro and road re-laying. However, one of the reasons is the absence of road cleaning after construction activity has ended,"" Sajeevan said.While the normal limit is 60 gm\xB3, many districts have moved close to it on most days. Kochi recorded 159 gm\xB3 on a couple of days during the random sampling in the two months which is very high by all standards. Districts like Kozhikode, Kottayam, Thrissur and Alappuzha were close behind.Environmentalist CM Joy said that it is high time that the government constituted a committee of medical experts to look at the health issues that result from air and water pollution./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
PMO seeks report on Koradi plant irregularities,"Nagpur: The Prime Minister's Office has sought action on the various irregularities at the Koradi Thermal Power Plant. It has also asked for an action taken report in 15 days.The PMO was acting on a complaint filed by activist Ankita Shah whose grievance was based on TOI's report on April 16 -- 'Koradi plant low pollution levels unrealistic. Fudged?'/ She had registered the complaint on pgportal.gov.in/pmocitizen/Grievancepmo and Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS).The complaint was forwaded to the ministry of environment, forest and climate change which, in turn, sent it to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). In a letter dated April 17, Paritosh Kumar, Scientist 'E' of CPCB, issued directions to the member secretary of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to take appropriate action. ""It is requested that appropriate action be taken on the grievances and action taken report be sent to the applicant under intimation to this office within 15 days,"" the letter stated.Picking up several points from TOI's report, Shah in her complaint had drawn Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attention to the air pollution caused by the power plant, endangering health of thousands of people. Modi had dedicated to the nation three units of Koradi Thermal Power Station (KTPS) on April 14 during his visit to the city. TOI's investigations had revealed that the three units of KTPS, which have been in use since a year, are functioning against the MOEFCC norms. Unit numbers 8,9 and 10 have not installed flue gas desulphuriser (FGD), which is a mandatory pollution control equipment. Yet, surprisingly, the stack monitoring figures are much lower than the permissible parameters laid down by the pollution board.Seeing the kind of air pollution that is caused due to the plant, experts TOI spoke to said that the figures seem ""relatively low"" and ""unrealistic"".Referring to this, Shah in her complaint stated that monitoring done by MPCB was poor. She is happy with PMO's response. ""This is the first time that the PMO has taken prompt action after a complaint was filed by me. The matter concerns public health and should be taken seriously,"" said Shah.Research by India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has revealed high concentration of SO2 can lead to acid rain. Prolonged exposure to high SO2 levels can also cause diseases like cancer.Data collected by IMD shows that Nagpur already receives acid rain.

Vyttila & MG Road among most polluted points in Kochi,"KOCHI: MG Road, Ernakulam South and Vyttila continue to be among the most polluted points in the city . The air you breathe here could be the reason for the several breathing and allergic problems being reported among the children and elderly in the city .According to the Kerala state pollution control board data on continuous ambient air monitoring stations, the respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) which causes the particles to enter your airways and later into the lungs, is very high, almost double the normal levels.KSPCB officials said that construction activity and high vehicular intensity are among the main reasons for increase in the pollution levels. ""Vyttila is the only station where there is a real-time monitoring of air pollution levels. In all the other stations, recording are taken after looking at the various weather conditions so that it does not affect the actual readings,"" said K V M V Shanavas, senior environmental scientist, KSPCB central laboratory .The readings which were taken on six different days in the month and as many times in a day in January and February showed that the three stations recorded the levels varying from 159-120 micrograms per cubic metre on some days. /PCB officials said that there has not been any specific incident related to events on these days. Howe ver, with the roads being relaid and the Kochi Metro work gaining momentum, the pollution could get worse.However, environmentalists said that this may not be the actual picture. ""If one we re to travel along the main roads in Kochi, one can feel the pollution much before you even enter it. The sources of pollution are cement godowns, road repair, automobile exhaust, especially diesel which generates aerosols.While the large particles will settle down after some time, it is the fine particles that remain suspended,"" said environmentalist S Seetharaman.He said that these particles remain in the air for several days and years. Doctors have been recording increase in chronic cases of bronchial diseases.""If 1mm of airway is obstructed in an adult, it affects 16% of his breathing.

FIR against farmer for stubble burning,"NOIDA: In what is being touted as the first case of direct intervention by government machinery over an incident of stubble burning in UP, Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has filed an FIR against a farmer for allegedly burning wheat stubble in his 2.3 hectare agricultural field in Greater Noida.The complaint against the farmer, Rajpal, at Momnathal village in Sadar tehsil of Greater Noida, was filed at Knowledge Park police station.Akhilesh Tripathi, SHO, Knowledge Park police station, said the complaint will lead to a court summons and he would have to pay a fine for violating the ban on crop burning enforced by the National Green Tribunal (NGT). ""The complaint will lead to court proceedings. The fine, as applicable, is likely to be levied,"" Tripathi said. The district administration took the action in response to complaints filed on Saturday.In December 2015, NGT had banned burning of agricultural residue in Uttar Pradesh and all the neighbouring states of Haryana, post submission of photographs by ISRO depicting the extent of smoke cover over the fields of NCR in the post-harvest season. /The farmers traditionally burn the crop residue and use the ash as fertilizer.Stubble burning, however, is counted as one of the highest contributors to air pollution in NCR.With harvest season just over and several incidents of wheat stubble burning being reported from agricultural fields of Greater Noida, constant watch is being kept by the administration on the farmers who flout the ban.""We responded to an anonymous complaint and swift action was taken. We have been maintaining vigil in the fields so as to curb the practice. Anyone who wants to inform us about such incidents can call up the administration office,"" said an official at DM's office said.Vikrant Tongad, a Greater Noida-based environmental activist, hailed the administration's action. ""We have been complaining about crop burning and there are a lot of aerial photographs to prove the extent of damage that crop burning practice has on environment,"" he said. ""This is the first-ever case that we know of where an FIR has been lodged against a farmer in UP. Such strong action by the administration will lead to the end of this malaise,"" Tongad added./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Air pollution in India reducing solar power yield by 17-25%: Study,"India is making a big push for solar energy, with power capacity expected to double this year. But some of the gains, especially in north India, could be offset by a growing problem: air pollution.A new study, the first of its kind in India and one of a handful globally, has found that dust and particulate matter (PM) may be reducing the energy yield of solar power systems in north India by 17-25 per cent annually.Half this reduction comes from dust and particles deposited on the surface of solar panels and which forms a physical barrier to light entry, said Duke University professor Mike Bergin, who led the study. Researchers allowed panels to accumulate dust for a month. Most importantly, half the decline in energy yield came from ambient pollution--haze that reduces the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, a phenomenon known as solar dimming. /""This study thus shows that improving air quality can lead to a big improvement in solar energy yield,"" said Bergin. ""Cleaning panels is not enough.""Solar energy is the linchpin of the India's renewable energy mission with a target of 100GW of solar power capacity by 2022. The Indian government offers many concessions and incentives to the developers.Solar power plants depend on the availability of sunlight, or solar irradiance. Anything that obstructs sunlight from photovoltaic panels--whether cloudy skies or sand on the panels reduces potential energy generation. Some studies have looked at the impact of dust, especially in Middle Eastern countries. A 2016 study from Baghdad, for instance, found an 18.74% decline in efficiency for solar modules left uncleaned for a month. Another 2014 paper from Colorado, USA found that 4.1% light transmission was lost for every gm2 of dust accumulated on the photovoltaic plate.But air pollution has received less attention. In one rare study, researchers investigated the power output of ten photovoltaic sys tems in Singapore during a haze episode in 2013 due to forest fires in Indonesia. They found that poor air quality caused yield losses of 15\xAD25% in a 10-\xADweek period.Loss of irradiation in a single day peaked at nearly 50%, said Andre Nobre, lead author and head of operations at Cleantech Solar in Singapore. The study did not look at particulate deposits because frequent rain keeps solar panels clean in Singapore, he noted. ""For a city like New Delhi, you have the added effect [of] soiling on the panels from the fact that it is a much drier and dirtier city.""Bergin's study is the first to quantify the combined impact of ambient particles and deposited matter. Bergin and his colleagues analysed deposits on solar panels at the IIT campus in Gandhinagar, and tracked energy yield before and after cleaning. They then estimated change in solar panel transmittance per unit mass deposited, and developed a model.They found proportions of dust and pollution were roughly equal in north India. What fraction of dust was wind-blown and what was from human-activity was not analysed, noted Bergin, who previously looked at pollution's effect on the Taj Mahal.The solution for one part of the pollution problem is simple enough: frequent cleaning. Power generation jumped by on average of 50% after each cleaning, the study found.However, companies cannot control cloud cover or smog, noted Ashish Khanna, the ED & CEO, Tata Power Solar, and instead must ""anticipate plausible dips"" in irradiation.Air pollution is now a factor in business decisions, according to Nobre, whose company has solar projects across Asia including India. ""Developers like ourselves will be extra cautious when signing power purchase agreements with clients with facilities located in highly polluted zones,"" Nobre said. ""Our returns are impacted by air pollution, which in turn end up increasing electricity tariffs we are able to offer. As the fleet of PV systems is drastically growing in India, there could be millions of dollars in revenue being lost.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Delhi's air quality may improve as UP, Haryana, Punjab take steps to discourage stubble burning","NEW DELHI: Northern states are working on concrete steps to prevent large-scale crop burning that shrouds Delhi in a pall of black smoke and raises air pollution to a level that creates a health emergency and prompts people to wear surgical masks./Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh — which have the country’s most fertile fields —have initiated steps to discourage the low-cost but polluting farm practice and discussed the matter in a recent meeting between farm ministers of states and the Centre where strategies for the summer-sown kharif crop were discussed./The situation was so bad late last year that the Capital was referred to as a gas chamber by health experts, forcing authorities to declare holidays for schools and ask people to stay indoors. For farmers, burning the remnants from the previous crop is an easy and cheap option while preparing the fields to plant wheat, rice, pulses and sugarcane. With no alternatives to offer, authorities had mostly failed to convince them from stopping the age-old practice./The states have now sought subsidies from the Centre to procure machinery to gather crop remnants, as well as financial support to incentivise farmers to adopt modern residue management systems./Officials have also vowed to create awareness among farmers and enforce rules that prevent open burning of farm waste./“Stubble burning is a big challenge that we can overcome, by using it for cattle fodder, incorporate it in soil and compost it or use it as fuel in industrial units,” said Jasbir Singh Bains, director at Punjab’s agriculture department./“We have sought an assistance of Rs 1,600 crore from the Centre to buy machineries for farmers. Also, we have requested for Rs 350 crore to compensate farmers whose cost of cultivation increases in case of manual stubble harvest and another Rs 500 crore for diversification of crops.” Punjab will also focus on strict enforcement of rules./The state’s pollution control board will take action against farmers who don’t follow rules against burning of waste. The penalty will be Rs 2,500 for two acres of land, Bains said. “The transport department will not register new Combine harvesters — which harvest both wheat and rice — till it has an attachment of super straw management system to uniformly keep the loose straw,” he added./In Punjab, more than half of the 37 million tonnes of the rice and wheat residues it produces every year are burnt, according to the agriculture ministry. In Uttar Pradesh, the agriculture department is preparing a proposal seeking enhanced subsidy to procure machines that will help reduce farm wastes. “We will submit our proposal to the Centre by first week of May,” said AK Bihnoi, director at the state’s agriculture department./With a limited window between harvesting and planting of crops, open field burning of rice, pulses, sugarcane and wheat stubble was the norm, but it is changing because of increasing awareness about pollution, he said. Haryana, too, is seeking similar subsidies./“Collectively, various departments are working to ensure that farmers do not burn stubble. We will have to incentivise farmers for adoption of various residue management operations,” said Suresh Gahlawat, additional director of Haryana’s agriculture department. Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade analyst based in Chandigarh, doesn’t see any need for a central subsidy for such steps./“The only solution is that combine harvester manufacturers should make farm machines which enable chopping the plant stem from the base, and bundle the straw like a bailer does,"" he said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Manage asthma with these lifestyle changes,"With increasing pollution levels in the country and dust particles in the environment, it is no secret that the number of people suffering from asthma are rapidly increasing, especially in urban areas. According to World Health Organization, there are 15-20 million asthmatics in our country at present. Not just asthma, the increasing air pollution is also adding to the people complaining of breathlessness, unexplained coughing, tightening in the chest and wheezing.Asthma is a chronic breathing condition where your airways, or bronchial tubes become inflamed and narrow and thus, make it difficult for you to breathe. The difficulty for the air to move in and out of lungs triggers symptoms like coughing, shortness of breathe, tightening of chest and wheezing. /The symptoms are also triggered in response to some kind of allergens like dust, cigarette smoke, pollution, infection, pollens or hypersensitivity. Due to plenty of allergens in the atmosphere, a sensitive person can get an attack due to any of these allergens. It's not possible to eliminate all the allergens from the atmosphere, so one must be very careful of his/her surroundings and try to minimize the exposure to such triggers.People suffering from asthma must keep a record of allergens that trigger their condition, but if they don't know, it is always better to avoid some of the most common type of allergens. Some allergens and condition are mentioned below:- Physical activity for an extended period of time which might lead to shortness of breath.- Dust, mites, spores, pollen dust, cockroach feces, common cold and infections.- Cold and humid air- Smoke and fog- Stress and anxiety- Medication that may trigger the condition- Pollution from vehiclesThough asthma needs medical attention, there are certain lifestyle changes that can cut down your risk of aggravating the condition, i.e. asthma attack. Following are certain changes, which can help manage Asthma in a better way. These can be adopted to minimize or even eliminate the symptoms of the disease.- Stay away from pets: Animal fur, waste and urine are common allergens which can cause respiratory problems and lead to coughing and sneezing which can be a trouble for asthmatic patients. Keep your pets away from your bedroom and keeping them well-groomed and washed can help in minimizing the problem.- Use air purifier/AC with air filters: Using air purifier and air conditioners with filter will help to clean the indoor air and control allergens from entering your house. Air conditioner also minimizes humidity in the house. If your house is very humid, you can use a dehumidifier to make it better.- Use mask while travelling and cleaning: When you travel, there are a lot of allergens around you. So, to keep them at bay, use a pollution mask.- Clean your room and decor frequently: You should clean and sanitize your room and its decor frequently to avoid any dust build-up on them. Try to frequently replace your pillow covers, mattress, carpet and curtains as these items are the ones which contain most of the dust. Ensure no molds and fungal deposit are there inside the house. Stuffed toys and bedding should be washed in hot water every alternate day.- Don't use heavy fragrances and perfumes: Using very hard perfumes and fragrances is not a good idea for asthmatics. So, use mild and liter ones.- Make a list of eatables that trigger your asthmatic condition: Avoid food products which are known to trigger Asthma. Eatables like shelfish, cow milk, soy, peanuts, eggs and wheat may be allergens for some people. You need to identify yours and keep a track of which food triggers your condition.- Stay healthy: Do regular exercise, yoga and have a healthy diet. This will strengthen your heart and lungs and make your body more resistant to asthmatic attacks. A healthy and wholesome diet containing Vitamin C and E, beta-carotene, Omega fatty acids, antioxidants, magnesium, and selenium reduces the risk of asthma and boosts immunity.Inputs by:Dr. Mool Chand Gupta, Pulmonologist on Lybrate./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Passive smoking most common cause of asthma in kids: Doctors,"KANPUR: People should completely stop smoking at their homes to save their children from asthma. Also, carpets, doormats and mattress should be dusted outside the house so that dust particles are not inhaled by children, said doctors of Indian Paediatrics Academy (IPA) on the occasion of World Asthma Day on May 2. The doctors were addressing a continuing medical education (CME) programme at Ganesh Shankar Vidhyarthi Memorial (GSVM) medical college on the occasion.Dr Asish Srivastava, secretary, IPA said passive smoking has emerged as the most common cause of asthma in kids. In many homes people regularly smoke in the presence of their children. /Due to continuous exposure of smoke, several children fall prey to asthma, said the experts.Head of the Paediatrics department of GSVM medical college, Dr Yashwant Rao said around 30 crore people in the world are suffering from asthma and the number of patients in India is approximately three crore. In this total figure there are around 10 to 15 percent children, he added.Talking about high level of air pollution in the city due to industries, Dr Rao said people should take extra precautions where there is a change in weather. ""Wear a mask while moving out, avoid sitting with people who smoke, eat healthy food and do regular exercise,"" he suggested.Talking about the other causes of asthma and precautions, Dr Sunil Agarwal of IPA said one should take care of pets like dogs and cats as they have mites on their body which cause allergy and many a times lead to asthma, he added.The best way to help against asthma is to take precautions. There are many children who are genetically prone to asthma. If a child is regularly getting cold, cough and develops breathing disorder, it is the first alarming sign of asthma. Parents should consult a doctor immediately in such a case, said Dr Agarwal. Also a clean environment should be given to them so that problem does not aggravates, he added.He even laid emphasis on breastfeeding of newborns as it boosts the immunity of children and protect them against many medical problems including asthma./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"Crop fires reduced, Delhi air quality better this year","NEW DELHI/BHATINDA: There has been an increase in burning of wheat crop stubble in Punjab and Haryana this week compared with the previous one, Nasa's satellite pictures reveal. But the images also reveal a larger and more significant trend, the practice of crop-burning is down sharply in comparison with the same period last year.Reports from the ground suggest the two state governments' firm approach seems to be working but major challenges lie in the days ahead as angry farmers demand a viable alternative to the practice.Nasa's FIRM web fire mapper, which uses satellite imagery to map instances of fires on the ground, shows a marked reduction in 'fire spots' in the two states in 2017 over the previous year. The same eight-day period (April 27-May 4, both days included) was used to make the comparison.The practice of burning of crop stubble after the kharif (October-November) and rabi (April-May) seasons in the two states is seen as a major contributor to air pollution in the region, including Delhi-NCR.Air quality in Delhi is another indicator of reduced crop burning this year. A comparison of an eight-day AQI average (April 27-May 4, both days included) of 2016 and 2017 shows air in the capital this year has been far healthier than the last. /AQI during the period this year has been in the moderate zone (176) while it was 'very poor' last year at 307. Of course, weather conditions as well as raging forest fires in Uttarakhand also contributed to air pollution in Delhi last year. Last year's pattern, as seen in the satellite images, reveals that crop-burning peaked in the first week of May and started abating around May 12. This would suggest that there could yet be a spike in crop fires.There are mixed reports from the ground on crop-burning. ""Farmers are afraid to burn their wheat stubbles this year because of the administration's threat of action and fines,"" Ruby Singh Sandhu, a farmer from Ellenabad in northwest Haryana, said on phone.In Punjab, many farmers have been protesting against the tough orders on crop-burning. At many places, farmers have been openly defying the directions and burning the straw, despite the theat of cases and fines.Farmers are demanding a compensation of Rs 2,000 per acre and eight-hour power supply to help prepare the fields through farm machinery without burning straw. They have threatened to start burning wheat stubble collectively from May 10 if the demands aren't met.Wheat was sown in nearly 35 lakh hectares in Punjab and state expects a bumper harvest this year.The state pollution control board, agriculture department and the districts are keeping a watch over burning of straw through remote sensing. Nearly 200 farmers have been fined in various districts till May 3. On Thursday, seven farmers were fined Rs 17,500 for burning straw in Muktsar district.The state has fixed a fine of Rs 2,500 for burning straw in fields up to 2 acres, Rs 5,000 for farms up to 5 acres and Rs 15,000 for those over 5 acres. Most of the fines slapped so far have been on fields below 5 acres, said a state government official.""The Adesh institute of medical sciences and research (AIMSR) had in January 2016 carried out an extensive study to document the health impacts of stubble burning and found that smoke caused by burning of agriculture waste was adversely affecting the quality of life of farmers. It showed that nearly 85% people from all age groups suffered from one or the other health problems because of the smoke,"" said Vittul K Gupta, associate professor at AIMSR. An agriculture department official said the state government has offered up to 50% subsidy on various implements as an alternative to straw burning. ""We have even demanded suggestions from farmers for measures to be adopted to contain menace of straw burning,"" he said.While the next few weeks would be a challenge for the state administration, the bigger task will be to reduce fires after the kharif crop later this year.""Most of the wheat stubble is used for fodder. What remains is just a stalk that burns up fast or can be mixed with the soil with relative ease. Hotter weather in April-May also dispersed the smoke faster,"" said Sandhu.Burning of paddy stubble is much more widespread. And, it takes place in October-November, when colder weather results in smoke hanging in the air for longer and even travelling with air currents to Delhi-NCR and beyond./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
50% COPD patients are non-smokers,"NAGPUR: COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is commonly known as a disease of cigarette smokers. But, ongoing research at KRIMS Hospital suggests that 50% of COPD patients are non-smokers. The hospital claims this is the first clinical study in the country on COPD in non-smokers. /The study is drawing attention to the potential hazard of indoor air pollution, which can lead to COPD. In another section of the study, researchers are studying air pollutants inside the homes of non-smoking patients.KRIMS has collaborated with Dr Irfan Rahman, professor of environmental medicine at Rochester Medical Centre, United States, for the study. Rahman hails from Kamptee.According to the study, about 50% of COPD patients have never smoked a cigarette or bidi. Women accounted for 50% of all the COPD patients, with a big chunk of women being those who cook food on an open chulha or wood fire, which exposes them to smoke every day.The study aims to come up with standards to be followed during indoor cooking, and technologies needed to address indoor pollution. KRIMS consultant pulmonologist Dr Sameer Arbat, who is also part of the research team, said, ""We will be later forwarding the study to the government to formulate a policy. Dr Rahman will be helping us take the clinical research to the judicious level. He is already making similar efforts regarding environmental pollution in the United States.""The study on COPD began in February 2016, and the hospital plans to continue it for next two years. Dr Rahman, who stays in the US, keeps visiting the hospital every four months.Dr Rehman told TOI the ongoing research is in need of funds, and they have submitted a proposal to the central government to provide funds for the research to continue for two more years.Apart from this study, a profile based study of H1N1 patients too was conducted at KRIMS in association with Dr Rahman. During the swine flu outbreak in 2015, the hospital had treated 219 swine flu patients between December 2014 and March 2015, on whom the study was performed. The study was published in the Journal of Virus Medicine.The study showed that most swine flu patients were women, majority of them aged between 20 and 40, and most of them had a history of travelling. A common observation was that a number of them had diseases like diabetes and hypertension. Dr Arbat said, ""That's how it became easy to conclude that such patients can easily catch the virus.""/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

""Every praja darbar conducted in the constituency on Tuesday has been receiving many complaints about the increasing pollution levels,"" the MLA said, adding the problem should be solved immediately, else people will loose confidence on people's representatives./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"'Road dust big contributor to PM10, power plants to PM2.5'","AHMEDABAD : The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation had proposed to take up a study among the chronic respiratory patients to assess the impact of air quality in the city. The Air Information and Response Plan (AIRP), which was released on Friday, states that road dust is the major contributor to air pollution in Ahmedabad city.The AIRP states that a study found that the contributors to 10-micrometre particulate matter (PM10) pollution in the city was 30% road dust, 25% power plants, 20% motor vehicles, 15% industry, and the remaining 10% from domestic cooling, diesel generator sets, waste burning and construction.The study further found that the contribution breakup for PM2.5 in Ahmedabad was 31% from power plant, 27% transport, 11% brick kilns, 9% domestic cooking, 7% roads and 10% from diesel generators and waste burning.The AIRP stated that to focus on vulnerable groups, AMC has decided that apart from carrying out a study, it will also launch a school flag programme to display coloured flags corresponding to the air quality index for each day. The AMC has also decided to prepare a programme to sensitize community in areas where air quality is poor or very poor. /The AMC will also organize out asthma and pulmonary health clinics.The AMC, as a part of the AIRP, will appoint a nodal officer responsible for informing urban health centres and doctors when air quality turns poor, very poor or severe. The AMC also plans to send SMS alerts about air quality in the city and in their area, to patients suffering from asthma and other lung-related diseases.According to the AIRP, the AMC this year will train medical and paramedical worker on the issue of air pollution and health and the measures required if air quality deteriorates from poor to severe. These medical practitioners will also help raise awareness.The AMC will start research on reducing air pollutant after identifying pollutants. The AIRP states that in case of severe pollution or an air health alert is issued, its health department will ensure that adequate supplies of medicine are available. The AIRP also says that the AMC's labour department make sure that health workers get masks and they are made to work outdoors only when air quality improves./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Suhana Safar at Pirana!,"AHEDABAD: The Safar-Air monitoring station for Ahmedabad's biggest dumpsite, Pirana, is ironically situated in one of the greenest lungs of the city - Gyaspur forestry plantation. The area surrounding the station is a virtual green island consisting of 30,000-odd trees. Predictably, the air quality of Pirana reported by the station is far from the reality.Since the Safar programme was launched by the AMC, till date, the android app has reported only once, on Friday morning, that the quality of air at Pirana was poor. /Most of the time, the app paints a rosy picture of Pirana. For example, on Saturday, at 7am, the air quality index read 90 - a good quality. The advisory for Pirana stated the air quality is satisfactory and air pollution poses no risk.Residents of the area claim that if AMC was so concerned about the quality of air, it should have installed the station near the Pirana dump site which has 64-lakh metric tonnes of garbage. ""We know this smoke coming out of Pirana dump site is more dangerous than any vehicle or any other pollution,"" says Iqbal Saiyed, a resident of Pirana area. ""Lakhs of citizens living beyond Chandola, and towards Narol, experience burning sensations in their eyes, and uneasiness while breathing,"" he said.The Safar-Air programme was launched by the ministry of earth sciences, AMC and the Indian Institute of Public Health in Ahmedabad on Friday.Apart from Pirana, two stations were set up at Space Application Centres in Bopal and Satellite. Officials in AMC pointed out that almost all stations have been set up are in greener and cleaner areas.At 4pm, a thick smoke from the Pirana mound blankets some three square kilometres. Your eyes burn and visibility is not more than 20 feet but if one looks at the Safar app, the air quality index is 103 which was only three points higher than the normal range. The installation of the station, and the data, would help the AMC in the ongoing case in the high court, said disgruntled citizens.Radheshyam Baranda, who works in the area near the Gyaspur plantation, says, ""We are not aware where this machine is installed. If it is installed in this forest, it would not give a perfect reading.""

During the wheat and paddy harvesting seasons, farmers burn the stubble of the crops, which also increases the pollution./Unfortunately, the district had no air pollution measuring equipment so far./Giving details, Rai said, “Our board is very keen to install air pollution measuring instruments in the city. We have prepared a plan for the installation of the instruments at key spots.”/“After setting up the instruments, we will monitor them and study the area where air pollution is the high. These instruments will definitely prove very useful for us, as they will keep us updated about the pollution level in the area.”/According to Anuj Singh, a resident of a colony on Nagina Road, “Bijnor sugar mill is located on the border of the city. Mill, which emits ash with smoke, creates respiratory and eyes problems for the city’s people every year during the crushing season./“Surprisingly, a system to prevent ash was installed in the factory years ago, but mill administration keeps it off. Many parts including Adarsh Nagar, Mill Colony, Rasidpur, Adampur, ITI and Haidil are around the mill.”/For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
It's not just your lungs that are losing out to pollution,"NEW DELHI: Is there a link between pollution and autoimmune diseases? Researchers from AIIMS plan to undertake a detailed study in this regard.Dr Uma Kumar, professor and head of rheumatology department at the institute told TOI the project was necessitated by shocking results of a pilot study conducted by them to assess correlation between flaring of symptoms in patients of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an auto-immune disease that causes debilitating pain in joints, and pollutants. ""In 2013, we took out data of 500 RA patients seeking treatment at AIIMS. /Retrospective analysis of their clinical history and the area they lived in revealed that frequency of joint pain was higher when the level of pollutants such as PM 2.5 and PM 10 peaked. Also, those living near main road had persistent pain in the joints,"" Kumar said. She added that the same patients were followed prospectively-from 2014 to 2015-and the researchers found the same pattern in terms of link between pollution and aggravation of RA symptoms. The AIIMS professor said nearly 18% of healthy individuals were found to have evidence of sub-clinical autoimmunity. Simply put, these people did not have autoimmune disease, but markers of autoimmune disease like rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. In the new study, for which government has approved over Rs 75 lakh, the researchers will try to explore cellular changes caused by pollutants that are leading to autoimmune diseases. ""We will assess DNA changes and oxidative stress levels in 600 healthy individuals living in polluted and less-polluted areas. In Delhi, 400 people will be picked up from within 200 metres of monitoring stations that record high pollution levels. Another 200 people will be taken in Palampur in Himachal Pradesh where the air is cleaner,"" Kumar added.RA is a systemic autoimmune disease that primarily targets joints leading to progressive joint erosions. While 50%-60% of the RA cases have family history, the rest don't, which is why researchers are trying to explore other preventable causes. Pollution is one of them.Globally, there have been multiple studies to find a link between pollution and RA, but no conclusion has been reached so far. A review published in the 'Journal of Inflammation' in 2015 looked at multiple studies on this which propounded that pollutants can trigger RA by causing local lung and systemic oxidative stress along with hypovitaminosis (vitamin deficiency) D. ""Traffic, a surrogate of air pollution, has been associated with incidence of RA. Whether this environmental factor is casually associated with RA across populations is still a matter of debate,"" the review concluded. AIIMS researchers said they will be able to deliver that. The incidence of RA in India is estimated to be 0.75-1% of the total population. Kumar said till about a decade ago the rheumatology OPD had a waiting time of up to six weeks and it has now gone up to four months, reflecting the trend of increased incidence apart from more diagnosis./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Bhopal Tree Cover Chopped By 44% In 20 Years,"Bhopal: Bhopal: Unbridled urbanization is turning green Bhopal into a concrete jungle. The massive growth of highrises, glass-fa\xE7ade buildings, and vehicles is in direct contrast to the rate at which trees are vanishing.No wonder you hear Bhopal old-timers mourn 'how green was my city'. It's every bit true. And painfully so.According to a satellite survey conducted by Indian Institute of Science, Bhopal's tree cover was shorn by 44% - from a lush 66% to a mere 22% - over the last 20 years. What's worse, it could go down by another 11% in the city by 2018, fear experts.The effects are clear - summers are hotter. /Bhopalis recall that even 10 years ago, the nights were so cool even in May that you needed a light bedsheet to cover yourself.One of the key factors in this is the rise in population - from just 3.7 lakh in 1971 to 10 lakh in 1991, and 23 lakh in 2011. If you take the population of the city outskirts, it's easily around 29 lakh, according to the 2011 Census.According to Manoj Singh Mik of CREDAI, ""The population of Bhopal has risen, but the increase is on a downward slope. It grew by 5.88% between 1971 and 1981, by 4.39% between 1981 and 1991, 3.22% between 1991 and 2001 and by 2.60% in the next decade.""What this growth in numbers leads to is an increased demand for houses, appliances and vehicles, points pout Rama Umesh Pandey, professor of School of Planning and Architecture. ""With the increase in population, urban-life demands for houses, amenities and transport lead to felling of trees. The climate has been adversely affected. Concrete houses and glass surfaces absorb heat during the day and release it at night. Therefore, the heat remains trapped in the atmosphere and generates unusual discomfort. This process is called the heat island effect,"" Pandey said.Another alarming result of the heat-island effect is that the gap between minimum and maximum temperature reduces. Which is why summer discomfort is getting worse and nights are hotter than they were 15 to 20 years ago, she added.According to an alarming finding by Environmental Planning & Coordination Organisation (EPCO), by 2050, the average temperature will shoot up across India by 1.8-2 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature will rise by 2-2.4 degrees. And by the end of the century, the average temperature will increase by 3.4-4.4 degrees Celsius, and minimum temperature by 4.4 degrees. There will be 35% more monsoon rain and there will be an increase in winter precipitation as well.According to a 2005 CREDAI report, there has been a 9% decline in construction of bamboo, mud and unburnt brick houses across India between 1991 and 2011. Bhopal hasn't escaped this. ""This has caused the heat to expand in the lowest atmosphere,"" Singh said. This adds to the heat island effect.Perhaps the biggest culprit in the rising heat is the growth in vehicles and air-conditioners. ""Bhopal has roughly 13 lakh vehicles. And, every day we issue 120 to 130 new registrations. This increase is alarming as the atmosphere is degrading by the day. Sound and air pollutions are major threats,"" said Rajesh Sharma of the regional transport office (RTO).To add to the problem, enforcement of emission laws isn't very strict. It's common to see vehicles belching thick black smoke on Bhopal's streets. ""We levy hefty fines whenever we catch them. The black smoke is full of carbon dioxide, soot and micro-dust particles. It's very harmful, especially for children. The impact shows later in life in the form of incurable ailments. The poisonous gas also impacts aquatic life. Unfortunately, lack of awareness gives a free run to violators. It's high time we changed that,"" Sharma said.GFXBhopal' Green LossTree cover chopped from 66% to 22% in 20 yearsBy 2018, tree cover will dip by another 11%Population grew from 3.7 lakh in 1971 to 23 lakh in 2011Population growth5.88% from 1971 to 19814.39% from 1981 to 19913.22% from 1991 to 20012.60% from 2001 to 2011Trapped In Heat IslandRising population leads to increasing demand for houses, vehicles and electronic appliances.

Alkalize your body,"It is easy to get lost in the whole health-food terminology and discourse on clean living. One can't really tell where healthy stops and unhealthy begins! One major factor in determining the healthfulness of a food can be by looking at it from an alkaline or acidic point of view. /The more alkaline it is, the better. ""Alkaline diets have gained more importance from the cancer world, as many research studies are now showing an obvious connection between acidic diets and rise in cancers,"" says Dr Anjali Hooda Sangwan, consultant - obesity, metabolic medicine and clinical nutrition.Alkaline balanceIn order for your blood to effectively act as a medium of oxygen and absorb vital nutrients, your body's pH (potential of hydrogen) balance needs to be maintained. This equilibrium is essentially the body's alkaline-acid balance, which is ensured by healthy kidneys. Our packaged-food living makes us consume too much acid apart from already acidic dairy, grains, meats, and sugar. This puts too much load on the kidneys and they start accumulating the acid in our tissues. It also means that the body's mineral reserves such as calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium can run dangerously low. One needs to minimise the acid generation by eating more alkaline foods.The bigger pictureThe pH of our body is 7.4 and anything that alters the pH will make the body's immune defence go down and obviously open up the door for diseases. ""Sodium and sugar rich diets from processed foods can cause an upheaval in pH and lead to a disturbing health condition called acidosis,"" adds Dr Sangwan. Dr Robert Young, in his book The pH Miracle, says, ""Health depends on an internal alkaline environment. He discusses the importance of regulating your body's acid/alkaline chemistry and how it can result in weight loss, increased stamina and strength, and a stronger immune system."" Mind you, it's not just the food we eat that can cause an acidic environment, our body also creates acid by overusing muscles, breathing, and digesting certain foods. Other factors can be stress, toxins, air pollution, tobacco, lack of sleep, or medications.Eating rightAll foods have the ability to change your pH levels. Acidic foods are the culprit, but one can't and needn't just eat alkalizing foods. ""Consuming good fats like avocado, nuts, ghee and coconut oil are better than saturated fats. Processed animal protein, wheat and some grains increase the pH of the body, so the servings shouldn't cross more than two a day,"" says Dr Sangwan, adding, ""A balance of 80% alkaline-forming food and 20% acidic-forming food is ideal.""Chewing is an easy first step to make your food alkaline. Chew 30-40 times a bite. Be careful not to overeat and overload your system./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Breathe easy at airport with 4 air pollution controllers,"PUNE: The next time you stand outside the airport, don't fret about toxic fumes of vehicles passing by. Four outdoor air pollution controllers have been installed outside the terminal area to tackle air pollution. The funnel-shaped machines with a height of 4.5 feet suck in polluted air, filter it and then release fresh air, said Amol Chaphekar, the managing director of Pune's StrataEnviro Private Limited, the company which installed them. /Chaphekar told TOI that the airport authorities provided them with the electrical connection and the machines were installed as a pilot project. ""The manufacturing cost of these machines is around Rs80,000. But we have installed them for free in the airport area as a pilot project. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) officials helped us in this and in the near future we plan to install more such machines in and around the airport. We have worked in the city earlier and have installed these machines in the Pimpri Chinchwad area,"" he said.The four air pollution controllers have been installed in front of the terminal building, witnessing heavy vehicular movement during the peak morning and evening hours. An official at the airport, requesting anonymity, said he was impressed by the machines.""They will be formally inaugurated in a week's time. We felt the need of installing these machines. We hope they will bring down the pollution in the area. Based on the performance, more such machines can be installed in other places around the airport,"" the official said.The pollution-level surpasses the permissible limit in the peak hours outside the airport terminal. ""The pollution range is between 118-183 micro gram/cubic metre when there is PM2.5/PM10 in the air. We are positive that the machines will reduce the pollution,"" Chaphekar said.An airline staffer on duty at a counter outside the terminal building said things were really bad.

Stifled for breath: Hyderabad chokes on polluted air in 13 locations,"HYDERABAD: Its official, the city's air is unfit for breathing. The Air Quality Index maintained by the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) shows that there are 13 areas in the city where air pollution has crossed the threshold limit.So much so that the board has admitted that the air in these areas can cause breathing discomfort to people with lung and heart ailments.The areas are Balanagar, Uppal, Jubilee Hills, Paradise, Charminar, Jeedimetla, Madhapur, MGBS, Rajendranagar, Nizampet, Pashamylaram, Bollaram, Nacharam and ICRISAT, suffer from poor or bad air quality, say PCB officials.However, long-suffering residents of these areas rue that despite repeated attempts and protests to highlight their plight, the officials of the PCB have done little to improve the situation.According to Dr A Durga, a resident of Fatehnagar which is just a stone's throw away from Balanagar, the air in the area has turned hazy because of the smoke emitted by vehicles.""Many people in the colony have begun to develop skin problems and a persistent cough. The pollution in the air is evident, as we can literally see the pollutants float in the air. /We have tried speaking to the pollution control board and other concerned civic authorities but all our efforts have been in vain,"" she said. Even the city's green brigade has raised an alarm over the deteriorating air quality.""Most of the city's air is filled with vehicle exhaust fumes, a result of adulterated fuel. The civic authorities too are compounding the situation by burning garbage out in the open,"" said Dr S Jeevanand Reddy, a city based environmentalist.He said the state government should improve the public transport system, which could reduce the number of privately owned vehicles on the roads. A solution, to this fuming problem, he said was to open the completed metro rail stretches for commuters.""The government is using the metro rail as a poll plank. If they open this route for the general public it would help solve half the problem"" he said.PCB officials said that there has been a considerable rise in the pollution levels owing to the movement of heavy vehicles in places like Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station, Madhapur, Bollaram, Nacharam and ICRISAT.""Apart from these areas, the constructions taking place across the city are also contributing to the rise in air pollution."" said N Raveendhar, a senior scientist with the board./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
'60% traffic cops have weak vision',"Navi Mumbai: The recently held free health checkup and medical camp for traffic department staff has revealed that a majority of traffic cops are facing health issues pertaining to eye sight, blood pressure and lungs related ailments. After undertaking various medical tests of 455 staff of the traffic department, including 30 traffic inspectors, it has been revealed that 60% of them are suffering from weak eyesight. While another 44% have hypertension and another 22% have respiratory ailments. /The ones suffering from lungs related ailments are those who are constantly exposed to vehicular smoke during duty hours on the streets. While, the Body Mass Index (BMI) test has revealed that 20% of them are over weight.DCP (traffic) Nitin Pawar said, ""The traffic constables are suffering from weak eyesight as it is age related health problem as most of them are above 40 years of age. The doctors have claimed that the eye related problems in traffic cops occur as they do not use dark goggles to protect eyes from sunlight. While, the hypertension amongst traffic cops is due to physical and mental stress related to work. Hence, it has been advised to regularly conduct stress management and yoga sessions for mental and physical fitness respectively.""He said, ""The respiratory ailments amongst the traffic cops is mostly due to air pollution by automobiles exhaust smoke. The traffic cops deployed at toll plazas are more prone to respiratory ailments due to continuous exposure to vehicular smoke and pollution on the city streets. Even though masks are provided to the traffic cops, they do not use it continuously as they have to even communicate using walkie talkie. The doctors even said that yet another factor that contributes to lungs related disorder is smoking cigarettes and chewing tobbacco. Hence, it will be ensured that those addicted will quit these bad habits. The doctors have even given them tips of lungs related exercise which will help the cops stay healthy.""He further said, ""For physical fitness of the police department staff, there is proposal of setting up modernised and well-equipped gymnasiums with library attached, one in each of the two zones.

Villagers to meet CM for Bandhwari plant shift,"GURUGRAM: At a meeting between Bandhwari villagers and environmentalists on Friday, the former decided to meet the chief minister and demand the Bandhwari waste treatment plant (WTP) be relocated from the ecologically sensitive Aravalis.Bandhwari resident Mangar Tanwar said, ""We're going to meet both the chief minister and the MCG commissioner to demand immediate removal of the WTP from Bandhwari. It's a constant source of stench, diseases and groundwater pollution.""Villagers also said they are going to invite government officials to live in their villages. ""Gurgaon and Faridabad sends tonnes of waste to our forest. /We conserved it for hundreds of years, but authorities have now ruined it. Meanwhile, the plant is lying defunct for four years,"" said another villager, requesting anonymity. Situated over 32 acres, the plant has been collecting over 1,100 tonnes of waste as landfill from Gurgaon and Faridabad every day, since it stopped working in 2013. The authorities have recently allotted a tender to operate a waste-to-energy plant at the site.Some villagers were unhappy with the Chinese waste-to-energy plant planned to be installed by MCG at Bandhwari. ""Authorities are destroying our children's future, as the plant will cause a lot of air pollution. Health of our future generation is at stake. Why do authorities want to conduct such experiments in our villages?"" asked Dhanush, another villager.Activists assured all support to the villagers.

Delhi doesn't come close to meeting US pollution standards on most days,"New Delhi: The annual average PM2.5 concentration in Delhi is typically more than 10 times the US National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 12 micrograms per cubic metres. Such poor air quality has significant economic and health impacts (e.g., heart attack, asthma, lung cancer, mortality) and India needs to initiate PM 2.5 speciation and epidemiological studies to control sources effectively- this was the outcome of four workshops held in Delhi, Chandigarh, Jaipur and Lucknow last year by Indian and American scientists and US assembly officials.These workshops were part of an agreement on climate change between the two countries that was inked when US President Barack Obama visited India in 2015. The aim was to reduce air pollution in Indian cities, particularly Delhi. Recently, the recommendations of this coalition was published by the US-based Air and Waste Management Association. But now with a marked change in the Trump government's policies towards climate change, scientists aren't sure whether this cooperation will continue. /It's also not clear whether the US Environment Protection Agency (EPA), which has been facing staff cuts under the current government, will continue with such a project. The above-mentioned workshops had participation from Indian government officials, industry representatives, scientists, NGOs and US scientists. Scientists found that PM2.5 concentrations between January and December 2016 averaged around 138 micrograms per cubic metres. Approximately 84% of the days experienced PM2.5 levels that were unhealthy for sensitive populations; 67% of the days experienced PM2.5 levels that were in the unhealthy range for all population; and 13.5% of the days saw PM2.5 levels that were in the hazardous conditions as defined by the AQI scale in US. The discussions found that while Global Burden of Disease Study led to several initiatives but epidemiological studies had not driven the air pollution control policy in India. ""One of the major gaps identified is a lack of high-quality air quality and health effects data that are accessible and archived. CPCB maintains a network of approximately 342 stations that monitors sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and PM 10, and plans to expand it to include PM2.5. There is currently no routine PM2.5 speciation programme in place in India,"" the report added. Scientists found that there was no comprehensive national-level emission inventory system currently in place. ""New regulations implemented in 2016 require 17 industrial sectors to install continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) with features to transmit data in real-time to CPCB, and to automatically alert regulators in the event of an emission exceedance. Such measures are being initiated by CPCB, although the lack of sufficient resources appears to limit their ability to fully address the problem, including full implementation and follow-up."" The team recommended that the ministries of health and environment coordinate and formulate policies considering the effects of air pollution on human health and that air quality standards be defined based on epidemiological studies specifically from India. ""It was also recommended that CPCB should consider adding a PM2.5 speciation network to enable tracking air pollution and its composition over time and help link pollutants to sources. Lack of good data quality undermines the value of the data and trust of the public,"" the report added. Finally, they said the Indian government should consider expanding its initiative on ""Digital India"" to include an online data portal for air quality and health data. ""We have made our recommendations. Now, we are not sure if or how these will be implemented or whether studies will continue,"" said professor Manju Mohan of Centre for Atmospheric Sciences at IIT Delhi who is also the India lead on the Indo-US project.Another US-based scientist, who was part of the project briefly, said: ""It's unlikely that there will be anymore funding for his project from US. But cooperation with US EPA would have been important in putting control systems in place.""

Death toll from respiratory diseases rising in Gurgaon amid soaring pollution,"Gurgaon: The number of deaths from respiratory ailments being reported by hospitals in Gurgaon is rising year-on-year with the city's consistently high levels of air pollution seen as the exacerbating factor, according to medical practitioners. According to the data collected by TOI, 2,500 people admitted to five leading private hospitals in the city died in the last one year - from April 2016 to March 2017 - because of respiratory illnesses in which air pollution was an aggravating factor. The number of deaths reported in the previous year - from April 2015 to March 2016 - was 1,750, and in 2014 it was stated to be 1,530. A comparison of these numbers brings one to a ballpark estimate of a 30% rise in number of fatalities in 2016-17 compared with 2015-16. However, this is only based on data shared by these hospitals. An accurate picture can only emerge once a comprehensive city-wide survey is undertaken. /The patients who died had been diagnosed with respiratory illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, lung cancer, pneumoconiosis, anthracosis, silicosis, silicotuberculosis, berylliosis (a chronic lung disease), sinusitis, acute bronchitis, adenocarcinoma and ischemic heart. Air pollution has an exacerbating effect on almost all these diseases, not to mention the risk of triggering asthma in vulnerable, or even fit, people.An increase, according to doctors, has also been witnessed in the number of patients undergoing the pulmonary function test (PFT) that measures efficiency of lungs to transfer oxygen into blood. While a total of 5,986 people underwent this test in these five private hospitals in 2015, the number increased to 6,772 in 2016. This year, the number touched 7,000 by June.Around 50% of those who had undergone PFT in two private hospitals were diagnosed with functional impairment of lungs, while 20-30% patients were found to be suffering from lung impairment in the other three hospitals.Dr Himanshu Garg, a senior pulmonologist at Artemis hospital, said doctors had seen an unusual increase in respiratory diseases in the city this year, even during monsoon, when rains have a mellowing effect on pollution. ""The number of people with respiratory ailments is continuously rising every year. Earlier, most pulmonologists used to take leave during monsoon as footfall dipped during this time of the year. But this year, we have so far conducted at least 400 PFTs a month and are witnessing unusually high numbers of patients with respiratory illnesses at the OPD,"" he said. Dr Manoj Goel, director and head of department (pulmonology and sleep medicine) at Fortis Memorial Research Institute (FMRI), said a survey conducted by the hospital on lung capacity of bureaucrats in Gurgaon was an eye-opener. ""Around 68% employees of the Gurgaon administration reported shortness of breath in varying degrees, according to the 2015 survey. PFTs were done on 100 bureaucrats from Gurgaon. The survey revealed that even those sitting in air-conditioned offices are severely affected,"" he said.Garg also said there had been 5-10% rise in reporting of inflammatory markers such as neutrophil, eosinophil and alveolar macrophages during sputum tests compared with last year. ""Sputum analysis is a new clinical tool to diagnose obstructive airway diseases such as asthma, COPD, etc. Presence of inflammatory markers in sputum indicates ill-effects of air pollution on human health,"" he said.Talking about the effect of air pollution on the heart, Dr Upendra Kaul, a Padma Shri-winning cardiologist, said, ""Fine and minute particles, especially those less than PM 2.5 (size of 2.5 microns or lesser), are very harmful for health. These particles pass through filters of lungs and enter the blood, leading to excessive clotting and damage to vessel walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart and brain. This can lead to angina (chest pain), heart attacks and brain strokes.""Earlier this year, a study on global air pollution by the US-based institutes claimed India's worsening air pollution caused some 1.1 million premature deaths in 2015 and the country now ""rivals China for among the highest air pollution health burdens in the world"".The special report - State of Global Air 2017 - on 'global exposure to air pollution and its disease burden' noted that the number of premature deaths in China caused by dangerous fine particulate matter -PM2.5 - has stabilised in recent years but has risen sharply in India. It also said that both countries together were responsible for over half the total global attributable deaths, and that India had registered an alarming increase of nearly 50% in premature deaths from particulate matter between 1990 and 2015./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"10 years on, subsidy to fit autos with LPG kits yet to be released","CHENNAI: Despite Chennai being the third largest city in India with high air pollution, the state government has not thought it fit to release subsidies for autorickshaws plying on the city's roads to convert to LPG from petrol, said the CAG report. LPG as a fuel is considered cleaner than petrol.""The indecision of the state government in non-release of subsidy has affected the conversion of petrol driven autorickshaws to LPG vehicles,"" said the CAG report.Despite a government order in April 2007, a decade later the government still has not made any leeway. As per the original plan, autorickshaws were to install LPG kits with new permits following subsidies given by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) for each conversion.In November 2008, a TNPCB high-level committee suggested that the green tax collected from old vehicles be used for granting subsidies. /""Even though Rs 136.13 crore has been collected by the state as green tax, such conversions have not been effected,"" the CAG said.The government has sought to follow the methods of the Delhi government in getting more petrol-driven autos to switch to LPG in December 2016. A report is awaited in this regard. ""Since the emission of smoke from motor vehicles is a major source of air pollution, the delay in implementing the scheme has contributed to continued air pollution, beyond permissible limits,"" said the CAG.But a problem with large scale adoption of LPG vehicles is the lack of infrastructure, say dealers. India has about 56,190 fuel outlets of which 1,073 stations distribute LPG, according to data with Indian LPG Auto Coalition. When it comes to Tamil Nadu, in total the state has 4,702 petrol pumps of which only 148 stations have LPG.""For large scale adoption, we must have infrastructure and availability of fuel in place. Indian Oil has more than 2,000 petrol pumps in the city, but very few cater to the LPG segment,"" said an Indian Oil spokesperson./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
"CAG flays power plants for air pollution, fly ash","CHENNAI: Black lung disease or coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) might no longer be a condition restricted to workers given that tonnes of fly ash are being indiscriminately dumped in the open by the state's thermal stations. The CAG report points to as much as 69.58 million tonnes of ash lying undisposed by the PSUs against the government guidelines.Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) was found to have spent less than 10% (`61.91 crore) of its revenue of `625.93 crore allocated for disposal of fly ash. This is despite the MoEFCC guidelines that it should earmark the entire sum. /Another cause of concern is the power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. ""According to the ministry of environment norms suspended particulate matter (SPM) should not exceed 150 milligrams per cubic metre (mg/Nm3). But SPM levels at all five units in Tuticorin and in similar units in Mettur and north Chennai thermal power plants were above the permissible levels,"" said the CAG report. Doctors warn that continuous exposure to these gases and fly ash could lead to a range of ailments from chronic lung disease to asthma and cancer. ""These gases and fly cash can irritate the mucus membrane. It can irritate the lining of the wind pipe and nose causing sinusitis, bronchitis, asthma, wheezing and chest tightness. Prolonged exposure would lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammation of nasal passage, blockage and excessive secretion of mucus. In extreme cases it may also lead to lung cancer and pleural cancer,"" said Dr Sridhar R, a city-based pulmonologist.The CAG report notes that ""dust particles emitted while processing coal contains metals such as lead, mercury, nickel, tin, and others that could cause health problems with prolonged exposure. In the past five years, the three thermal plants have consumed 82.71 million tonnes of coal and generated 25.81 million tonnes of ash. The plants also emitted 112.07 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, 1.12 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide and 3.3 million tonnes of nitrogen oxides./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Stench playing spoiler for Bandhwari bachelors,"GURUGRAM: Youths in Bandhwari, a village on the Gurgaon-Faridabad border, have been struggling to find a prospective match for marriage with stench from a defunct waste management plant turning out to be a major spoiler.Villagers claim that the 32-acre landfill, which receives over 1,100 tonnes of garbage from Gurgaon and Faridabad daily, is fast emerging as a social crisis, sending out enough hints as to how environmental issues are impacting most aspects of human life.A TOI team visited the area and found out that at least 10 girls turned down marriage proposals from young men of the village recently simply because they do not want to spend the rest of their lives amid air, soil and water pollution that threaten serious health hazards.According to the villagers, there are around 200 bachelors here who are hunting for brides without any luck. Apart from spreading diseases and contaminating groundwater, the defunct plant off the Gurgaon-Faridabad road is now also undermining the eligibility of unmarried men.Twenty-three-year-old Nitish's fiancee called off their engagement after her family visited the village. ""My nephew got engaged in January. /After the engagement, we invited the bride's family to attend a wedding here. During their visit, the family raised serious concerns about the constant stench coming out of the plant. Two days later, the girl turned down the marriage proposal,"" Gajraj, Nitish's uncle, told TOI.""It has become a big problem for youths here. Reports of rising diseases, groundwater contamination and air pollution have spread to villages across Haryana. Nobody wants to marry off their daughters into a family in this village. Also, there has been a sharp rise in cases of cancer, kidney and liver failure, and skin disease. Why will a girl make this village her home?"" said Mangal Tanwar, a Bandhwari resident. He led a group of villagers to meet an NGT panel last month, demanding relocation of the waste plant.Many youngsters have migrated to other villages and cities while those, who are still living here, are planning to move out. ""I am well settled in transport business and earning enough here. But I have decided to move out of the village, to get married and live happily. Many of my friends have already left,"" said Shruti (22), another bachelor. Raje (40), whose husband Shyamvir is suffering from throat cancer, will never recommend any girl from her village (Baliawas) for marriage into a house at Bandhwari. ""Stench has become a part of our life. We always keep our nose covered, still we cannot avoid it. Children fall sick every now and then,"" she complained.Now, the villagers are worried about a proposed waste-to-energy plant to be set up by a Chinese firm here. ""We were living here peacefully, co-existing with the wildlife of the Aravalis. However, Bandhwari waste treatment plant came up in 2007 as a curse. The Chinese waste-to-energy plant will cause massive air pollution and destroy the village completely,"" said Balbir, another resident.An environmentalist, Vivek Kamboj, has already moved NGT, demanding relocation of the plant which lies in the ecologically-sensitive Aravalis. The plant turned defunct in 2013 after a fire./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Delhi doctor to find how bad air hurts lungs,"NEW DELHI: In about seven years, Indians would know to what extent air pollution may be impacting their lung function. Dr Anurag Agrawal, principal scientist at CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), would start work next month on one of the first long-term studies involving children (10-18 years) from across the study. Agrawal is among lakhs of Delhiites directly affected by severe air pollution. He's an asthmatic, but believes air pollution is only one of the several factors affecting lung function. /""Indians have 30% lower lung function than a white European of the same height, weight, age and gender. In the very famous Framinghan heart study (US based National Heart Institute started the study in 1948) they found if you have a low lung function, your risk of an early cardiac death increases. We know Indians die much faster of cardiac issues. We have drugs to treat cholesterol but no good drugs to treat lung function. Poor lung function is probably only a marker and not a cause of death. I think that the same things that make people die of cardiac problems, also cause them to have smaller lungs-one of which could be air pollution. We don't know yet. This study area is relatively new to our lab,"" Dr Agrawal said.His team plans to measure lung function of children in classes VI, IX and XII in different parts of the country through a network of schools. ""We hope to see what the biggest causes of reduced lung function are. The team will complete its first round or the baseline in the next couple of years. Two types of tests will be conducted: a lung capacity test where a child has to breathe in and breathe out; another in which multi-frequency pressure waves are fed into the lungs and the flow measured. A portable device called pulmoscan is being built for such testing and a working prototype is ready. The study will help researchers understand whether lung function starts reducing very early in childhood or much later,"" Agrawal said. ""By Class VI (10 years old) alveolar development is mostly done. We have to see from then if the problem becomes worse. AIIMS data suggests Indians have smaller lungs throughout their lives, but it's proportionate to their body size in early life. What I am looking for is reduction in lung size disproportionate to their body size in early life,"" he said. In the 1950s, the British looked at lung function of Indians. They covered Rajput cavalrymen, South Indian civil servants and Gorkha fighters. Only Gorkhas had lungs comparable to or better than the British. They thought probably it had got to do with exercise. But Agrawal points out another dimension of the problem: that of poor nutrition of girls and mothers. ""Nutrition of mothers highlighted in the DOHaD (Developmental Origin of Health and Disease) study found that most diseases can be tracked back to the early fetal periods. Risk of diabetes comes from poor nutrition of mothers. It basically said if you want to change society, take care of the girlchild. DOHaD hypothesis is very compelling. Even with lung function, my personal bias is towards the DOHaD hypothesis,"" he said. The team plans to include children in corporation schools. ""Delhi's air never becomes good because there is also a lot of natural dust. It is almost certain to be bad for health but we need local research to understand better. Look at the dust near the Rani Jhansi flyover. It will be interesting to study children from civic schools in these locations,"" Agrawal said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Health cost of air pollution 8 times spent on fuel subsidies in India: Report,"NEW DELHI: A new report by Health and Environment Alliance (HEAL), an European environmental non-profit has assessed the spending of seven economically powerful countries on fossil fuel subsidies and health costs associated with fossil fuel subsidies. India, according to the report spent as much as $16.9 billion on oil, gas and coal subsidies in 2013 and 2014 but health costs to meet the burden of air pollution linked diseases is eight times the fossil fuel subsidies at 140.7 billion dollars.The report ""Hidden Price Tags"" highlights that India can provide 375 million households with solar lamps or train nearly 32,000 extra doctors for rural areas with the fossil fuel subsidy spending of $16.9 billion annually. This is assessed considering that each solar lamp costs about $22.5, and All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS') recent estimates suggest a cost of Rs 1.7 crore to educate a doctor. The subsidy amount could even fund 24% of the total money needed to implement health care coverage for all Indians, the report suggests.Making a case for spending fossil fuel subsidy money on public health instead, the report released on Thursday claims that G20 governments spent about $444 billion in subsidies to fossil fuel companies in 2014, but the health costs of these subsidies in the form of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, premature deaths is as high as $2.76 trillion, six times the subsidy amount.The report calls for reallocation of fossil fuel subsidies because they increase the price gap between fossil fuels and renewables, which makes fossil fuels seem cheaper and discourages investment in green energy. /HEAL has used a combination of data provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) and Oil Change International (OCI) to arrive at their findings. For subsidy estimates, data from ODI and OCI were used for 2013 and 2014 which includes national subsidies delivered through direct spending and tax breaks, investments by state owned enterprises and public finance from government owned banks.On India's spending on fossil fuel subsidies, researchers from the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) who drafted the India chapter noted that two-thirds of electricity in India continues to be generated from coal, one of the biggest contributors of air pollution. Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Kerosene are also subsidized. The report says not all fossil fuels are bad, in fact LPG has significant health benefits when its used to substitute biomass or coal as cooking fuel. ""About 400 million households have been helped to make the switch from burning solid fuels to the healthier LPG option with the help of subsidy schemes since 1980. But population growth has resulted in over two thirds of households burning highly carbon-emitting biomass fuels for cooking with resulting health impacts,"" the report states. The fact that India has ambitious renewable energy targets that of meeting more than 50% of installed power capacity with renewable energy by 2027 is encouraging, authors said.On kerosene, the authors note that ""as much as half of subsidised kerosene is simply sold on the black market since it can be used in diesel engines."" Kerosene is ""poor man's fuel"" used by millions of households in rural India to meet basic lighting needs. Government subsidies make the fuel more affordable by selling it for half its market value but it kerosene smoke is rich in black carbon and kerosene poisoning among children remains a concern, authors note. Solar lamps are more viable than kerosene lamps. China spent about $96.5 billion on fossil fuel subsidies and its associated health costs are $1,785.4 billion, 19 times the subsidy amount.The report overall mainly recommends reforms in subsidies offered by two fossil fuels which cause significant harm health: coal combustion and pollution from diesel vehicle exhaust pipes./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Pollution levels shoot up in city,"GURUGRAM: While air pollution levels were low for a change in Gurgaon during the past week, levels of PM2.5 again increased on Thursday, making Gurgaon the second most polluted city in the country.The highest level of PM2.5 was 89.90 micrograms per cubic metre at 7.30pm. The city's air quality index (AQI), however, remained at 170, which is considered 'moderate' and it can cause breathing discomfort to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. According to the national safe standard, the level of PM2.5 shouldn't be more than 60 micrograms per cubic metre.Even though the level of PM2.5 is not very high, experts say that it is unusual in this season. /""There are only a few cities in the country that report a high level of PM2.5 during this season. These cities are generally located close to industrial areas. However, it is not so in Gurgaon. The Millennium City has very few highly polluting industries. Faridabad, which is an industrial hub, on the other hand, reported AQI at 67, which is considered 'satisfactory'. The authorities really need to examine why the air pollution levels are rising in the city despite favourable weather conditions,"" said Debjani Ghosh, an environment engineer.Officials of Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), on the other hand, refuted the claims saying various factors were responsible for a rise in the PM2.5 level. ""First of all, the air quality is 'moderate' in the city. Also, we can't blame the rising level of air pollution or one pollutant on one particular factor. Proximity of the city with Delhi and traffic congestion sometimes increase the level of PM2.5 during peak hours in the evening,"" said an HSPCB official, requesting anonymity./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

Centre tells SC no proof of bad air killing people,"NEW DELHI: The national capital may be one of the most polluted cities in the world with some studies even claiming that 3,000 people die every year due to air pollution-related diseases, but the Centre has told the Supreme Court that there was no conclusive and reliable proof to link premature deaths to pollution levels in the city. The ministry of environment, forests and climate change has disputed the findings of studies done by various national and international organisations on deaths caused due to air pollution and told the apex court not to rely on them while passing orders to deal with the menace of deteriorating air quality in the city.As per the Global Burden of Disease estimates for 2017, early deaths related to PM2.5 in India are the second highest in the world and ozone-related deaths, though lower than PM2.5, are the highest in the world. An epidemiological study done by Central Pollution Control Board and Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute of Kolkata showed that every third child has reduced lung function. /The report said that sputum of children contains four times more iron-laden macrophages than those from cleaner environs, indicating pulmonary haemorrhage.The Health Effects Study of Boston in 2010 on air pollution in NCR showed that there were at least 3,000 early deaths in Delhi every year due to air pollution-related diseases which meant eight deaths a day. Several other studies over time have also established lethal health impact of pollution and the Supreme Court had relied on them while passing a slew of directions, including ban on sale of firecrackers and putting restrictions of sale of polluting vehicles in the city.Questioning the veracity of those reports, the Centre has said that further studies are required for clinical corrections as these were not conducted in reference to Indian conditions.""These numbers are not validated for Indian conditions and there was no conclusive data available to establish direct correlation of death exclusively with the air. Health effects of air pollution are cumulative manifestation of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity etc of the individuals,"" the affidavit said.""Air pollution is one of the triggering factors for respiratory-associated ailments and diseases and it is acknowledged that higher the level of air pollution, higher is the risk to lungs in a given area. In Delhi, ozone levels are within the permissible levels, therefore the estimate of higher number of ozone deaths is not clear,"" it said.""The government said there were many confounding factors and it needed further studies to come to a conclusive finding on adverse health impact of pollution. These international references without proper validation of data with reference to Indian conditions not only portray wrong image of the country but also effect decision making and policy formulation, which ultimately may not be problem specific,"" it said./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"

India trucking into gas age as govt clears norms for LNG stations,"NEW DELHI: India appears to be trotting along towards becoming the latest country to run long-distance trucks and buses on LNG, or gas imported in ships, with an eye on reducing air pollution from vehicular emission. After approving the green fuel for automotive use, the government has now notified changes in the gas cylinder norms to pave the way for LNG refuelling stations and help start commercial service by LNG vehicles.The commerce and industry ministry has notified the amendments to rules governing use of cylinders carrying gas under pressure. This will help establish a storage and supply chain for LNG stations through 'daughter trucks', just like for CNG stations in cities. /""Use of LNG as transport fuel features in the priority list of #ModiGovt. Proposed amendments will help in setting up the required infrastructure,"" oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan tweeted on Friday after receiving a letter from commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman.TOI had on August 16 first reported that India's smoke-spewing long-haul goods and passenger transport fleet is in for a green makeover as truck and bus manufacturers such as Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, Mahindra & Mahindra and BharatBenz are stepping on the gas with LNG version of their vehicles. Some of these manufacturers have already applied for vehicle 'type approval', a matter of 2-3 months.The makeover is being driven by Petronet LNG, India's largest LNG importer. Petronet is setting up 20 LNG stations at petrol pumps on highways along the west coast that connect Delhi with Thiruvananthapuram covering a total distance of 4,500 km via Mumbai and Bengaluru.""Today you don't think twice before hitting the highway in your car as you are sure of getting fuel. We want to establish a similar certainty for LNG. Talks are on with oil marketing companies for LNG facilities at petrol pumps and Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation for clearance,"" company MD Prabhat Singh had told TOI.Petronet is eyeing 2.5 lakh new trucks and 85,000 buses that join the fleet every year. ""Besides, we are also talking to Gujarat and Kerala road transport corporations for running 20 and 10 LNG buses, respectively, in the first phase. Altogether, we see potential of 8-9 million tonne of annual LNG sales in the automotive sector, in say, five years,"" Singh had said.This will make the Indian transport sector the latest entrant - after a handful of nations led by the US and China - to the LNG covenant. For a country where the transport sector guzzles 40% of diesel sales, the environmental benefit from LNG, in terms of reduced vehicular pollution, will be huge.A 2015 Morgan Stanley report said globally natural gas vehicles were displacing 1.5 million barrels a day of oil. That number could double - or even grow by another 5.6 million barrels a day, equivalent to China's oil imports in 2015 - by 2021./For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
19% auto drivers suffer from restrictive lung functioning: Study,"MANGALURU: A study report suggests that 19% of the auto rickshaw drivers in Mangaluru suffer from restrictive lung functioning (RLF) and 3.46% exhibited obstructive lung functioning (OLF). The Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) conducted by a team of Anti-Pollution Drive (APD) Foundation revealed the impact of air pollution on the health of auto rickshaw drivers in the city. The study report clearly showed that around 1/5th of the auto drivers in the city are adversely affected by air pollution. The foundation will submit the report to the government and seek measures to check pollution and help those in trouble. /After having conducted similar tests on traffic police in Mangaluru and Bengaluru, the foundation has now successfully concluded its second edition of tests on outdoor workers of Mangaluru, with focus on auto drivers of Mangaluru.""The foundation had also commissioned an air quality assessment study called 'Shudda Gaali' last year. These initiatives are part of APD's continuous quest to gather scientific data on the impact of pollution on civil society and explore ways to mitigate it,"" said Abdullah A Rehman, founder, APD Foundation.The present study on the impact of air pollution on auto drivers was undertaken in April, he said. ""Around 510 drivers were selected from 15 auto stands. After isolating the smokers, the sample size was reduced to 405. Among these 314 drivers had normal lung functioning. 77 exhibited restrictive lung functioning and 14 showed the symptoms of obstructive lung functioning. This data clearly shows that around 1/5th of the total sample population has been adversely effected by air pollution. It must be remembered here that auto rickshaws are the biggest vehicular air pollutants along with other public transport vehicles. Comprehensive preventive measures are urgently needed in this segment of road users to reduce the further impact of pollution on the citizens,"" Abdullah said.The study was assigned to a group of MBA students belonging to IFIM Business School, Bangalore.

TMC begins expansion of century-old crematorium,"THANE: The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), in collaboration with a private trust, is working towards revamping the century-old Jawahar Baug crematorium in central Thane and convert it into a eco-friendly one. The revamp is part of the crematorium overhaul plan, following requests from residents and elected representatives for increased and improved facilities. A city-based NGO has expressed interest in developing the facility using its CSR funds and is likely to complete work by next year. /As per plans, the existing open cremation pyres will be converted into fumeless ones by including an enclosed chamber for lighting the pyre.

The new facility will ensure minimal release of smoke from pyres into the air, reducing the pollution levels in the adjoining areas. Also, the time required to complete a cremation will also be reduced, said an official from the civic corporation.

The revamp plan also includes changing the entry towards the facility, which would be from the Dadoji Konddeo stadium end. There will be adequate parking facility for ambulances and hearse within the facility too, said an official.
